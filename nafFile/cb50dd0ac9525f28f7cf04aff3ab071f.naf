<raw><![CDATA[   * C$ falls to 96.29 U.S. cents * Bonds prices rise across curve * Fed Beige Book indicates U.S. economy not robust (Updates to close, adds comments) By Claire Sibonney TORONTO, July 28 (Reuters) - The Canadian currency fell fora second straight session against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday,dragged lower by U.S. data that signaled persistent headwindsfor the global recovery. The Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book reported overalleconomic activity is still increasing but not robustly and in afew areas has lost steam. [ID:nWALSIE6ES] It pointed tosluggish housing markets and weakening sales of costly itemslike new cars in the United States, by far Canada's biggesttrading partner. The Canadian dollar fell as low as C$1.0390 to the U.S.dollar, or 96.25 U.S. cents, nearly matching its overnight low,following the U.S. summary of national economic conditions. "The Beige Book is not flagging a double-dip recession butit's also not painting a very flattering picture of theeconomy," said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO CapitalMarkets. "Unfortunately, we're not seeing any bounce in home saleseven three months after the tax credit expired; we're notseeing much improvement in labor markets," Guatieri said. The currency  finished not far off its low of theday at C$1.0385 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.29 U.S. cents, downfrom Tuesday's finish at C$1.0362 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.51U.S. cents. Before the Fed's report was released, the Canadian dollarhad already given back gains from an earlier rally, in linewith declining equity markets, as conflicting U.S. reportsshowed improved corporate earnings and falling orders fordurable goods. As well, oil slipped below $77 a barrel after economic andindustry data fueled doubts over the pace of recovery in energydemand, which also weighed on the commodity-linked currency.[O/R] [MET/L] BONDS EXTEND GAINS Canadian bond prices followed U.S. Treasury issues higher,which were supported after a $37 billion auction of five-yearnotes met with healthy demand and after the Beige Book. [US/] The Beige Book report also fit in with data that showed neworders for U.S. manufactured goods like cars and planes fellunexpectedly for a second straight month in June, posting thelargest drop since August. [ID:nN28189480] "There's been a real lack of Canadian data this week sowe're trading off the U.S.," said Kam Bath, fixed incomestrategist at RBC Capital Markets. "The durable goods report was soft, even though it's a veryvolatile number; it weighed on sentiment." While Statistics Canada presents its GDP figures for May atthe end of the week, the data is likely to be overshadowed byU.S. second-quarter GDP numbers, due at the same time. The Canadian two-year bond  was up 8 Canadiancents to yield 1.601 percent, while the 10-year bond gained 37 Canadian cents to yield 3.228 percent. Canadian bonds outperformed U.S. Treasury issues in theshort- and long-end of the curve, but underperformed in thebelly. The Canadian 10-year bond was 23 basis points above thecomparable U.S. bond, compared with 22.3 basis points in theprevious session.
