<raw><![CDATA[ * Political debate turns to protectionism in election year * Socialists want tariffs linked to labour, climate rules * Scant European support for protectionism  By Paul Taylor PARIS, April 18 (Reuters) - An old French idea is blossomingagain in the Paris springtime. France's Socialists have just embraced a form of Europeantrade protectionism in their manifesto, a shift from their previous endorsement of globalisation as a win-win propositionfor French workers. The shift matters both because the Socialists and theirGreen allies have a good chance of unseating centre-rightPresident Nicolas Sarkozy in next year's election, and becauseFrance has a way of setting the political agenda in Europe. "Europe is the only continent that imposes free trade onitself in a world that is constantly making exceptions," theprogramme adopted by the Socialist party on April 9 said. Declaring that Europe should be neither a fortress nor asieve, the Socialists want international labour, environmentaland health and safety standards built into world trade rules. Failing that, "we will propose putting in place tariff locksat Europe's borders" until exporting countries adopt normsapplied in Europe to issues such as trade union rights, childlabour and carbon emissions. Furthermore, the Socialists want the European Union toinsert tougher "fair trade" safeguard clauses in agreements withthird countries, enabling the EU to reimpose tariffs to halt anyimport surge threatening European industry. And they demand that the executive European Commissionpublish a study assessing the impact of each new trade agreementon European industry and employment before it is signed. The Socialists' U-turn on trade is largely driven bydomestic politics, and while it resembles positions taken by theU.S. Democratic Party, it has little support so far in otherEuropean countries, except perhaps Italy. It is an attempt to win back the "losers of globalisation"-- the unemployed, remnants of the industrial working class andmiddle-class voters who fear their living standards are falling. Some of these voters are defecting to the far-right NationalFront under new leader Marine Le Pen, who has made inroads byattacking immigration and Islam but also advocating dumping theeuro and re-erecting customs barriers at France's borders. On the hard left, Communists, Trotskyists and the Left Partysiphon off up to 15 percent of the vote with anti-globalisationrhetoric. The ecologist Greens also see themselves as part of the"altermondialiste" movement, a French term that implies theyfavour some alternative model of globalisation, but not theexisting one. In fact, free trade has little political constituency inFrance. While the seafaring British and Dutch have long beenfree traders, the French boast a protectionist traditionreaching back at least to the 17th century mercantilistJean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV's finance minister. More recently, Maurice Allais, one of France's rare Nobeleconomics prizewinners, published diatribes against free tradewith emerging economies until his death last year, warning thatit would cause mass unemployment and depression in Europe. Another contrarian intellectual, demographer Emmanuel Todd,is campaigning for European protectionism -- and an exit fromthe euro -- saying the loss of jobs will otherwise tear apartthe fabric of French society. Yet Europe has few natural resources and relies for itsprosperity on exporting high added-value goods and services. Therising middle classes of China and India want to drive Germancars, wear French or Italian fashions and fly European planes. European tariffs might perpetuate yesterday's industrialjobs at the expense of tomorrow's knowledge economy. And Asiannations would almost certainly retaliate if Europe startedclosing its markets because their wage bargaining or carbonemissions were not up to scratch. However, French trade unions and businesses seek protectionwhen offshoring, outsourcing, cheap imports or a strong eurothreaten jobs, while world-leading French companies may bereluctant to advertise the benefits of globalisation for fear ofattracting confiscatory taxation at home. The interests of producers have long outweighed those ofconsumers in France, where an influential farmers' lobby is abedrock of support for Sarkozy's Gaullist UMP party. The president himself has flirted with the language ofEuropean protectionism, branding EU trade policy "naive" andcalling for a "Community preference" in trade. But he has donelittle about it in practice since he took office in 2007. With no political mileage in free trade, he spurned calls tomake concluding the World Trade Organisation's long-stalled Doharound of negotiations a priority of France's presidency of theG20 group of major economies this year. While the French public discourse is clearly set to turnmore protectionist in the run-up to next April's presidentialelection, there are good grounds for putting your fingers inyour ears and waiting for it to blow over. For one thing, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the frontrunner to beSocialist candidate, is no protectionist. As head of theInternational Monetary Fund, he has resisted pressure to rollback globalisation since the onset of the global financialcrisis in 2008. Secondly, trade policy is anchored in EU treaties and run bythe European Commission, which is firmly in the free-trade camp,although it is more concerned than in the past to win reciprocalmarket access from trading partners. And thirdly, the French drift towards protectionism has nosupport in Germany, Paris' vital partner in EU leadership. "For the Social Democratic Party, this would be consideredsheer madness," says Ernst Hillbrand of the Friedrich EbertFoundation, a think tank close to Germany's opposition SPD. Some Germans fret about EU rules that allow cheap contractlabour from new member states in eastern Europe to work inGermany, undercutting union-negotiated wages. "But the general mood among the German population is stillthat we are benefiting more from globalisation than we arelosing out," he said, quoting a German industrialist as saying:"China will become the factory of the world, but we will buildthat factory."
