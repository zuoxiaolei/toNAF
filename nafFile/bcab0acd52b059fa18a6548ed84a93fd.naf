<raw><![CDATA[ * May US payrolls growth seen highest in 26 years on census * Rebounding equities may find support from US jobs number * Risks emanating from Europe still are large By Kevin Plumberg HONG KONG, June 4 (Reuters) - The dollar steadied on Fridayand Asian stocks slipped on profit taking ahead of a reportexpected to show the highest U.S. jobs growth since 1983,supporting this week's wary move back into riskier assets. More than two-thirds of the forecast 513,000 new jobs willlikely be temporary hires for the government census, givingmixed signals to investors eager to take profits on theirbullish bets on the dollar, which hit a four-year high againstthe euro on Tuesday. Financial bookmakers reckoned major European stock indexeswould open up as much as 0.5 percent ahead of the payrollsreport, which is used as a gauge of the U.S. economy. U.S.stock futures drifted lower in calm trade. Global equity markets and U.S. Treasury yields over thepast week have both recovered nearly a quarter of the lossesincurred over the last two months when the European sovereigndebt crisis triggered a scramble out of risk. The U.S. payrolls report may provide a supportive role tothis rebound. "There is talk of 600,000 jobs being added and that kind ofnumber will show that the U.S. economy is showing considerablemomentum," said Tony Morriss, senior currency strategist at ANZin Sydney. Still, fears about tougher funding conditions in Europe andthe impact of spartan fiscal policy on growth may keep a heavylid on the nascent revival in risk taking. Indeed, Hungary's ruling party on Thursday said thecountry's finances were in much worse shape than previouslyexpected, an echo of recent warnings from Greece. The euro was largely unchanged from Thursday in New York at$1.2178, still trying to climb from an overnight low of$1.2150. It touched a four-year low around $1.2110 on Tuesday. The dollar was up 0.1 percent against the yen at 92.67 yen.Speculation that Japan's next prime minister will be morehawkish against yen strength has spurred traders to cut theirbets on the yen this week. Finance Minister Naoto Kan was chosen as Japan's next primeminister, the ageing and deeply indebted country's fifthpremier in three years. In equity markets, the MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocksoutside Japan edged down 0.3 percent, weighed mostly by profittaking in the materials sector after a surge on Thursday. The index is trading at 12 times forecast 12-monthearnings, the lowest valuation since March 2009, when thelatest bull market began. That kind of value is probably enoughto pull some investors back into the market, though uncertaintyover Europe could keep intraday volatility high. Japan's Nikkei share average finished 0.1 percent lowerafter posting its biggest single-day rise in six months onThursday. Shares of retailers were the biggest drag on theindex, while exporters and technology sector stocks offeredsupport. The prospect of a new prime minister that would keep theyen weak was seen as a plus for exporters, though it was stilltoo early to drive trading consistently. "There's still a lot that's unknown -- who will be in thecabinet, what the policies will be. That makes it hard for themarket to take it up as a factor," said Yutaka Miura, seniortechnical analyst at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. U.S. crude for July delivery slipped 0.4 percent to $74.34a barrel. Oil is down nearly $12 in the last month.
