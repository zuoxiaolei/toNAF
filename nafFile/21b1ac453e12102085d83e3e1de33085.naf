<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The New Zealand dollar was higher against its U.S. counterpart on Thursday, following a surprise liquidity move by China, although but gains were capped by sustained concerns over the handling of Spain and Greece's financial troubles.NZD/USD hit 0.8278 during European morning trade, the pair's highest since September 24; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.8265, adding 0.28%.The pair was likely to find support at 0.8185, Wednesday's low and resistance at 0.8311, the high of September 23.The kiwi gained ground amid reports the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China injected a record CNY365 billion, or USD58 billion, this week into the Chinese banking system, easing liquidity conditions ahead of the end of the current quarter and before the Golden Week holidays next week.China is New Zealand's second biggest export partner.But markets were jittery as Spain remained reluctant to request a bailout and trigger the European Central Bank's new bond-buying program.Later in the day, Madrid was to present its draft budget for next year and announce structural reforms, while the results of bank stress tests are due on Friday. Demonstrators clashed with police on the streets of Athens and Madrid this week in an upsurge of popular anger at new austerity measures being imposed on two of the euro zone's most vulnerable economies.Earlier in the day, the National Bank of New Zealand said that its index of business confidence declined to 17.00 in September, from a reading of 19.50 the previous month.Elsewhere, the kiwi was higher against the euro with EUR/NZD falling 0.14%, to hit 1.5596.Later Thursday, the U.S. was to publish government data on durable goods orders, as well as a weekly report on unemployment claims and revised data on second quarter economic growth.
