<raw><![CDATA[ LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Britain's economy has turned acorner thanks to unprecedented stimulus measures, weakersterling and the end of the destocking cycle, but the recoverywill be slow, Bank of England chief economist Spencer Dale said.In a speech to business leaders on Thursday, Dale alsowarned that the recovery faced challenges from much-neededadjustments to banks' balance sheets and global trade flows. "The economy appears to have turned. And the most recentoutput data and business surveys suggest that we are likely tosee positive growth in the second half of 2009," he said,according to a text of his speech. "Economic activity is being supported further by the easingin fiscal policy, the substantial depreciation in sterling, andby the fact that the inventory adjustment appears to bebeginning to run its course," he said. The pound has lost around a quarter of its value since June2007, a recovery since the turn of the year has been fitful,with the currency hitting a five-month low against the euroearlier on Thursday. "Even if output does expand in the second half of this year,for many families and businesses it may still feel like we arein the economic doldrums ... the recovery may be slow andprotracted," Dale said. He also warned that much-needed structural changes to theglobal economy, banks' balance sheets and Britain's tradepatterns could yet throw the recovery off track. "The structural adjustments that need to occur -- to thestructure of the banking system; to the balance of global tradeflows, and to the level of public and possibly household debt --have the potential to delay and derail the recovery.  "But monetary policy can not -- and should not -- seek toprevent those adjustments. They are necessary for the long-runstability of our economy."  MEDICINE WORKING Dale said the BoE's QE programme appeared to be working andplayed down policymakers' August split on whether to expand theprogramme to 175 billion pounds or 200 billion pounds."As with changes in interest rates, it will take some timebefore we see the impact of our purchases feeding through intohigher aggregate spending and inflation. However, there are someencouraging signs that the medicine is working," he said. Dale said he had been wary of siding with Governor MervynKing and two other Monetary Policy Committee members in votingfor 200 billion pounds of asset purchases because he was worriedit could lead to an unwarranted rise in the price of someassets. "It is important not to make too much of this difference;all members were of the view that a further degree of monetarystimulus was needed to meet the inflation target.""My own judgment was that the uncertainty surrounding boththe economic outlook and the effects of asset purchases made itdifficult to have a strong view as to the relative merits," hesaid.
