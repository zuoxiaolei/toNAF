<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar was broadly higher against the other major currencies on Friday as upbeat U.S. data fuelled expectations for an early end to the Federal Reserve’s easing program, while weak data in the euro zone and U.K. supported safe haven demand.Data on Friday showed that the U.S. manufacturing sector expanded at its fastest pace since June 2011 last month, while a separate report showed that U.S. consumer confidence rose in February.The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 54.2 from 53.1 in January, while the final reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index came in at 77.6, from a preliminary reading of 76.3.In contrast, revised data showed that manufacturing activity in the euro zone contracted in February at the same pace as in January, with the manufacturing PMI unchanged at 47.8. The weak data added to speculation over a possible rate cut by the European Central Bank at its upcoming policy meeting on Thursday.The single currency also remained under pressure amid concerns that that Italy would not be able to continue to implement structural reforms and austerity measures following inconclusive election results.The euro fell below 1.30 against the dollar for the first time since December 11, with EUR/USD hitting a session low of 1.2967, before settling at 1.3018, down 0.29% for the day and 0.38% lower for the week.Meanwhile, the pound fell below 1.50 against the dollar for the first time since July 2010 as unexpectedly weak U.K. manufacturing data added to expectations that the Bank of England will resume its quantitative easing program.The U.K. manufacturing PMI fell to 47.9 from 50.5 in January, well below the 50 level that divides growth from contraction, as employment levels in the sector fell at the fastest pace in more than three years.GBP/USD hit a session low of 1.4986 before settling at 1.5035, 0.85% lower for the day and down 0.86% for the week. The dollar rallied more than 1% against the yen on Friday, the largest one-day gain in more than three weeks amid increasing speculation that the Bank of Japan will step up easing measures after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe nominated an advocate of aggressive easing to head the central bank.USD/JPY hit a session high of 93.69, the highest since February 25, before settling at 93.54, 1.06% higher for the day and up 1.26% for the week.The dollar also found support amid worries over U.S. spending cuts, known as the sequester, after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a deficit reduction plan.Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar pulled back from multi-month lows against the greenback on Friday after data showed the Canadian economy contracted by 0.2% in December, in line with expectations, indicating that markets had been prepared for weaker-than-forecast data. The Canadian economy expanded by an annualized 0.6% in the fourth quarter, matching forecasts.USD/CAD hit a session high of 1.0342, the pair’s highest since June 28, before falling back to settle at 1.0268, 0.38% lower for the day and just 0.09% higher for the week.In the week ahead, markets will be focusing on interest rate decisions by the ECB, BoE, Reserve Bank of Australia, Bank of Canada and the BoJ.
