<raw><![CDATA[   * Sees 2010/11 op profit at Y80 bln vs consensus Y88 bln * Q4 op profit at Y29.5 bln vs consensus Y19.2 bln * Chairman worries about crisis in Greece * Aims to boost car sales by 5.7 pct in year to March 2011 * Shares end up 1.5 pct before results (Recasts with chairman comments and details) TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Suzuki Motor Corp, Japan's No.4automaker, forecast flat operating profits this year, belowmarket expectations, as a firmer yen and turmoil in Europecounter the impact of a sales increase led by India. The cautious outlook from Suzuki, 20 percent owned byGermany's Volkswagen, followed similarly conservative guidancefrom larger rival Honda Motor Co and raised concerns ahead ofearnings from heavyweight Toyota Motor Co on Tuesday. "I hope Suzuki's pessimistic view toward the euro and theEuropean economy is very conservative," said Kazutaka Oshima,President of Rakuten Investment Management. "I am now concerned about Toyota's earnings tomorrow. I amnow worried how the crisis in Greece would have an impact onJapanese car makers." Suzuki has outperformed the industry in the past few yearsas consumers around the world shift to smaller, morefuel-efficient cars such as its Swift and Alto hatchbacks. Analysts said Suzuki would also benefit from recentlyexpanded capacity in its biggest market India -- at 1 millionunits a year as of March -- before it adds another 250,000units from April 2012 to cement its dominance in thefast-growing Indian market. But a weaker euro originating from Greece's debt woes mayerode its profit. "I am afraid the crisis may hit not only the euro, but alsothe economy in entire Europe and other currencies," chairmanOsamu Suzuki told a news conference. "It may sound I am praying to God for help, but I wish thenegative impact on the economy would be limited." For the year to March 31, 2011, Suzuki forecast anoperating profit of 80 billion yen ($874 million), 0.8 percentup from the 79.36 billion yen it made last year. It expects netprofit to grow 3.8 percent to 30 billion yen. A survey of 18 brokerages by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S showedthat on average they expect operating profit of 88 billion yenfor 2010/11. Led by the Indian market, Suzuki expects to boost itsglobal vehicle sales by 5.7 percent to 2.482 million units thisfinancial year. But the firm forecast a stronger yen would have a negativeimpact of 24 billion yen in its operating profit. Suzukiassumes the yen to average 90 to the dollar and 115 to theeuro, compared with current levels around 93 and 121. INDIA MARGINS PRESSURED Operating profit in the final, January-March quarter was29.5 billion yen, compared with a profit of 10.45 billion yen ayear earlier. The result was better than the 19.2 billion yenaverage estimate in the poll of brokerages. Fourth-quarter net profit came to 13.4 billion yen versus aprofit of 5.8 billion yen a year ago. Last month, Indian unit Maruti Suzuki India Ltd missedforecasts for fourth-quarter net profit and warned of marginpressure and slower sales growth as global automakers pile intothe competitive compact car market. Suzuki must also repair its ailing motorcycle business,which unlike Honda successful operations, has yet to recoverfrom a sales slump as consumers stay away from leisureproducts. Further out, analysts are looking for Suzuki to realisesynergies from its tie-up with Volkswagen. "When we announced the tie-up, I assumed it would take ayear to discuss between the two companies what we would do. Weare in talks, but nothing has been decided," said the chairman. Suzuki's shares have fallen more than 20 percent since itagreed its deal with Volkswagen last December, underperforminga 1 percent rise in Tokyo's transport equipment subindex overthe same period. Before the announcement, Suzuki's shares closed up 1.5percent at 1,858 yen, matching the market's rise.
