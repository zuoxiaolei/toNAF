<raw><![CDATA[  * Euro falls versus Swiss franc for fifth day * Comments by Eurogroup's Juncker put markets on edge * Euro surrenders gains after rising above $1.42 (Updates prices, adds quotes, background) By Julie Haviv NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro hit a record lowversus the Swiss franc on Thursday on mounting doubts whetherGreece will receive its next round of aid from the IMF, and theworries are likely to keep the single currency under pressure. Comments by Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the Eurogroupfinance ministers, raised concerns that Greece may not get thenext 12 billion euros in aid from the International MonetaryFund that is needed to cover immediate funding needs. Fordetails, see [ID:nLDE74P1Z2] Heightened anxiety over Europe's sovereign debt crisis hasdriven the five-day slide in the euro versus the safe-havenSwissie. "The currency pair's performance is a reflection of theextreme nervousness existing in the market in relation to thesovereign debt crisis," said Kathy Lien, director of currencyresearch at GFT Forex in New York. "There has been a lot ofback and forth between the EU and the ECB on IMF aid to Greece,and that does not help the euro at all." The euro fell as low as 1.22045 Swiss francs on electronictrading platform EBS  and last traded down 0.5percent on the day at 1.2234 francs. It also hit a 2-1/2-month low against sterling. Inspectors from the European Union, the European CentralBank and the IMF must assess whether Greece has made sufficientprogress to receive the next round of aid under the country's110 billion euro international bailout, though there is notspecific date set for a decision. Government officials havesaid that the next installment must be disbursed by July 15.[ID:nN26191961]^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ IMF threat on Greek aid spooks markets     [ID:nLDE74P1HC] Other euro zone crisis stories             [ID:nLDE68T0MG] Graphic on debt contagion   http://link.reuters.com/zys69r Graphics on debt crisis        http://r.reuters.com/hyb65p^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Because Switzerland relies heavily on its exports, theSwiss National Bank could attempt to talk the franc lower sincedirect intervention in the past has fallen short ofexpectations, Lien said. "The performance of the Swiss franc is something to keep aneye on as it serves as an important gauge of sentiment in theeuro zone," she said. Against the dollar, the euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.4128. It earlier rose to $1.42069 on EBS after an articlein the Financial Times quoted the chief of the EuropeanFinancial Stability Facility as saying China was "clearlyinterested" in buying bonds for the Portugal bailout to beissued in mid-June. [ID:nL3E7GQ04U] The euro's support lies around the psychologicallyimportant level of $1.4000, traders said, which also marks the200-week moving average. The 100-day moving average is ataround $1.3996. If the euro makes a sustained break below $1.4000, then$1.3770, a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the euro'srise from June 2010 to May 2011, may be a key support, traderssaid. GROWING PRESSURE Pressure has grown on Greece to accelerate reforms andasset sales in return for international aid. Fears of apotential restructuring of Greek debt and the potential ofcontagion to bigger economies such as Spain and Italy havepushed the euro down 6 percent against the dollar since May. Brown Brothers Harriman said while the odds of Greeceexiting the euro zone are no longer insignificant, it is not ashigh as 50 percent as some speculate. "However, we do agree that bondholders will eventually haveto accept significant haircuts on principal," the firm noted."The only question is when, as European policy makers continueto try to kick the can down the road until 2013, when thebanking sector will be less vulnerable and will hopefully bestrong enough to take the hit." Against the yen, the U.S. dollar on Thursday fell 0.8percent to 81.30 yen after hitting a session low of 81.15 onEBS , hurt by disappointing U.S. economic data.[ID:nN26233734] The dollar hit a low of 79.56 yen earlier this month, butover the past week gains have been capped by the 100-day simplemoving average at 82.25. That level is a key resistance pointcreated not only by the moving average, but also the secondstandard deviation Bollinger band and the 38.2 percentFibonacci retracement of the March to April rally.
