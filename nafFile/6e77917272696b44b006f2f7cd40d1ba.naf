<raw><![CDATA[ * Asia-Pacific stocks ease on recovery doubts, Japansuffers * Rupiah leads Asian FX lower on capital control fears * US dollar decline takes a breather; Aussie falls 3rd day * Gold slips on profit taking but record high is close By Kevin Yao and Kevin Plumberg HONG KONG, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Asian stocks eased on doubtsabout the pace of economic recovery, while the Indonesianrupiah and the Idian rupee fell on concerns over official stepsto curb capital flows after Brazil's latest move to limit therise of its currency. Gold edged down as the dollar gained some ground againstthe euro and other major currencies, taking a breather afterhitting a record above $1,150 per ounce the previous day. After gains of nearly 70 percent in Asian equities so farthis year, investors are likely prone to taking profits beforeyear-end. A six-month low in U.S. housing construction in October andnews this week that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan'slargest bank, will have to raise $11 billion in new shares tomeet stricter capital requirements have underscored how theclimb back from the worst economic crisis in generations willbe slow. "With the capital raisings, the yen's strength andpolitics, there is three times the pain," said TomomiYamashita, a fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management, The Nikkei share average fell 1.3 percent to the lowestsince July 21, also on concerns over the government's fiscalpolicies. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan fellalmost 0.3 percent but still hovered near a 15-month highreached on Tuesday, The Thomson Reuters index of regionalshares was down around 0.5 percent. U.S. stocks futures were down 0.3 percent, indicating alower open later in the day. The dollar rebounded the against the euro and the yengained against high-yield currencies as investors, spooked byweaker equities performance and fears of capital controls inemerging markets, unwound positions in riskier assets. The high-yielding Australian dollar eased 0.3 percent to$0.9260 after touching the highest since Aug 1, 2008 on Monday,above $0.9400. CAPITAL CONTROLS Market fears over possible capital curbs by Indonesia haveeased after the central bank on Wednesday played down thethreat of immediate curbs, but investors sentiment was hurt byBrazil's move to curb capital inflows, traders said. Brazil took another step on Wednesday to try to contain theappreciation of its currency, unveiling a 1.5 percent tax oncertain trades involving American Depositary Receipts issued byBrazilian companies. The Indonesian rupiah fell 1 percent to 9,510 per dollar,prompting the central bank to intervene to support the unit,which remained the best performing currency in Asia. The Indian rupee slipped 0.7 percent to 46.51 per dollar asinvestors worried that authorities there may start looking atsteps to temper surging capital inflows. Taiwan has banned foreigners from investing in timedeposits and South Korea announced measures on Thursday aimedto tightening controls over currency liquidity to make thebanking system less vulnerable to the capital flight. But analysts believe most Asian countries will refrain fromimposing harsh measures to stem hot money inflows that coulddistort policy signals, but market jitters could persist. "Few things scare a foreign investor more than the thoughtthat the rules could be changed on them after they haveinvested and they will be either unable to access their fundseasily or will be suddenly driven out," said Westpac strategistSean Callow. "Given that it is so widely expected that USD/Asia willdecline for many months and quarters to come, investors willwonder why would the flurry of restrictions and proposals endhere?" he added. U.S. crude for December delivery was down 0.3 percent to$79.40 a barrel, after being unable to settle above $80 for a10th consecutive session.
