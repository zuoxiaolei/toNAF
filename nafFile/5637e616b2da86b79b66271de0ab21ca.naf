<raw><![CDATA[ * Cameron says UK economy has become over-indebted, unstable * Says debt is warning sign Britain is on wrong track  LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - Prime Minister David Cameron saidon Friday that Britain must rebalance an economy that has becomeover-indebted, unstable and too dependent on the public sector. In excerpts released in advance of a speech he was due togive later on Friday in northern England, Cameron said theBritish economy had been heading in the wrong direction foryears, was over-reliant on welfare and increasingly hostile toenterprise. It was billed as his first major speech since he becameprime minister this month, ending 13 years of Labour Party rule. Cameron, whose centre-right Conservatives formed a coalitionwith the smaller, centre-left Liberal Democrats after a May 6election failed to produce an outright winner, has set reducingBritain's large budget deficit as his top priority. "As a country we have become indebted on an unprecedentedscale. Our huge public debt is the clearest manifestation of oureconomic mistakes -- the glaring warning sign overhead tellingus we have taken the wrong route," he said. "We have been sleepwalking our way to an economy that isunsustainable, unstable, unfair and, frankly, uninspiring." The economy had become "far too dependent on the publicsector, with over half of all jobs created in the last 10 yearsassociated in some way with public spending," he said. Referring to London's financial services industry whichdrove British growth for years before being jolted by thefinancial crisis, Cameron said the economy had becomeincreasingly unbalanced, "with our fortunes hitched to a fewindustries in one corner of the country, while we let othersectors like manufacturing slide." Cameron said he believed Britain could rebalance economicpower across different regions and industries, inject new lifeinto the private sector and move to an economy built on savingsand investment rather than debt and borrowing. "We have set out a series of clear, transparent benchmarksfor our economy, from ensuring macroeconomic stability tocreating more balanced growth, getting Britain working andensuring our whole country shares in rising prosperity," hesaid. Cameron's coalition outlined this week 6.2 billion pounds($8.9 billion) of spending cuts this year. Further action totackle a deficit running at 11 percent of GDP -- just a fewpercentage points below that of Greece -- is expected in anemergency budget on June 22. However, senior lawmakers from Cameron's Conservative Partyare unhappy at plans to raise capital gains tax to bring itclose to income tax rates, a policy promoted by the Lib Dems. Cameron inherited an economy just emerging from deeprecession. The Office for National Statistics said this week theeconomy grew by 0.3 percent in the first quarter, up from aninitial estimate of 0.2 percent.
