<raw><![CDATA[ * IMF/EU say Hungary must take steps to meet budget goals * IMF says "range of issues remain open" * GDP growth seen 0.6 pct in 2010, at least 2.5 pct in 2011 * Hungary borrows from markets but programme a safety net  (Adds quotes from IMF mission head, economy minister) By Krisztina Than and Marton Dunai BUDAPEST, July 17 (Reuters) - The IMF and EU suspended onSaturday a review of Hungary's funding programme, set up in 2008to save the country from financial meltdown, saying it must taketough action to meet targets for cutting its budget deficit. Suspension of talks means Hungary will not have access toremaining funds in its $25.1 billion loan package, created bythe International Monetary Fund and European Union and which itnow uses as financial safety net, until the review is concluded. Negotiations with the lenders had been expected to finishearly next week. Analysts said the forint currency could fallsharply when financial markets reopen on Monday due touncertainty over the international safety net for Hungary, whichhas financed itself from the markets since last year. "In an environment of heightened market scrutiny ofgovernment deficits and debt levels, the fiscal deficit targetspreviously announced -- 3.8 percent of GDP in 2010 and below 3percent of GDP in 2011 -- remain an appropriate anchor for thenecessary consolidation process and debt sustainability, andshould be adhered to, but additional measures will need to betaken to achieve these objectives," the IMF said. "Sustainable consolidation will require durable,non-distortive measures, which the authorities need more time todevelop," it said in a statement. HITTING WHERE IT HURTS MOST Hungary's new centre-right government, which swept to powerin April elections, has said it wanted to extend its currentfinancing deal with lenders until the end of 2010 and seek aprecautionary deal for 2011 and 2012. Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy made clear the governmentwas keen to resume negotiations. "The government will of coursecontinue talks with international organisations including theIMF and the EU," he said in a statement published by thenational news agency MTI on Saturday. Christoph Rosenberg, who led the IMF delegation to Hungary,signalled that the Fund wanted more on next year's budget. "Bydefinition when we come next time -- unless we come next week --the government will have made more progress on the 2011 budgetand that will be a very important budget," he told Reuters. In an interview, he also said the IMF had not discussed thepossibility of a new financing deal for 2011 and 2012.  "We are aware of what has been said in public but in ourmeetings we didn't really get to that point, because weobviously needed to first resolve the policy issues and thosehave not been resolved," he said. The EU issued a separate statement saying the conclusion ofthe review had to be postponed and further talks should be heldat a later stage. "Hungary has returned to a positive economic growth path andnow has one of the lowest budget deficits in the EU. I welcomethe authorities' commitment to the 2010 deficit target," saidOlli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs. "However, the correction of the excessive deficit by nextyear will require tough decisions, notably on spending." Hungary needs the IMF/EU safety net to keep the trust ofinvestors from whom it borrows. But the country remainsvulnerable due to its high public debt, which is equal to 80percent of GDP, and its strong reliance on foreign financing. "If we do not have the safety net of international lenders,that hits us where it hurts most," said MKB Bank analyst ZsoltKondrat.  "One would definitely expect a weakening forint on Monday. A10-forint weakening (versus the euro) is quite plausible, andnobody knows how nervous the market's reaction might be." The forint traded at around 282 to the euro on Friday. Neighbouring Romania had to take tough steps last month tosecure the release of its IMF aid and reassure investors.
