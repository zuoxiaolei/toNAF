<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The U.S. dollar rose to a five-week high against its Canadian counterpart on Wednesday, as concerns over the deepening crisis in the euro zone and lackluster U.S. data clouded the outlook for riskier assets.USD/CAD hit 1.0454 during early U.S. trade, the pair’s highest since October 6; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.0435, gaining 0.51%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.0345, Tuesday’s low and resistance at 1.0570, the high of October 6.Earlier in the day, official data showed that new orders for a range of long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods unexpectedly rose in October, but the previous month’s number was revised down sharply.The Commerce Department said durable goods orders, excluding transportation rose 0.7% after a downwardly revised 0.6% increase in September. Analysts had expected the number to remain unchanged from the previously reported 1.8% increase.Overall orders fell 0.7% after declining 1.5% in September.In a separate report, the Labor Department said number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week rose unexpectedly, climbing to a seasonally adjusted 393,000, confounding expectations for a decline to 390,000.In the euro zone, Germany’s Treasury auctioned just EUR3.64 billion of 10-year government bonds with the average yield set at 1.98% earlier. Total bids for German debt fell short of the maximum amount available by 35%, the worst demand on record.The Canadian dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/CAD shedding 0.31% to hit 1.3978.Also Wednesday, U.S. data showed that consumer spending edged up 0.1% in October, slowing sharply from a revised 0.7% increase the previous month.             ]]></raw>
