<raw><![CDATA[ GYEONGJU, South Korea, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Finance officialsfrom the Group of 20 leading economies are unlikely to reach anyaccord committing them to abstain from currency devaluation andto caps on current account balances, a G20 source said onThursday. The source said talk of such commitments being made at thisweek's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers hadpossibly leaked from a working paper circulated by some of thedeveloped nations. But the proposal was not finding much favour with India,China and other emerging economies or even Germany, which has alarge current account surplus, the source, who has directknowledge of deliberations at the meeting, said.  G20 finance officials start their formal meetings on Friday,against a backdrop of policy discord and disparate agendas on howbest global trade and growth imbalances can be rectified. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner mooted the idea ofsome sort of norms being agreed on currencies in an interviewwith the Wall Street Journal. Separately, there was speculationcountries would be asked to commit to limits on current accountbalances. "It's a position paper of the U.S. and some other countrieswhich they have converted into a working paper. The actualdrafting of the communique will only begin Friday night afterfirst round of meetings between the finance ministers and centralbank governors," the source said. The final communique would make a rather "subdued" referenceto currencies and current account balances," he said. He said India, Germany and some other countries had told theUnited States on Thursday that there was no point in settingartificial caps on the current account balances. "We have also opposed any kind of what they are saying shouldbe 'global fx norms'. Rather we as in the emerging economiesincluding India, China as well as Germany have suggested thatthere should be structural reforms and currency and currentaccount balance issues should be corrected as part of the reformspackage. "If the US persists with that line, we will oppose it," thesource said. (Reporting by Abhijit Neogy; Editing by Vidya Ranganathan)             ]]></raw>
