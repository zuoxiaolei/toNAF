<raw><![CDATA[ * Mantega agrees to stay on at Rousseff's request - source * Official announcement may not come for a few days * Rousseff may ask central bank chief to stay on initially  (Adds details on Mantega in paragraphs 9-10) BRASILIA, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Brazilian Finance MinisterGuido Mantega accepted an invitation by president-elect DilmaRousseff to stay on as finance minister, a source with directknowledge of the decision told Reuters on Thursday. Rousseff's decision to keep Mantega would be the latestsign that she does not intend to stray far from the economicpolicies of her predecessor and political benefactor PresidentLuiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who leaves office on Jan. 1. Those policies have helped Brazil enjoy its biggesteconomic boom in almost three decades while also boosting thecountry's clout in global forums such as the G20 group, whereMantega has emerged as an influential voice. The choice dovetails with widespread speculation infinancial markets and political circles that Rousseff wouldleave Mantega in his post as a way of easing concerns amonginvestors worried about any abrupt changes in economic policy. But even if there is no changing of the guard at thefinance ministry, some analysts believe that Rousseff will lookto put her own stamp on economic policy and that some changesmay be on the horizon. "Continuity of people doesn't necessarily mean continuityof policies. And the continuation of the current policies isnot enough to take Brazil to the next stage," said PabloGoldberg, a strategist with HSBC in New York. Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported on Thursday thatRousseff is also weighing asking Henrique Meirelles to stay ontemporarily and that she will likely wait to announce hereconomic team until she picks someone for the central bank. Both the finance ministry and the central bank declined tocomment. The choice of Mantega may have been a missed opportunityfor Rousseff to appoint a more fiscally credible person in thefinance ministry, analysts said. The government's expansionaryfiscal policy during an election year in 2010 has come undercriticism, pressuring public accounts despite a rebound in taxrevenues. Mantega, a close Lula lieutenant who advised him oneconomic policy from 1993 to 2002, is known for advocatingincreased development spending in Brazil. Before his post asfinance minister, he worked as the planning minister and as thehead of state development BNDES. Lula has reportedly lobbied on the behalf of Mantega andMeirelles, arguing that it would help ensure a smoothtransition period at a time of global economic uncertainty. Speculation over Rousseff's possible cabinet has been rifeas investors look for reassurances that the new administrationwill rein in public spending and move ahead with long-soughtstructural reforms aimed at ensuring the economy can keepgrowing at a fast pace.

CURRENCY WOES AWAIT Mantega, 61, has overseen Brazil's economic boom in recentyears, with the economy now growing at robust rates that makeit the envy of many still-struggling developed nations. Throughout his more than four years as finance minister,Mantega has clashed with the central bank over the level ofBrazil's interest rate and confounded analysts and investorswith a more interventionist stance on the economy that waschampioned by many in the ruling Workers' Party. He has also presided over a steep increase in governmentspending and a deterioration of public finances, prompting someinvestors to wonder if he is committed to the fiscal disciplineand economic reforms that many say Brazil needs to sustain itsbrisk expansion. "Mantega is not the same combative minister who in 2006took office and clashed right away with the central bank. Hehas learned and is more mature, and could give markets asurprise," said Jose Francisco Lima Goncalves, chief economistat Banco Fator in Sao Paulo. "My perception is that he is conscious of the need for someprudence in the fiscal area," he added. "Mantega won't open thefaucets as he did during this election year." A well-placed official in Rousseff's Workers' Party toldReuters she plans to officially announce her choice for financeminister by the end of the month. The rest of the cabinet wouldlikely be unveiled by Dec. 15, the source added. Record-low interest rates in the United States, Japan andother developed economies have caused an avalanche of dollarsinto emerging economies like Brazil, propping up currencieslike the Brazilian real  and causing what Mantega dubbedan "international currency war." Frustrated with the flow of hot money into Brazil, Mantegaraised taxes on capital inflows and lambasted the U.S. FederalReserve's new quantitative easing policy, calling it dubious. Meirelles faces more resistance within the Workers' Partythan Mantega, meaning the chances of a change at the centralbank are greater than in the finance ministry, said the partysource, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
