<raw><![CDATA[ * Public support for widespread strikes seen limited * Greece, Italy most likely to see most labour turmoil * Coordinated Europe-wide union action seen unlikely  By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - European trade unions are facingup to a difficult choice: acquiesce to austerity measures andinfuriate members, or fight them with strikes and risk a marketbacklash that could make the economic situation worse. At one extreme is Ireland, where unions have avoidedwidespread industrial action over existing cuts -- some of theearliest and sharpest in Western Europe -- in part because theresulting market reaction would hurt workers more. Trade union congress leader Jack O'Connor told Reuters lastweek that he feared foreign investors would interpret seriousstrikes as a sign Ireland might not be able to push through cutsand meet debt obligations, leaving it unable to borrow. "Even if you win (the strike campaign), you could end uplosing," he said -- but he said the decision was costing himsleepless nights and would not rule out further strikes if thegovernment pushed through new cuts. At the other extreme is Greece -- where the European Unionand International Monetary Fund (IMF) are demanding harshspending cuts -- where unions say they will strike in June andpush for Europe-wide action against austerity measures. "We'll be pushing until the end to prevent the worst," GSEEunion head Yannis Panagopoulos, promising maximum resistance toa bill that raises the retirement age and curtails earlypensions. Panagopoulos says he is already talking to other Europeanunions and hopes they can work together to hold back a wave ofausterity measures as governments pull back on stimulus spendingand start to address deficits. [ID:nLDE64Q0S6] An increasing number of European countries are announcingausterity measures to placate nervous bond markets. Spain,Portugal, Britain, Italy, Holland and France all announced newsteps in recent weeks. [ID:nnLDE64Q1OF]  EUROPE-WIDE ACTION UNLIKELY Unions have tended to respond with open hostility,complaining the poor and public sector workers are being made topay the cost of the mistakes of the rich.  Italian unions say they will strike in June, while Spanishunions have threatened action if labour laws are changed withouttheir consent. Europe's unions will hold a scheduled quarterly meeting inBrussels on June 1. But with electorates in northern Europe inparticular already angry over having to bail out Greece, few seeany real prospect of a concerted campaign of solidarity. "It's hard to see this really bringing the masses onto thestreets in Liverpool or Lubeck," said David Lea, Western Europeanalyst at Control Risks. "The Irish example is veryinstructive. There is a lot of soul-searching going on withinunions and the emergence of the bond market as a politicalarbiter is weighing on their minds more than they might admit." The widespread market alarm -- hitting not just Greek debtbut also the euro -- that followed protests in Athens that ledto violence and the death of three in a burning bank is seen asa warning. "The Irish unions have it right," said Elizabeth Stephens,head of credit and political risk at London insurance brokerJardine Lloyd Thompson.  "My worry would be that the Greek unions may win in theshort term and prompt an end to the measures but the crisis ofconfidence that would produce could lead to default. Theeconomic damage would mean the unions would not stay powerfulfor long." A Greek march last week drew only half the crowd seen in the May 5 protests, while in France the government signalled itwould push ahead with plans to raise the pension age after weakprotests. [ID:nLDE64R0F8]  PUBLIC SUPPORT LIMITED "The public support just isn't there," said Control Risks'Lea. "The unions will need to take some action to avoidaccusations of irrelevance but it will be limited." A Europe-wide day of protest -- probably not explicitly tiedto Greece -- is possible, analysts say, but would likely only beobserved by more leftist unionists with turnout perhapsstrongest in Italy but weaker elsewhere. After Greece, Italy is seen as probably the next mostvulnerable country to labour unrest with unions already atloggerheads with Silvio Berlusconi's government -- althoughunions there tend to strike for hours rather than days, reducingboth the impact and market alarm. Spain's unions are seen likely to protest but ultimatelyacquiesce to cuts, as are Portugal's "In Spain, the unions know that at the end of the day ifthey bring down the leftist government the right will get backin," said Exclusive Analysis analyst Pepe Egger. In Britain, trade union UNITE is locked in a row withBritish Airways but analysts say the labour movement will likelytake a less aggressive line against austerity measures from anewly elected coalition government. "The British Airways case is really a one-off," said ControlRisks' Lea."Again, It just comes down to public support." Even Greek union boss Panagopoulos concedes culturaldifferences across Europe make coordinated action hard. "Scandinavians act differently and think southern Europeansact strangely, central Europeans also have a different way," hesaid. "It is very difficult."
