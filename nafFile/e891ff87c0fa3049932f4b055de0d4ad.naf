<raw><![CDATA[© Reuters.  Dollar edges lower on downbeat U.S. data, more reports on tapInvesting.com - The U.S. dollar was lower against the euro and the yen on Friday, as the previous session's downbeat U.S. data dampened optimism over the strength of the economy and as investors eyed additional U.S. economic reports due later in the day.EUR/USD edged up 0.14% to trade at 1.0992. The dollar was hit after the Commerce Department reported on Thursday that U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 1.5% in the three months to September, missing expectations for growth of 1.6%. In addition, the U.S. National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index dropped 2.3% last month, disappointing expectations for a gain of 1.0%.The greenback had strengthened broadly after Wednesday’s Federal Reserve statement said that officials might make a decision to raise interest rates at their December meeting.Elsewhere, market participants were eyeing the release of euro zone inflation data due later in the day.USD/JPY slid 0.30% to trade at 120.76.The yen gained ground after the Bank of Japan refrained from adding additional monetary easing measures at its monthly policy meeting on Friday.Also Friday, data showed that household spending in Japan declined by 1.3% in September, confounding expectations for a 0.3% gain.A separate report showed that Japan's consumer price index was flat in September, on a year-on-year basis, compared to expectations for an uptick of 0.1%.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.15% at 97.22, still close to Wednesday's two-and-a-half month highs of 97.89.             ]]></raw>
