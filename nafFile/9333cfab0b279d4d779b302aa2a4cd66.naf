<raw><![CDATA[ By Chris Buckley BEIJING, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Senior Chinese military officershave proposed that their country boost defence spending, adjustPLA deployments, and possibly sell some U.S. bonds to punishWashington for its latest round of arms sales to Taiwan. The calls for broad retaliation over the planned U.S.weapons sales to the disputed island came from officers atChina's National Defence University and Academy of MilitarySciences, interviewed by Outlook Weekly, a Chinese-languagemagazine published by the official Xinhua news agency. The interviews with Major Generals Zhu Chenghu and Luo Yuanand Senior Colonel Ke Chunqiao appeared in the issue publishedon Monday. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) plays no role in settingpolicy for China's foreign exchange holdings. Officials incharge of that area have given no sign of any moves to sellU.S. Treasury bonds over the weapons sales, a move that couldalarm markets and damage the value of China's own holdings. While far from representing fixed government policy, theopen demands for retaliation by the PLA officers underscoredthe domestic pressures on Beijing to deliver on its threats topunish the Obama administration over the arms sales. "Our retaliation should not be restricted to merelymilitary matters, and we should adopt a strategic package ofcounter-punches covering politics, military affairs, diplomacyand economics to treat both the symptoms and root cause of thisdisease," said Luo Yuan, a researcher at the Academy ofMilitary Sciences. "Just like two people rowing a boat, if the United Statesfirst throws the strokes into chaos, then so must we." Luo said Beijing could "attack by oblique means andstealthy feints" to make its point in Washington. "For example, we could sanction them using economic means,such as dumping some U.S. government bonds," Luo said. The warnings from the PLA come after weeks of strainsbetween Washington and Beijing, who have also been at odds overInternet controls and hacking, trade and currency quarrels, andPresident Barack Obama's planned meeting with the Dalai Lama,the exiled Tibetan leader reviled by China as a "separatist."
