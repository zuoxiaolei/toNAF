<raw><![CDATA[* Sterling cedes ground vs rebounding dollar * Asian central banks, real money accounts buy pound (Adds details about flows, updates prices)  LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Sterling fell against a broadlyfirmer U.S. dollar on Monday but hovered near seven-week highsagainst the struggling euro as uncertainty over whether Irelandwould require emergency funding hurt the single currency. The dollar extended its gains from last week, buoyed by asharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields and a report that a group ofprominent Republican-leaning economists was launching a campaigncalling on the Federal Reserve to drop its quantitative easingplan. The dollar index hit a six-week high while the 10-year U.S.Treasury yield rose to its highest in two months and thefive-year yield rose more than 10 basis points. This helped the greenback and drove sterling 0.5 percentlower for the day to $1.6055. Sterling had fallen as low as$1.6042, with traders citing stop-loss orders triggered at$1.6060 and at $1.6050. Traders said Russian speculators sold cable, while buying byAsian central banks and real money accounts tempered theselosses. "Cable is under pressure because of the rising U.S. dollar,which is getting support from rising yields," said AdrianSchmidt, FX strategist at Lloyds TSB Financial Markets. "We seea fair bit of resistance at $1.6150/80 levels." The pound hit an intra-day high of $1.6185 on Nov. 12 and apeak of $1.6183 on Nov. 9 before retreating, indicating it wasstruggling to break that area convincingly. A raft of UK economic numbers is due this week along withthe minutes of the Bank of England monetary policy meeting forNovember. Analysts will scour the minutes for clues about thelikelihood and timing of any further asset purchases. Recent UK data has surprised to the upside, lessening thelikelihood of more easing in the near term. Inflation numbers onTuesday and jobs data on Wednesday should make it clearerwhether the economy needs a further dose of stimulus. The pound should then be well-supported against thestruggling euro, traders said. The euro was marginally lower against the pound at 84.80pence, close to a seven-week low of 84.50 pence struck onFriday. It fell as low as 84.64 with stops at 84.65 triggered,dealers said. Traders said there was good support for the euro around84.50, close to its 100-day moving average that comes in at84.54 on Monday. The euro was subdued at $1.3630, giving up earlier gainsmade on hopes of an EU aid package for Ireland. Media reports onMonday said Ireland was considering asking for money for itsbanks from the EU's emergency fund in a bid to fend off thethreat of a bailout for the state. EU sources told Reuters over the past two days that talk ofa possible bailout were under way and that Ireland, with itsborrowing costs rising, was unlikely to hold out. "The single currency is finding a degree of support around0.8450," said Michael Hewson, market analyst at CMC Markets."Pullbacks should remain limited to around the 200-day movingaverage around 0.8580, and at the very most 0.8620."
