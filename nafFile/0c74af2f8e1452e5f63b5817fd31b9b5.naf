<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar extended losses against the euro on Wednesday after unexpectedly strong German industrial output data fuelled optimism over the outlook for the euro zoneâ€™s largest economy.During European afternoon trade, the dollar hit session lows against the euro, with EUR/USD advancing 0.66% to 1.3164.Official data showed that German industrial output jumped 1.2% in March, the largest increase in 12 months and confounding expectations for a 0.1% decline. Industrial production was 2.5% lower compared to a year earlier in March, better than expectations for a 3.8% decline.The data came one day after a report showed that German factory orders also beat expectations in March, rising 2.2%, the fastest rate of growth since October 2012.Sentiment on the euro remained fragile amid speculation over another rate cut by the European Central Bank after President Mario Draghi said Monday the bank was ready to act if needed.The dollar was slightly lower against the yen, with USD/JPY sliding 0.15% to 98.84.The dollar was lower against the pound and the Swiss franc, with GBP/USD rising 0.20% to 1.5515 and USD/CHF shedding 0.40% to trade at 0.9363.The Swiss franc showed little reaction after official data showed that consumer prices in Switzerland fell 0.6% from a year earlier in April, compared to expectations for a 0.5% decline.The greenback was mixed against its Australian, New Zealand and Canadian counterparts, with AUD/USD climbing 0.18% to 1.0200, NZD/USD dropping 0.57% to 0.8408 and USD/CAD dipping 0.02% to 1.0043.The Australian dollar firmed up following better-than-expected Chinese trade data, after falling sharply on Tuesday when the Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates to a record low 2.75%.The New Zealand dollar fell to session lows earlier after Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler said the bank had intervened in markets to try to stem the appreciation of the currency.The Canadian dollar was almost unchanged after official data showed that Canadian building starts fell in line with expectations in April, dropping to 174,900 units from 181,100 units in March.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.52% to 81.94.              ]]></raw>
