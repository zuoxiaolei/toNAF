<raw><![CDATA[ * Big manufacturers' sentiment DI at plus 1 vs March minus 14 * Big firms expect 4.4 pct capex rise in year to March 2011 By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto TOKYO, July 1 (Reuters) - The mood among Japanese businessesturned positive for the first time in two years and big firmsrevised up capital spending plans, a Bank of Japan survey showed,in a sign the export-driven economic recovery is taking hold. The survey for the three months to June showed Europe'ssovereign debt woes and the sharp appreciation in the yen thatfollowed have not yet taken a toll as Japanese companies benefitfrom solid exports to Asia. "Overall, the tankan survey shows better corporate sentiment,especially among big manufacturers, who have raised theiroutlook, but it still leaves some elements of concern. The surveydoes not paint an entirely optimistic view for the economy," saidAyako Sera, a market strategist at Sumitomo Trust & Banking. The headline index measuring big manufacturers' sentimentimproved 15 points to plus 1 in June, the BOJ's closely watchedtankan quarterly survey showed on Thursday. That was higher thana median market forecast of minus 4 and was the fifth consecutivequarter of improvement. The index for September was seen at plus 3, showing firmsexpect conditions to improve further over the next three months. In a sign the recovery was broadening, the survey showed bigfirms expect to increase capital spending by 4.4 percent for theyear that started in April. While that was smaller than the 4.9 percent rise forecast byeconomists, it was an improvement over the previous tankan thatshowed companies planned to cut spending by 0.4 percent. In theprevious year that ended in March, big firms cut capital spendingby 17 percent. Japan's first-quarter economic growth outpaced that of theUnited States and Europe on solid exports to Asia. The rebound inexports has led to a bottoming out in capital spending. But falling shipments and rising inventory in May signalledthe benefits of a rebound in exports may be moderating. Analystssay growth will likely slow this year as the impact of subsidieson energy-efficient goods fades. The sentiment indexes are derived by subtracting thepercentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from thosewho say they are good. Negative readings mean pessimistsoutnumber optimists.
