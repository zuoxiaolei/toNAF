<raw><![CDATA[ * Jan. 24 rate hike supported by all 4 cenbank officials * Forex intervention "essential, should continue" * Housing prices likely to gain further in 2011 * Global economy improving   (Adds details, comments) By Steven Scheer JERUSALEM, Feb 7 (Reuters) - The Bank of Israel has decidedthat it would continue a nearly three-year policy of buyingforeign currency to keep the shekel  from appreciatingrapidly, minutes of a Jan. 24 rates decision showed on Monday. In the meeting that ended with a quarter-point increase inthe benchmark rate  to 2.25 percent, the questioncame up whether there was a need for intervention in the foreignexchange market, and if so, what degree was required. "Discussion focused particularly on how much flexibility theexchange rate should be allowed, and the implications of variousscenarios on the trade balance and on capital flows. It wasagreed that in light of the developments on the real side during2010, the Bank of Israel's policy ... was still essential andshould continue," the minutes said. The central bank started intervening in the market in March2008 with $25 million a day, a level that rose to $100 millionfour months later. Since August 2009, intervention has been ondays the Bank of Israel deems necessary. It bought $2.085 billion of foreign currency in Januaryafter buying $1.815 billion in December. The Bank of Israel, which  has made slowing the shekel'srise central to its monetary policy, has bought tens of billionsof dollars over the past three years but the Israeli currencyhas stayed strong, partly due to a wide interest rates gap withthe United States and Europe -- Israel's main trading partners. Some officials expressed fears of a further appreciation ofthe shekel should the central bank raise rates. But new centralbank directives [ID:nLDE70J1KN] aimed at moderating the effectsof wider interest rate differentials on the shekel allowed therate hike to proceed, the minutes said. Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer's decision to raisethe key rate was supported by all four central bank officials.The increase was the first such move in four months and theseventh time since August 2009. The current interest rate isdeemed expansionary, the bank said.  INFLATION Inflation, according to the bond market and economists, isexpected to remain at 3 percent or above for most of 2011,higher than an annual target of 1-3 percent. That, the minutessaid, "indicate the need for an increase in the interest rate." Israel had inflation 2.7 percent in 2010, much of thatstemming from gains in housing costs, an issue that was a majorchallenge for the central bank last year. House prices rose 17 percent in 2010 as low interest ratesled to a rapid expansion of housing credit, while housing demandoutpaced supply. Central bank officials agreed "there was asignificant probability that housing prices would continue theirrapid rate of increase in the coming year". In addition to interest rate hikes, the Bank of Israel hasalready taken a number of steps aimed at raising banks' mortgageloan rates. Policymakers said they would introduce furthermeasures "if there was no change in the path of prices and inthe degree of leverage". Also supporting a rate increase last month was Israel's"substantial expansion" of the economy and employment levels.After growing 4.5 percent in 2010, the central bank sees stronggrowth continuing in the first quarter of 2011, which wouldboost inflation, the minutes said. "It was also noted that the most recent data indicate morepositive assessments of the recovery of the global economy fromthe economic crisis," the central bank said.
