<raw><![CDATA[ BRUSSELS, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Euro zone retail sales fell lessthan expected month-on-month in August as a rebound in the foodsector lent support, data showed, in a signal consumer demandmay be benefitting from a nascent economic recovery. Retail sales in the 16-country area fell 0.2 percent againstJuly and dropped 2.6 percent year-on-year, European Unionstatistics office Eurostat said on Monday.  Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.5 percent fallversus the previous month, while the annual decrease came inline with their forecasts. The data comes as the European Central Bank is expected tokeep its main interest rate at 1.0 percent this week amid signsthe worst European recession since World War Two may be ending. Analysts expect the euro zone's economy to have startedgrowing in the third quarter of 2009 after it contracted by 0.1percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period. But expansion is likely to be limited due to growingunemployment, which hit a 10-year high in August at 9.6 percent. Economists say retail sales figures have been affected bygovernment cash incentives to change old cars for new ones. Those payouts may have diverted household funds fromsmaller-ticket items, negatively affecting retail sales, whichdo not include car purchases. The car-scrapping programmes are now coming to an end, withGermany having wrapped up its own on Sept. 2. Eurostat said sales of food, drinks and tobacco increased by0.5 percent against July after falling for three months in arow. In annual terms, they dropped 1.3 percent. Non-food products fell 0.6 percent and 3.2 percentrespectively. In Spain, among the hardest-hit by the crisis in the eurozone, monthly sales rebounded by 1.4 percent. In Germany, theeuro zone's biggest economy, sales fell 1.5 percent. In the whole 27-country European Union, retail sales fell0.3 percent on the month and 1.8 percent year-on-year.
