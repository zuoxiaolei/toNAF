<raw><![CDATA[ * IMF agrees to Romanian budget gap of 7.3 pct/GDP in 2009 * Romanian GDP seen contracting by 8-8.5 pct in 2009  (Releads with European Commission, adds details) By Luiza Ilie and Marius Zaharia BUCHAREST, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fundand the European Commission have allowed Romania to raise itsbudget deficit target this year and next to prevent furtherdeepening recession through fiscal austerity. Following its first review of Romania's performance under a20 billion euro aid deal it led in March, the IMF also doubledits forecast for economic contraction this year to more than 8percent, from the 4.1 percent it had expected in March. The changes underscored deepening economic woes in Romania,where the global credit slump has decimated domesticconsumption, a key driver of the economy in recent years. "We do not want to make the economic situation worse byoverly tightening fiscal policy," mission chief Jeffrey Frankstold a news conference on Monday. Pending approval from the IMF's board in coming weeks,Romania will be able to run a deficit of 7.3 percent of grossdomestic product (GDP) from the original plan of 4.6 percent.Next year, it has to bring it down to less than 6 percent.  Under EU accounting rules the deficit will amount to 7.8percent this year. The increase follows a similar agreement with Hungary whichhas sought leniency from the Fund to avoid further austeritymeasures. Bucharest will still have to cut spending by an additional0.8 percent of gross domestic product to meet the new goal, butanalysts said the target is broadly realistic. It also has to overhaul public finances to make spendingmore transparent and, in the long term, lower, particularly onadministration salaries. Additional requirements attached to the loan package alongwith the deficit increase include measures to strengthen fiscaldiscipline in local governments, decentralised entities andstate-owned enterprises, said the European Commission, the EU'sexecutive arm. However, analysts warned lenders may be too optimistic inexpectations of future fiscal reforms in Romania, where theruling coalition is riven by policy differences ahead of apresidential election later this year.  WISHFUL THINKING? IMF mission chief Franks said the Fund was still"ambitious", not "lenient," taking into account Romania'splummeting economy and that he saw broad support for fiscalreforms among political parties. His comments came in stark contrast with governmentcoalition quarrels over the weekend when the ruling coalition'sSocial Democrats accused the Democrat-Liberal Prime Minister oftrying to bypass public debates over fiscal reforms. "The IMF seems to be quite purposefully naive about political support in the receiving countries for budget cuts,that goes for Latvia as well as Romania," said Lars Christensenof Danske Bank in Copenhagen. Following the disbursement of the second loan tranche inSeptember, Romania has to show significant progress insimplifying public pay policies, a difficult issue ahead of thepresidential poll. The public sector employs a third of Romania's workforce andhas seen massive pay hikes over the last four years. "There is always electoral risk," said David Oxley, emergingEurope economist at Capital Economics in London. The Fund said expectations for more severe contraction thisyear reflected worse than expected performance in the firstquarter rather than expectations of further deepening in thesecond half. It forecast the economy turning to modest growth in2010.  (Additional reporting by Jan Strupczewski in Brussels) (Writing by Justyna Pawlak; editing by Ron Askew)             ]]></raw>
