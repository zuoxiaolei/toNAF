<raw><![CDATA[ By Isabel Versiani and Pedro da Costa WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) - Brazilian Finance Ministersaid on Thursday he will push for tougher oversight ofderivatives at this weekend's gathering of major worldeconomies, blaming speculation for a run-up in commodityprices. In an interview with Reuters, Mantega took a decidedlyfriendlier tone toward China despite what is widely seen asBrazil's disadvantage in exports market due to a lack offlexibility in the Chinese yuan. "The primary responsibility for the excess liquidity lieswith the advanced nations, not emerging ones," he said inresponse to questions about China's exchange rate, which manyeconomists say is artificially undervalued. "Emerging countriesare helping because they are pushing the international economy.So China contributes, Brazil contributes, Russia, India." That was a shift from the minister, who is now workingunder a new president, Dilma Rousseff. She took over from thepopular Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva at the start of this year.The comments suggest the United States may be losing animportant ally in the fight against what it sees as the unfairadvantage China gains from pegging its exchange rate to thedollar.
