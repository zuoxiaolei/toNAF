<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro hits 5-mth high of $1.4269, runs into resistance * Single currency makes brief show above 120 yen * Diverging rate expectations may be fully priced (Changes dateline, adds quotes, detail, previous TOKYO) By Neal Armstrong LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - The euro slipped back from11-month highs against the yen on Monday and a five-month peakagainst the dollar, as analysts said expectations for highereuro zone interest rates were becoming priced in. The Bank of Japan is likely to downgrade its economicassessment on Wednesday, while comments from a Federal Reserveofficial on Friday highlighted uncertainty over the need totighten monetary policy in the United States. Markets expect the European Central Bank to raise interestrates by 25 basis points from a record low on Thursday, with afurther two hikes factored in by year-end. The euro rose to $1.4269 against the dollar but stalledahead of its November 2010 high, seen as resistance around$1.4281. It later eased to $1.4230 to trade around flat on theday. "I think the euro is close to putting in a top now as themonetary policy divergence story is almost fully priced," saidLee Hardman, currency strategist at BTM-UFJ. Technical analysts also highlighted trendline resistancedrawn from the euro's record high struck in July 2008 coming inaround $1.4300. "The move wider in EUR/USD rate differentials seems to havelost some of its impetus in the run up to the ECB rate decisionindicating that some euro positives are already priced in by themarket." said Valentin Marinov, currency analyst at CitiFX in anote. The euro briefly popped above 120 yen for the first timesince May 2010 and last traded at 119.55 yen, down 0.1 percentfrom late U.S. trade on Friday. "The yen is likely to continue to gradually weaken but wesee more upside for dollar/yen rather than euro/yen. We thinkthe market is underestimating U.S. rate hike expectations," saidHardman at BTM-UFJ. One of the Federal Reserve's most powerful policymakers onFriday went against an increasingly hawkish tone from some otherFed officials worried about inflation, saying he saw no need forthe central bank to reverse course. William Dudley, president of the New York Federal ReserveBank, said the Fed was "still very far away" from achieving itsmandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability,even though the economy is on a firmer footing. The dollar was little changed versus a currency basket onMonday, trading around 75.786. Stronger-than-expected U.S.employment data on Friday, hinting at a stronger economicrecovery and the possibility for higher U.S. interest rates,leant the greenback some support.  AUSSIE BUOYANT The dollar was flat around 84.04 yen. It had hit a six-monthhigh of 84.735 yen on Friday on trading platform EBS, stallingahead of an option barrier at 84.75. Traders reported goodinterest to sell dollars into the 85.00 area. The dollar was up around 11 percent from its post-World WarTwo record low of 76.25 yen struck in March. It rose above its 200-day moving average at 83.57 last week,in a sign that its downtrend against the yen may have run itscourse, while a potential upside target lies at itsmid-September high of 85.94 yen. The yen hovered near recent lows on the crosses,particularly against higher yielding currencies like theAustralian dollar. The Aussie reached highs not seen since early May 2010 at87.69 yen, and was last at 87.25 yen, down 0.1 percent from lateU.S. trade on Friday. It has gained roughly 16 percent from alow hit on March 17. The Aussie also hit a fresh 29-year high against thegreenback, reaching $1.0422 after breaching a barrier at$1.0400, which triggered stop-loss buying. It eased back totrade flat for the day around 1.0400 in European dealing. (Additional reporting by Ian Chua and Masayuki Kitano,Editing by Toby Chopra)             ]]></raw>
