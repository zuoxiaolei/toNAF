<raw><![CDATA[ * Comments from officials on inflation push up bond yields * Food inflation 16.12 pct on June 5 vs 16.74 pct week ago * Tight cash conditions forestall early rate hike: traders * Traders say no rate rise until at least early July By Suvashree Dey Choudhury and Neha D'silva MUMBAI, June 17 (Reuters) - Indian policymakers said onThursday that they were concerned about soaring prices, movingbond yields off day lows as investors saw a greater chance ofan early interest rate hike despite a slight easing in food andfuel price inflation. Pressure has been mounting on the Reserve Bank of India(RBI) to raise rates ahead of a scheduled July 27 policy reviewafter the wholesale price index  rose 10.16 percentin May, the highest level in the G20 group of leadingeconomies. But a slew of sometimes contradictory comments fromgovernment officials and central bankers, and a cash squeeze inthe banking system, have kept the market jittery about possibletightening moves. Many traders expect the central bank will wait until atleast early July to raise rates. Most analysts still expect the RBI to wait until its lateJuly review, especially given tight cash conditions at Indianbanks. RBI Deputy Governor K.C. Chakrabarty said on Thursday thatdomestic inflation is a bigger concern than other globalfactors [ID:nSGE65G07J], and C. Rangarajan, economic adviser tothe prime minister, called inflation levels "uncomfortable"[ID:nSGE65G07V] Chakrabarty is not directly involved in monetary policy asother members of board. Rangarajan is seen as having the ear ofPrime Minister Mammohan Singh but has little direct influenceover monetary policy. Another RBI deputy governor, Subir Gokarn, who as in chargeof monetary policy is seen as an influential member of theboard, signalled on Wednesday the bank would continue totighten but warned against overreacting amid global economicuncertainties, such as Europe's debt crisis. [ID:nSGE65F04L] The 10-year benchmark bond yield  reboundedto 7.6 percent after the officials' comments on Thursday. Ithad earlier fallen to 7.54 percent after the central bankannounced it would buy back 200 billion Indian rupees ($4.3billion) of bonds to help ease a temporary cash shortage.[ID:nSGE65F021] Cash has been tight in India since late May as about 1.36trillion rupees has flowed out of the banking system towardspayments for government 3G mobile spectrum and broadbandauctions, and for advance tax payments. The Indian banking system will face a shortfall of at least400 billion-450 billion rupees once payments for broadbandauctions are complete next week, traders estimated, adding thesituation will be clearer when the new reporting fortnightstarts Saturday. "Though people are calling for RBI action, I feel the RBIwill wait and gauge the inflation and liquidity situation forat least another couple of weeks before deciding on anyaction," said S. Srinivasaraghavan, treasury head at IDBIGilts. "Whatever action they take will only have a lag effect, andwe have to also keep in mind that previous monetary action hashad little impact on inflation as it is largely supply-sidedriven," he added. Inflation in India has remained stubbornly high, adding topressure on the central bank as well as the government, whichfears a rapid rise in interest rates could anger voters andderail the country's strong economic growth. Prime Minister Singh's coalition government has alreadyheld back on major economic reforms such as freeing up retailfuel prices ahead of eight state elections due later in 2010and 2011. Government data on Thursday showed India's food price indexrose 16.12 percent in the year to June 5, though the rate ofgrowth eased from the previous week's annual reading of 16.74percent. The fuel price index climbed 13.18 percent, compared withan annual rise of 14.23 percent in the previous week. JITTERS PERSIST Policymakers and advisers have said inflation is expectedto ease in the coming months on lower food prices and normalmonsoon rains, but their comments have been off the mark in thepast. "It won't be prudent on the part of the RBI to hike ratesat least in June because you have these liquidity issues," saidJay Shankar, an economist at Religare Capital. Singh expects the inflation rate to moderate to 5-6 percentby December. The RBI has raised rates twice, by a total of 50 basispoints, since mid-March to curb price pressures and is expectedto deliver another hike of 25 basis points at the July review.The markets have already priced in such a move. Central banks in the region such as those in Australia andMalaysia have started raising rates as growth rebounds from theglobal slowdown. But some Asian banks have paused in theirtightening to see if the euro zone's debt crisis willjeopardise the global economic recovery.
