<raw><![CDATA[ April 8 (Reuters) -    * IMF could turn to markets toraise  additional resources 	 * Step may be useful in times of global market stress	 * Well-funded IMF important for global confidence	  WASHINGTON, April 7 (Reuters) - The International MonetaryFund said on Thursday it was worth exploring ways that theglobal institution could borrow from financial markets at shortnotice to raise additional funding for its lending programs.	 In a paper that looks at progress by the Group of 20 majoreconomies in reforming the global monetary system, the Fund saidbuilding confidence in the IMF's ability to respond to crisesmay warrant looking at alternative ways of fund-raising,including turning to markets.	 The G20 meets in Washington next week before semi-annualmeetings of the IMF and World Bank where changes to the globalmonetary system will be discussed by finance ministers.	 "A more secure and flexible global safety net might requiremobilization of additional resources," the IMF said.	 "This could have the added advantage of offering a relativesafe haven asset during times of global market stress," itadded.	 The IMF boosted its resources in 2009-10 by turning tomember countries for loans or by raising members' subscriptionsthrough so-called quota increases. But the IMF paper noted thatthe process took time and may not always be politicallyfeasible.	 The IMF's largest contributors are facing rising publicdebts and slashing budgets at home to try to balance theirbudgets, making it politically difficult to make the argument tovoters to lend to international financial institutions.	 The IMF was called on recently to provide rescue loansalongside the European Union to Ireland and Greece as they facedmarket pressures to fix problems in their economies.	 On Wednesday, Portugal indicated it was next to ask forfinancial help after its borrowing costs rose to unsustainablelevels.	  NEW ROLE FOR SDR	 Among issues being explored to update the global monetarysystem is whether or not to include the Chinese renminbi in abasket of currencies that make up the IMF's special drawingrights -- an international reserve asset of the IMF.	 The basket is currently made up of the dollar, euro, poundsterling and the yen. Created in 1969, it does not reflect therising importance of China.	 One of the biggest obstacles to the SDR playing a biggerrole in the global financial system was technical challenges anda "great deal of consensus-building and policy coordination,"the IMF report said.	 The report said most of the ideas being considered to remakethe global monetary system would require more collaborationamong countries. In addition, some proposals would take time toimplement, the report said, suggesting it could be a whilebefore a new monetary system is rolled out.
