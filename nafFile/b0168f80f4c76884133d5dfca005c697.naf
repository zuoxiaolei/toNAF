<raw><![CDATA[ * ECB extends easier rules for collateral into 2011 * Decision major boon for Greece, Greek banks * Changing collateral rules lessens investor doubts  FRANKFURT, March 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank'sdecision to extend its looser collateral rules offers a majorreprieve to Greece, ditching the guillotine hanging over thecountry should it suffer another ratings downgrade. The ECB lowered its threshold for accepting debt ascollateral during the crisis to BBB-, meaning at least oneagency must rate debt at this level for it to be eligible, butthe threshold had been due to go back to A- at year-end. Rating agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor's have downgradedGreece into 'B' territory and if Moody's had followed suit,commercial banks would no longer have been able to exchangeGreek government debt for cash in ECB refinancing operationsfrom January 2011. In a concession to Greece, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichetsaid on Thursday the ECB would extend its BBB- threshold into2011, coupled with a new scale of risk margins. "It shows that they realised the current rules were aDamocles sword hanging over Greece," said Juergen Michels,economist at Citi in London. "It is really important they made this statement today tocalm markets that are worried about the Greek situation."

It gives a boost to Greek banks but also German and Frenchbanks, which also hold a lot of Greek sovereign bonds.  "When a central bank does not accept one country's bonds,that's a terrible signal for the markets," Nomura economistLaurent Bilke said. The premium investors demand to hold 10-year Greekgovernment bonds rather than benchmark German Bunds fell afterTrichet's announcement. [ID:nLDE62O0KU]  * HIGHER RISK MARGINS ECB Governing Council Axel Weber had flagged the idea ofcoupling a lower ratings threshold with higher risk margins, orhaircuts, in an interview with Reuters Insider televisionearlier this month. As an extra risk protection measure, when calculating howmuch a bank can borrow in exchange for some sorts of assets theECB does not take the full market value of the asset butsubtracts a percentage, known as a haircut. So a bank whichlodges debt with a market value of 100 million euros might onlyreceive 95 million in liquidity in exchange.  Trichet said the haircut schedule would be "graded", butgave no details how it would differ from the current slidingscale. The ECB's scale for assessing the riskiness of assets hassovereign bonds at one end and asset-backed securities at theother. The range of base haircuts goes from 0.5 percent to 20percent, with add-ons of as much as 10 percent. Bonds rated BBB-have an extra haircut of 5 percent, introduced at the same timeas the temporary relaxation in the collateral rules. ABS is notincluded in the relaxation.  * ACKNOWLEDGES SERIOUSNESS OF GREEK PROBLEMS The ECB had earlier this year rejected giving any "specialtreatment" to Greece, but after its March meeting said renewedtensions in some financial market segments were a downside riskto growth. "It looks like what they are saying is that there is a moreof systemic risk as a result of the Greek problems," saidMichael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.  * REDUCES RELIANCE ON RATINGS AGENCIES Policymakers including Ewald Nowotny have complained aboutthe power the current system gives to ratings agencies. "The fate of Greece, and if you are going to be moredramatic, the fate of Europe, depends on the judgement of onerating agency. That is an unacceptable situation," Nowotny said.[ID:nLDE6212BE]  "There was no other way out. You can't remain in asituation in which Moody's is the judge of the eligibility ofGreek bonds at the ECB, that was just unsustainable," said MarcoValli, economist at Unicredit.
