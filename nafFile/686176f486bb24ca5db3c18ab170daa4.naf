<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar traded flat to higher against most major currencies on Wednesday after the Bank of Canada left rates unchanged amid a rather dovish take on its economy, which sent investors snapping up dollar positions on sentiment the global economy still faces headwinds.Advances in U.S. stock markets capped the greenback's gains and sparked appetite for risk-on asset classes.In U.S. trading on Wednesday, EUR/USD was down 0.02% at 1.3319.The Bank of Canada kept interest rates unchanged at 1.0% in a widely expected decision, though the monetary authority's language left investors predicting that tightening would come later than they once expected.Canada's economy slowed more than expected in the second half of 2012, and going forward "economic activity is expected to be more restrained," the bank said in a statement."The economy is now forecast to return to full capacity in the second half of 2014," the bank added.Investors who were expecting tightening to come sooner, perhaps in the first half of this year, sought refuge in the U.S. greenback.Meanwhile in the U.S., uncertainty still remains over how lawmakers will come to an agreement to lift the government's USD16.4 trillion debt ceiling, which boosted the safe-harbor greenback's appeal.Republican leaders in the House of Representatives have said they intend to pass legislation that will give the government room to borrow for another three to four months, though fears political brinkmanship will return when the time comes to address longer-term spending reforms kept investors moving towards safe-haven greenback positions on Wednesday.Markets roiled in 2011 when the U.S. last approached its debt ceiling, as lawmakers waited until the last minutes to strike a deal to avoid default.The dollar came under pressure, however, as U.S. stock prices rose in earlier trading.Fourth-quarter earnings have come in better than expected for many companies in the U.S. which enticed market players off the sidelines and into stock markets on Wednesday, which was bearish for the dollar.The greenback, meanwhile, was down against the pound, with GBP/USD trading up 0.03% at 1.5843.The dollar dipped against the yen, with USD/JPY trading down 0.02% at 88.69 and was unchanged against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF trading at 0.9294.The dollar was mixed against its cousins in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with USD/CAD up 0.73% at 0.9992, AUD/USD down 0.18% at 1.0547 and NZD/USD trading up 0.02% at 0.8411.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.08% at 80.02.On Thursday, the U.S. is to publish private sector data on existing home sales, a leading indicator of economic health.             ]]></raw>
