Three weeks ago the bank said that the “deflationary risk in Switzerland has largely disappeared”, but added that if current “downside risks” from the turmoil in the EU materialize “via an appreciation of the Swiss Franc and lead to a renewed threat of deflation,” the SNB would “take all the measures necessary to ensure price stability”.Meanwhile, the Swiss franc was down against the euro, with EUR/CHF gaining 0.06% to hit 1.3357.Later Tuesday the U.S. was to produce a closely watched report on its services sector.              ]]></raw>
