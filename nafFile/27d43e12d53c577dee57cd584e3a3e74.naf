<raw><![CDATA[ By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Investors pulled back some oftheir exposure to equities in April, buying bonds and turning tosafe-haven cash amid worries that global economic growth couldfalter from its rapid pace, Reuters polls showed on Tuesday. Surveys of 56 leading investment houses in the UnitedStates, Europe ex-UK, Japan and Britain showed exposure tostocks falling to 51.3 percent in the month from 52.6 percent inMarch. [ASSET/WRAP] Bonds rose slightly to 34.6 percent from 34.0 while cash waslifted to 5.1 percent in a balanced portfolio from 4.7 percent amonth earlier. It was the highest exposure to cash -- where investors parkmoney in times of uncertainty -- since September, around thetime stock markets began rallying on prospects for renewed assetbuying by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Interviews with poll participants suggested a degree ofconcern has grown about the impact of a rising oil price ongrowth that may also be peaking. "We're moving into seasonally weak conditions (for equities)with May and June here, and the macro story may be at risk ifoil prices shoot to $130 per barrel or so. There are too manythings that can go wrong," said Keith Wirtz, chief investmentofficer at U.S. firm Fifth Third Asset Management. Investors are also facing uncertain times vis-a-vis interestrates, with the European Central Bank having already tightened,the Bank of England under pressure to follow suit and the Fedsignalling its $600 billion bond purchase programme will end,but offering a slightly more downbeat assessment of the U.S.economy. "The most uncertainty is probably about future economicpolicy ... a slowdown while policy is being tightened may beunnerving for investors used to three years of very easy policyconditions," said Chris Paine, associate director for assetallocation at Henderson Global Investors in London. Equity markets have also enjoyed a strong run, with the MSCIall-country world stock index  up around 16percent over the past 12 months and 37 percent from a 2010 low.Graphic on April poll findings: http://r.reuters.com/sys39rGraphic on asset returns in 2011 http://r.reuters.com/qes39rFor Reuters Insider show: http://link.reuters.com/wef39r^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  REGIONALLY U.S. fund managers slightly cut their exposure to equitiesin April and raised their allocation in bonds, booking someprofits after an impressive rally for equities.
