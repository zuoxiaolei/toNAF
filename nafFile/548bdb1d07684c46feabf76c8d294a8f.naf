<raw><![CDATA[ * Obama says world can ride out oil price spike * Markets: Main risk is if protests spread to big producers * Banks: oil prices near levels where growth threatened * Inflation pressures could accelerate tightening (Fixes word in paragraph 2.)	 By Jeff Mason and Amena Bakr	 WASHINGTON/RIYADH, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The world can weathera spike in oil prices, U.S. President Barack Obama said, asSaudi Arabia offered some respite to fears over Middle East oilsupplies by indicating it can cover export cuts resulting fromLibya's civil war.	 After a surge in Brent oil prices to 2-1/2 year highs near$120 a barrel, South Korea, the world's fifth-biggest crudeimporter, warned that its inflation situation was gettingtougher. 	 Business executives fretted about rising prices andinvestment banks said oil was reaching an inflection point thatcould endanger the world's recovery from the global financialcrisis.	 "We actually think that we'll be able to ride out the Libyasituation and it will stabilize," Obama, referring to fuelprices, told a group of corporate chief executives.	 His Treasury Secretary said the world had plenty of oilreserves. 	 "We have substantial capacity across the major economies inthe strategic reserves," Timothy Geithner said.	 "Hopefully, by reminding people of that and callingattention to the fact that there's a fair amount of excesscapacity in parts of OPEC ... hopefully that will make it lesslikely the market ... starts to build in higher prices overtime."	  The key risk for the world economy is a sustained rise inthe price of oil. But after shooting up to close to $120 abarrel in intraday trade on Thursday, Brent crude futures ended the day at less than $112, showing just howfraught investors nerves are.	 The sharp fall came after market rumours that Libyan leaderMuammar Gaddafi had been shot dead and on news that top producerSaudi Arabia could cover any supply disruptions. 	 On Friday, Brent crude was trading around $112. U.S. crudefutures eased to $97.60 from a Thursday high of $103.41.	 In Libya, forces loyal to Gaddafi hit back in fierce gunbattles with rebels holding towns near the capital but therewere no signs they had broken the opposition momentum.	 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)has an estimated 4-6 million barrels per day of spare crudeproduction capacity, more than enough on paper to cover Libya'soutput of 1.6 million barrels a day.	 But markets are worried that the unrest might spread tobigger producers in the region that would have a much biggerimpact on the world economy.	 After public uprisings have already toppled leaders in Egyptand Tunisia, governments in the region are taking notice.	 Saudi Arabia this week unveiled a $37 billion package to tryto insulate the kingdom from the wave of protests across theArab world, while Algeria lifted a 19-year-old state ofemergency as it tried to appease opposition groups.	 "When you start adding the potential number of barrels atstake, you can see why the market is tense and would rather belong oil than short," said Harry Tchilinguirian, chief commoditystrategies at BNP in London.	  INFLECTION POINT?	 Deutsche Bank said oil above $120 a barrel would be aninflection point for global economic growth. At that price, oilas a share of global GDP starts to move above 5.5 percent,historically a point where global growth has come underpressure.	 Airlines are feeling the brunt of high oil prices asreflected in sharp falls in stock prices. Chinese flag carrierAir China Ltd has dropped 14 percent this week.	 "Unfortunately, oil prices have been rising like madrecently," said Li Jiaxiang, head of the Civil AviationAdministation of China.	 Emerging Asia, which led the world's recovery from theglobal financial crisis, is already trying to deal withescalating food prices. Higher oil prices will add to thedilemma for policymakers of how to contain inflation and supporteconomic growth.	 Yet another complication is that while the crude pricespikes this week reflect a supply-side risk, oil prices werealready rising as economic activity around the world picked uppace.	 "The global recovery is ongoing, it is gaining more tractionbut the developments in the crude-oil sector as a result of theturmoil in the Middle East is putting to question the strengthof that recovery," said Jose Mario Cuyegkeng, economist at INGin Manila.	 Since most countries have little control over the worldprice of oil, raising interest rates would not address the issuefor their economies. But higher fuel prices could feed throughto other prices, such as transport, and inflation expectations.	 "The environment influencing inflation is now much moredifficult than what we had expected at the end of last year,"said Yim Jong-yong, South Korea's vice finance minister.	 Indonesian central bank deputy governor Hartadi A. Sarwonosaid he expects a recent drop in food and commodity prices topush monthly inflation down in the country, but oil was a risk.	 "We have to be cautious on long-term inflation from risingoil prices," he told reporters.	 The combination of high oil prices undermining growth whilefuelling inflation raises the prospect of stagflation thatblighted economies in the 1970s.	 Westpac rates strategist Russell Jones said there was a riskof stagflation but there were economic differences now --including less reliance on oil and better central bankcredibility -- to suggest any outbreak would be mild and shortlived.	 Still, it would still result in a pick up in the pace ofmonetary policy tightening, he said.	 "The longer that oil prices remain elevated, the more likelythat the European Central Bank and Bank of England could hike inthe second quarter. Emerging market central banks are also aptto tighten more aggressively.
