<raw><![CDATA[ LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - President Nicolas Sarkozy ofFrance accused Washington on Friday of setting the wrong exampleon protectionism, suggesting there had not been a level playingfield in the race for a $50 billion refuelling plane contract. U.S. defence contractor Northrop Grumman and its Europeanpartner EADS withdrew on Monday from a renewed competition tosupply tankers to the U.S. Air Force, saying the rules favouredrival bidder Boeing, the top U.S. exporter. Boeing is now the sole known bidder for the contract. Asked what he thought of the issue during a joint pressconference with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Sarkozydelivered a scathing attack on how the United States had handledthe tender. "I did not appreciate this decision ... This is not theright way to behave," Sarkozy said. "Such methods by the United States are not good for itsEuropean allies, and such methods are not good for the UnitedStates, a great, leading nation with which we are on close andfriendly terms," he said. "If they want to be heard in the fight againstprotectionism, they should not set the example ofprotectionism." For EADS, the parent company of the Airbus plane-maker, thestand-down was a setback in a major push to pierce the lucrativeU.S. military market. Northrop and EADS won the last competition in February 2008,but the Pentagon cancelled that deal after government auditorsupheld a protest by Boeing.
