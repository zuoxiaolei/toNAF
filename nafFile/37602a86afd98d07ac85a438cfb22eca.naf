<raw><![CDATA[ * Sanctions talk aimed at pressuring Iran to cooperate * U.S. lawmakers favor gasoline sanctions, but others wary * Marine insurers seen as key to any sanctions push By Ross Colvin and Caren Bohan WASHINGTON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The White House is weighingsanctions targeting Iran's dependence on gasoline imports andinsurance firms that underwrite the trade, even as they focuson diplomacy, including a meeting in Geneva on Thursday, torein in Iran's nuclear program. U.S. President Barack Obama warned Iran last week to comeclean about the program, which Washington fears is a cover tobuild atomic weapons, or face "sanctions that bite." Hiswarning followed the disclosure of a secret uranium enrichmentfacility near the holy Iranian city of Qom. The United States will hold direct talks with Iran inGeneva, along with France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China.U.S. officials say they will demand that Iran allow U.N.nuclear inspectors unfettered access to the Qom site, as wellas to documents and personnel. Despite Obama's comments, administration officials say thatfor now they hope Western powers can persuade Iran to addressconcerns about its nuclear program, which Tehran insists is forthe peaceful generation of electricity. Publicly, officials are reluctant to discuss the steps theyare considering, wary of creating an impression they viewdiplomacy as merely a smokescreen for eventual sanctions. But Obama's warning to Iran and the increased chatter aboutsanctions in Washington is very deliberate, Iran experts say. "If the Iranians are not convinced that there is apersuasive amount of economic pressure that might be applied,then they are more likely to be recalcitrant on Thursday," saidSuzanne Maloney from the Brookings Institution's Saban Center. DIPLOMACY IS 'PLAN A' "I don't mean to suggest it is a bluff, but the sanctionstalk is to set the stage for plan A, which is the diplomacy.Everything I have heard from the administration is that theygenuinely understand the difficulty of sanctions," she said. Sanctions "are not an instrument that can produce resultswith speed," said Ray Takeyh, a scholar at the Council onForeign Relations, who was, until recently, an adviser to theObama administration. Mindful of the limitations of sanctions, the administrationhas consulted outside experts for their views on the mosteffective way to implement such measures. The White House is being urged to consider a wide range ofoptions, including choking off gasoline supplies, a popularidea among U.S. lawmakers, although experts stress it is no"silver bullet" and must be part of a battery of measures. U.S. officials are considering ways to discourage bigfinancial firms from providing insurance for shipments to Iran.Such moves could affect big European companies such as Lloyd'sof London and Munich Re. "The key fulcrum is the insurance and reinsurancecompanies," said Mark Dubowitz, of the Foundation for Defenseof Democracies policy institute. "It's difficult to shipwithout insurance and reinsurance." The U.N. Security Council has already imposed three sets ofsanctions on Iran for refusing to freeze uranium enrichmentbut they have had only a limited impact and Tehran insists itbe allowed to pursue its nuclear program. OIL TRADERS SKEPTICAL Many U.S. lawmakers believe gasoline sanctions could beparticularly effective against Iran, which imports 40 percentof its gasoline. They hope that the ensuing economic hardshipcould drive a wedge between the Iranian people and theirleaders, who they believe have been weakened by a recentdisputed election. "We can't assume a sanctions regime would be effective inphysically reducing the supply of gasoline to Iran (but) itwould probably have an impact in driving the price higher forIranians," said Tim Evans, energy analyst for Citi FuturesPerspective in New York. U.S. Congressman Howard Berman, chairman of the House ofRepresentatives Foreign Affairs Committee, plans to bringforward a bill in October that would impose sanctions onforeign companies that export refined petroleum products. But oil traders are skeptical it would work. "I know for a fact that the market will find a way to meetdemand from Iran, regardless of sanctions," said an oil traderin the Gulf. "At a price, people will just do the deal." Officials in Washington also acknowledge the difficulty ofgetting multilateral support for such sanctions. Russia andChina, who have close trading ties with Iran, have expressedreluctance as has France's foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner.  Patrick Clawson, an Iran expert at the WashingtonInstitute for Near East Policy, said Europeans were more likelyto support actions aimed at investment in Iran's energy sectorthan those aiming to cut off gasoline supplies. European oil companies have repeatedly said sanctions are amatter for governments and that they will abide by them. "I have been warning people that if you want to cut offIran's gasoline imports, then you have to cut off theirsupplies in every country in the world," Clawson said. He notedthat Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has indicated awillingness to provide Iran with ample supplies of gasoline. A shipping source also pointed out Iran has its own fleetof oil tankers, limiting the effectiveness of any sanctions.
