<raw><![CDATA[ By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Investors have been sharply cutting their exposure to bonds this month, concerned by higherinflation expectations and as their appetite for riskier assetshas grown, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said on Tuesday. The U.S. investment bank's December survey of 302 fundmanagers also showed rising confidence among investors aboutfuture economic growth and corporate earnings growth. "Investors feel almost compelled to invest in risk assets atthe moment, and that's down to the Fed," said Garry Baker, thefirm's European equity strategist. The Federal Reserve announced a $600 billion asset-buyingprogramme in November designed to pump ample liquidity into theU.S. economy and hence global financial system. One "victim" of the return of risk appetite on financialmarkets has been government bonds. The fund manager survey found that investors had cut theirexposure to bonds in December to the lowest level since April. Respondents to the survey were a net 47 percent underweightin bonds versus 36 percent a month earlier, a number derived bysubtracting underweight positions from overweight ones. BofA-Merrill does not differentiate between bonds in itsquestionnaire, but said there was widespread negativity towardsthe asset class as a whole. The average position over the pastnine years has been 33 percent underweight. "The overall message is still very optimistic on growth,"Baker said. In contrast to bonds, investors were relatively bullish onequities. A net 40 percent were overweight in equities in the survey,slightly lower than the 41 percent in November but well abovethe levels of summer.  GROWTH Elsewhere in the survey, there was a large jump in thepercentage of respondents expecting higher economic growth overthe next 12 months. A net 44 percent now fit into this category compared with anet 35 percent in November and 0 percent three months ago. Corporate profit expectations have also risen, with a net 51percent expecting profits to improve over 12 months versus 36percent last month. BofA-Merrill's composite risk appetite indicator, based onthe poll, was steady in the month, but at plus 45 was higherthan its long-term average of plus 40.
