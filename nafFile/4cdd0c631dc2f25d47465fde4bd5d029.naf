<raw><![CDATA[ SEOUL, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister StephenHarper on Thursday said he was not sure the G20 summit in Seoulcould successfully address the question of global imbalances. "The persistence of these imbalances is a problem in the longterm and these things have to be addressed ... will they beaddressed at this conference? I'm not so sure, but I think we'regetting a more frank discussion on some of these matters, thatthey do have to be resolved," he told reporters. Harper said he also felt the U.S. Federal Reserve's decisionto print more money was the only option available, in theshort-term at least, given the very slow growth rate of the U.S.economy. "Those who are criticising the policy of the Federal Reserve-- I'm not sure what alternative they are suggesting," he said.
