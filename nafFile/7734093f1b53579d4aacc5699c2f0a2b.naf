<raw><![CDATA[ * EU governments, lawmakers split on use of cloning for food * Further talks planned to try to reach agreement  By Charlie Dunmore BRUSSELS, March 17 (Reuters) - European Union governmentsand lawmakers remained deadlocked on how to regulate theproduction and sale of food from cloned animals, followingall-night talks in Brussels that ended on Thursday morning. EU sources said the remaining sticking point was a demand bylawmakers in the European Parliament for a full EU ban on thesale of food derived from cloned animals and, crucially, theiroffspring. EU governments and the bloc's executive support an EU ban onthe use of cloning for food production, and on the import andsale of food from clones. But banning the sale of food derived from the offspring ofcloned animals would be impractical and disrupt global trade, asmeat, milk and processed products from such animals cannot bedistinguished from those produced traditionally, they argued. The Parliament's representatives in the negotiations accusedEU governments and the European Commission of intransigence,saying they had turned a blind eye to the ethical and animalwelfare concerns raised by the use of cloning for food. "It is ... incredible that the Council is willing to turn ablind eye to public opinion, as well as the ethical and animalwelfare problems associated with cloning," EU lawmakers GianniPittella and Kartika Liotard said in a joint statement. Under EU procedures, governments and the Parliament haveuntil the end of March to reach an agreement on the draftlegislation, which regulates the approval and sale of "novelfoods" not widely consumed in the EU before 1997. A final round of negotiations is scheduled for March 28.  MARKET FOR CLONES Animal cloning -- which uses DNA transfer to create an exactgenetic copy of an animal -- currently has a success rate ofbelow 20 percent, with most cloned animals dying during orshortly after birth. The technique is complex and costly, ensuring that clonedanimals are unlikely to be used directly as food, but they canbe bred traditionally to produce offspring that share similartraits, such as high milk production or rapid growth. The United States is the most advanced country in terms ofanimal cloning for food production, with estimates provided bycompanies suggesting that "thousands of cattle" and "hundreds ofpigs" have been cloned there so far. The United States currently has a voluntary moratorium onthe marketing of food from cloned animals, but not from theiroffspring. In August, it emerged that meat from the offspring of acloned cow was placed on the market by a dairy farm in Scotland,leading some British supermarkets to pledge not to sell any meatfrom clones or their young.
