<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro holds gains vs dollar, hits 1-mth high vs CHF * Support seen from speculation of euro zone debt measures * Spain sees strong demand at debt auction (Releads, updates throughout; previous TOKYO) By Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The euro hit a one-month highagainst the Swiss franc and edged up versus the dollar onThursday as speculation that measures to tame the euro zone debtcrisis may be on their way prompted short covering. The euro nudged up to the day's high versus the dollar afterSpain attracted strong demand at an auction of five-year bonds.Investors had been eyeing the sale to see if debt problemsplaguing Greece, Ireland and Portugal will spread to Madrid andbeyond. The single currency added to gains made on Wednesday, whensolid demand at a Portuguese auction quelled some concerns aboutthe country's snowballing financing costs, prompting a buy backof euros after it hit a four-month low early this week. Meanwhile, traders said jitters before an upcoming emergencymeeting of Swiss unions and industry and trade representativestriggered selling in the Swiss franc against the euro, pushingthe euro to 1.2837 francs, its highest since mid-December. Analysts said the euro was supported after German FinanceMinister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Wednesday that euro zonecountries are working on a "comprehensive package" to solve thebloc's debt crisis, which could be agreed by February or March. "We're wary of positioning for euro downside tooaggressively because there seems to be more news that Germanyand France are going to push through some emergency resolutionpackage," said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS. "So the euro could rally going into this." The euro rose 0.2 percent on the day at $1.3170, recoveringfrom an early slide to $1.3089. The single currency was supported by its 200-day movingaverage of $1.3070 after it rose as high as $1.3145 onWednesday. The euro has recovered from a fall to around $1.2860on Monday, its weakest since mid-September. It also poked above $1.3152, the 50 percent retracement ofthe recent fall from around $1.3435 to $1.2870. Despite the euro's rise this week, market participants saythe euro remains vulnerable to selling if euro zone debtproblems deteriorate further. "At best the euro could rise to around $1.33. Butfundamentally, the euro still has headline risks. Even ifinvestors' risk appetite grows, they have many other currenciesto buy," said Minoru Shioiri, forex manager at Mitsubishi UFJMorgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo. "The euro's downtrend will end only when there is a morenegative story on the dollar," he said. The European Central Bank announces its monthly policydecision later in the day, and President Jean-Claude Trichetwill speak to reporters at 1330 GMT. While no policy changes areexpected, focus will be on the central bank's bond-buyingprogramme and its reaction to higher inflation.   SPAIN AUCTION Spain's offer of five-year bonds was met with strong demandeven as the paper came with an average yield of 4.542 percent,higher than 3.576 percent at a previous sale. Expectations hadbeen for a yield of around 5 percent. However, the Spanish results are seen doing little to changethe view that Portugal will continue to struggle and willultimately follow Greece and Ireland in seeking aid from the EUand IMF. Support for the euro kept the dollar weak. The dollar index,which tracks the greenback's performance against a basket ofmajor currencies, was little changed on the day at 79.98 afterhaving lost about 1 percent this week. The dollar moved sideways against the yen at 82.98 yen,holding within the previous session's trading range. The Aussie was unchanged at $0.9966 after a surprisinglysmall rise in employment data, though strong commodity pricesand the currency's high interest rates limited its losses.
