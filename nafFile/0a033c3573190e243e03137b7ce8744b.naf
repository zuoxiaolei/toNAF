"Unfortunately there are dissonances in public," Juncker wasquoted as telling the German Handelsblatt newspaper in aninterview to be published in its Thursday edition. Governments "should suppress the reflex to ask before eachEuropean agreement how it will go down at home."  The newspaper also quoted Juncker as saying EU summitdecisions had "given cause for market turbulences". It said Juncker would raise the topic of joint euro zonebonds at an EU meeting on Thursday and Friday but did not expecta decision on them. Germany opposes the proposal, which would seek to use itshigh credit standing to raise funds jointly with weaker eurozone economies such as Portugal and Greece. EU leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday and Friday for theirend-of-year summit, with efforts to overcome the region'syear-long debt crisis at the heart of their agenda.  As well as approving a change to the EU's treaty demanded byGermany to create a permanent system for handling crises frommid-2013, EU leaders will discuss how they can improve thecurrent temporary financial safety net -- a 750 billion euro ($1trillion) joint EU/IMF loan facility.
