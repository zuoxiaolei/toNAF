<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The euro traded down against the U.S. dollar  Tuesday weighed by Spain’s long term borrowing costs, following a disappointing government debt auction, while hopes for progress on the region’s debt crisis at the European Summit faded.EUR/USD hit 1.2456 during U.S. trade, the pair’s lowest since June 12; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2470, giving back 0.27%. The pair was likely to find near-term support at 1.2409, the low of June 6 and resistance at 1.2529, the session high. The euro gave up small early gains against the greenback upon Spain witnessing short-term borrowing costs rise sharply at an auction of government debt. Spain’s Treasury auctioned slightly more that the targeted amount of EUR 3 billion, selling EUR1.6 billion worth of three-month government bonds at an average yield of 2.36%, up sharply from 0.84% at a similar auction last month. Spain also sold EUR1.48 billion of six-month debt at an average yield of 3.23%, up from 1.73% in May. The spike in borrowing costs came following the mass downgrade of 28 Spanish banks by ratings agency Moody’s on Monday, after Spain’s government formally requested aid of up to EUR100 billion for its banks. Following the auction, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds rose to 6.77%, re-approaching the critical 7% threshold, which is widely viewed as unsustainable in the long term. Meanwhile, Italy’s Treasury sold EUR2.99 billion worth of two-year bonds at an average yield of 4.71%, the highest since December. Investors also remained nervous ahead of the upcoming EU summit, amid skepticism that leaders would make progress on greater fiscal integration and allowing the bloc's rescue funds to buy government debt. In the U.S., data indicated that U.S. consumer confidence declined more-than-expected in June, falling to the lowest level since January. The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence fell to 62.0 in June from a downwardly revised reading of 64.4 last month and disappointing expectations for a reading of 63.5. A separate report showed that the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller U.S. house price index fell at an annualized rate of 1.9% in April from a year earlier, better than expectations for a 2.5% drop. U.S. home prices in March fell by an unrevised 2.6%. In addition, the euro was lower against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP falling 0.48% to hit 0.7990 and EUR/JPY down 0.37% to trade at 99.25. Later Tuesday, finance ministers from Germany, France, Italy and Spain were to meet in Paris, to hold talks ahead of the EU summit on Thursday and Friday.             ]]></raw>
