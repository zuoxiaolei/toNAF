<raw><![CDATA[ TOKYO, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Japan's new transport minister,Seiji Maehara, said he would review turnaround plans for JapanAirlines Corp (JAL) as bidders circle the loss-making carrier. Speaking at his first news conference since being appointedon Wednesday as part of a new Japanese government, Maehara saidhe wanted to know if the state-supervised revitalisation for thecarrier was feasible and he would change the members of anindependent panel reviewing the turnaround plan. JAL, which is undergoing a state-supervised overhaul,reportedly aims to raise 250 billion yen ($2.75 billion) througha mixture of equity and debt financing by March to fund arestructuring plan including cutting 6,800 jobs. Delta Airlines and American Airlines are in rival talks toinvest in Asia's largest airline by revenue and JAL wants toclose a deal by mid-October. The new government, led by the Democratic Party, could changethe situation if it decides to take a harder stance than theprevious Liberal Democratic Party administration, which had putits weight behind a state-assisted revamp of JAL. Maehara has previously questioned the heavy hand played bygovernment in the aviation industry and urged furtherderegulation.
