<raw><![CDATA[   *Flight to yen, Swissie & U.S. Treasuries gathers pace *Dollar could gain on month-end hedging requirements *Aussie, NZ dlrs trampled in global stampede to safety By Anirban Nag SYDNEY, June 30 (Reuters) - The yen and the Swiss francheld on to broad gains on Wednesday as nervous investors rushedto unwind leveraged carry trades on the back of a significantdeterioration in risk appetite. While doubts about a global recovery were playing out,traders said, the rush towards safe-haven currencies may proveto be short lived once quarter-end hedging and repatriationflows are taken care of. Traders said the U.S. dollar  could benefit frommonth-end buying after a fall in Wall Street  this monthleft many non-U.S. investors requiring to buy dollars torebalance their portfolios. "It is worth emphasizing that the fall in global equitiesthis month biases today's month-end fix towards U.S. dollarbuying," JP Morgan said in a morning note. "The rationale is threefold--non-U.S. investors hedgeglobal equity exposure more than U.S. investors do; a fall inUS equities during the month leaves non-U.S. investorsoverhedged on their S&P holdings; thus hedge rebalancingrequires dollar purchases at the fix." The S&P-500 index has lost over 4 percent this month andwas looking increasingly bearish on the charts. In Asian trade, the U.S. dollar index  was up 0.13percent at 86.14, and is likely to face resistance in the 86.42to 86.48 region. The latter is the 38.2 percent of the index'sdecline from a high of 88.71 to its recent low of 85.09. Dollar/yen  was subdued at 88.63 yen, having lostnearly 1 percent on Tuesday as a rush to safety pushed U.S.two-year Treasury yields to record lows. Support is seen ataround 88.00 yen, the low struck on May 6. The euro was softer at $1.2185, not far from a two-week lowof $1.2152 , struck in the previous session. Technicalanalysts noted $1.2150 as a key level, saying a break wouldopen the way for a retest of the psychologically important$1.2000 mark and the pair's four-year low around $1.1875 set onJune 7. The euro  was at 107.91, not far from its 8-Â½  year low of 107.33 yen struck on Tuesday. Against the Swissfranc, it hovered near record lows of 1.3167 francs . The franc  has gained broadly since the SwissNational Bank this month backed off its pledge to intervene inthe currency market to stem its strength and as general spikein risk aversion saw investors veer towards safe-havencurrencies. Uncertainty about the global recovery grew after datashowed a steep fall in U.S. consumer confidence, a sharpdownward revision to China's leading indicator index and anunexpected rise in in Japanese unemployment.

Interbank euro funding costs rose toan eight-month high on fears the expiry of nearly half atrillion euros of emergency loans this week may cause strainsfor some banks. For details, see [ID:nN29137639] Euro zone banks must repay 442 billion euros ($539 billion)on Thursday borrowed a year ago at low rates as part of theEuropean Central Bank's efforts to boost liquidity. Investorsfear this could leave banks facing a liquidity shortfall. To offset the burden that banks will face in paying backthe money, the ECB has offered extra borrowing opportunitiesfor them, including unlimited three-month funds on Wednesday.See [ID:nLDE65S20V] Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars  remained under pressure. TheAussie was flat at $0.8500, after having fallen over 1.5percent to as low as  $0.8463 offshore, the lowest since June11. Support for the Aussie is seen at around $0.8425, the lowstruck on June 11.
