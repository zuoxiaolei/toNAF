<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar was trading close to two-and-a-half year highs against the yen on Monday, as expectations for more aggressive easing by the Bank of Japan remained intact, weighing on the yen.USD/JPY hit 91.25 during late Asian trade; the pair’s highest since June 21 2010; the pair subsequently consolidated at 90.71, slipping 0.20%.The pair was likely to find support at 89.62, the low of January 18 and resistance at 92.35.The yen remained under pressure after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for a closer relationship with the BOJ in a policy speech on Monday and added that it is important for the central bank to achieve its 2% inflation target “as soon as possible.”Over the weekend, Japan's economy minister rejected criticism that Japan’s fiscal and monetary stimulus program was aimed at weakening the yen.Traders remained cautious ahead of U.S. data on fourth quarter growth and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy statement on Wednesday and U.S. nonfarm payrolls data on Friday.Elsewhere, the yen pulled back from 21-month lows against the euro, with EUR/JPY slipping 0.40% to 121.79.The U.S. was to release government data on durable goods orders, as well as private sector data on pending home sales later in the trading day.             ]]></raw>
