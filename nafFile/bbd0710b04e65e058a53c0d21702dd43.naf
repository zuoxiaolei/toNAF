<raw><![CDATA[(Repeats to detach from previous item. Text unchanged.) * MSCI world equity index down 0.2 pct at 314.35 * Euro off highs, bunds supported after Greek T-bill auction * Yen erases gains after ruling party lawmakers comments  By Natsuko Waki LONDON, April 13 (Reuters) - The euro erased short-livedgains while German government bonds drew support on Tuesdayafter a debt sale by Greece that, while successful, remindedinvestors the country's borrowing costs remain very high. World stocks fell from the previous day's 18-1/2 month highas investors awaited a slew of key corporate earnings to helpgauge the strength of the economy. The yen wiped earlier gainsafter lawmakers from Japan's ruling party said the domesticcurrency should fall to around 120 per dollar. Greece easily sold a total of 1.2 billion euros ($1.63billion) of 6-month and one-year T-bills, passing its firstborrowing test since the euro zone reached a deal on a standbyrescue package for the debt-laden country. But analysts said the yields on the bills -- 4.55 percentand 4.85 percent respectively -- were still high, remindinginvestors that borrowing remained costly and the budget underpressure. "Clearly the yields are still very high and longer-term bondyields remain very high even by recent standards," said Ben May,economist at Capital Economics. "So it does not really change the underlying position thatGreece has very tough times ahead. It's going through a deeprecession and that's going to lead the debt to GDP ratio tosurge higher." The euro rose around 20 ticks after the sale, but then fellback to stand steady on the day at $1.3590 . The Greek/German 10-year government bond yield spread  reached a session low of 356 basispoints, about 5 basis points tighter on the day. The German bundfuture  was up 4 ticks. "The outright yield on the bills is still some way above therates implied by (the weekend's) package and as such reflects adegree of scepticism about the facility," said Adam Cole, headof currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets. In Japan, a group of lawmakers from the ruling party saidefforts should be made to maintain "appropriate" currency levelsof around 120 yen per dollar. The yen fell as low as 93.42 per dollar  after thecomments, erasing earlier gains. The draft proposal also called for the government and theBank of Japan to use all monetary and fiscal policy toolsavailable to erase deflation.  The dollar  was down 0.1 percent against a basket ofmajor currencies.  STOCKS AND EARNINGSThe MSCI world equity index  fell 0.2 percentafter reaching its highest level since September 2008 on Monday. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  fell 0.1 percent whileemerging stocks  lost half a percent. U.S. stockfutures  pointed to a weaker open on Wall Street later. U.S. companies reporting results this week include JP Morgan, Google , Bank of America  and GeneralElectric .
