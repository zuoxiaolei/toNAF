<raw><![CDATA[ * More evidence of two-speed recovery * Service sector grows at slower pace this month * Manufacturing sector growth accelerates  By Jonathan Cable LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The euro zone's economic recoverylost momentum this month as a surprise upswing in Germany wasoffset by slowing growth in France, and manufacturers countereda poorer performance in the service sector, surveys showed. Markit's Eurozone Flash Services Purchasing Managers' Index,made up of surveys of around 2,000 businesses ranging from banksto restaurants, fell to 53.2 in October from September's 54.1,its lowest reading since February. The index has now been above the 50.0 mark that dividesgrowth in business activity from contraction since August 2009but was shy of the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for53.7."The recovery is becoming ever more dependent on themanufacturing sector and Germany in particular. The periphery isreally struggling and increasingly so as we moved into thefourth quarter," said Chris Williamson at Markit. The manufacturing sector, which drove a large part of theeconomic recovery last year, saw activity pick up faster thanexpected this month, driven by a buoyant Germany and strong neworders. The flash manufacturing index rose to 54.1 in October from53.7 in September, confounding forecasts for a fall to 53.2,while the output index slipped to 53.8 this month, from 54.0 inSeptember. France's service sector grew much more sluggishly than lastmonth and at its slowest pace since March while itsmanufacturing sector saw growth tail off slightly more thanexpected. But data from neighbouring Germany, Europe's biggesteconomy, showed the pace of growth accelerated with both itsservice and manufacturing sectors expanding much faster thanexpected. Figures on Tuesday showed Germany's ZEW sentiment index, akey gauge of German analyst and investor sentiment, fell lessthan expected in October, bolstering hopes that any slowdown inEurope's powerhouse economy will be milder than forecast. The euro zone manufacturing sector's new orders index roseto 54.3 this month from 53.2 in September, despite the euro hitting 8-month highs against the dollar last week, withcompanies reporting increased sales to China, Eastern Europe,the U.S. and from within the euro zone.  GROWTH GEARS DOWN The composite index, made up from the services andmanufacturing sectors and often used to predict overall growth,dropped to 53.4 this month from 54.1 in September, missingexpectations for 53.6. "If it holds at this level for the rest of the quarter youare looking at a 0.3 percent rise in GDP so that is down fromwhat we estimate was a 0.6 percent rise in the third quarter,"Williamson said. The euro zone escaped from its deepest recession in post-warhistory in the third quarter of last year, having pumpedbillions of euros into recovery measures, and relatively strongsecond-quarter growth of 1.0 percent surprised markets.Economists in a Reuters poll say growth has since slowed andexpect the economy to expand between 0.2 and 0.4 percent perquarter through to the end of next year. The service sector's backlogs of work index slumped to 49.6this month -- its first time below 50 since January -- fromSeptember's 51.6, signalling firms were not operating at fullcapacity. Companies hired fewer new workers this month, with thecomposite employment index falling to 51.0 from 51.4 inSeptember. The manufacturing sector took on staff at the fastestpace since March 2008 but job creation slowed to show almost nogrowth in services. Data released earlier this month showed unemployment was at10.1 percent in August, having hovered around 10 percent forfive months. (Editing by Toby Chopra)             ]]></raw>
