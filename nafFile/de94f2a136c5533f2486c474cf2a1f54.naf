<raw><![CDATA[ * Emerging markets rise on commodities, Q3 earnings hopes * Russian rouble highest since January * Eastern European currencies rebound, Turkish lira eases  By Sebastian Tong LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Emerging assets were firmer onMonday, hovering at more-than-one-year highs, buoyed by optimismover third-quarter earnings and robust commodity prices. Russia's rouble hit its highest since January against itseuro-dollar basket even as most Eastern European currenciesrebounded from previous week lows.  Overnight losses in Asian markets including China and SouthKorea kept the key equity index  flat, staying just offthe 13-month high it reached on Friday but emerging sovereigndebt spreads <11EMJ> tightened 1 basis point to trade at levelslast seen 14 months ago. Monday's U.S. and Japanese market holidays lent trading asubdued tone but risk appetite was otherwise bolstered by hopesthat the start of the corporate results reporting season wouldconfirm the quickening pace of global recovery. "The third-quarter earnings season has come into play butyou won't see the big surprises that we had in the secondquarter. In fact, we could see some disappointment that couldtrigger some profit-taking over the coming weeks," said SimonQuijano-Evans, emerging Europe economist and strategist atCheuvreux. The commodities-focused bourses of South Africa  andRussia saw healthy gains with gold  staying aloft atrecord levels while oil  climbing above $73 a barrel. Russian shares  powered up nearly 3 percent to13-month highs while the rouble firmed to its highest levelversus its euro-dollar basket  since mid-January,following six consecutive weeks of gains.While the central bank has been seen buying dollars to slowthe rouble's appreciation, traders say the new interventionlevel is located at 35.80 to the basket, compared to 35.85previously. [ID:nLC356999]  REBOUND After their recent bout of weakness, most Eastern Europeancurrencies rebounded, helped in part by buoyant regional bourseswhich saw Polish , Czech  and Hungarian stocks rising to two-week highs. The Czech crown was up versus euro  for the firsttime in nearly two weeks, after data showing asmaller-than-expected current account gap tempered expectationsthat the central bank would lower interest rates further fromtheir all-time low. [ID:nLC679110]  Helping to support sentiment in the region was the moreconciliatory note sounded by Latvian Prime Minister ValdisDombrovskis towards its international lenders who last weekcriticised the Baltic state for backtracking on budget targets. Dombrovskis said on Monday his government was moving towardsfulfilling the conditions of its loan deal, and was carrying outsufficient fiscal consolidation measures to satisfyinternational lenders. [ID:nDKT004664] Expectations that Turkey's central bank will cut itsbenchmark borrowing rate by 50 basis points at its policymeeting this Thursday weighed on the lira  but helpeddrive the country's key equity index  to its highestlevel since January 2008. [ID:nLC624301] Sentiment remains supported by hopes that Ankara will soonreach a loan accord with the International Monetary Fund.
