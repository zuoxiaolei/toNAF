<raw><![CDATA[ By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent LONDON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Euro zone debt worries, thesurvival of IMF deals in Eastern Europe, elections, protests,leadership dynamics in Russia and internal divisions in Turkeycould all affect emerging European investors in 2011. Below are the key political risks to watch. WESTERN EUROPE'S WOES For many investors in emerging Europe, the key politicalrisks are not from within the region at all but from the moreestablished economies of Western Europe as they struggle tocontain the euro zone debt crisis. The key issues will be whether the euro zone's most troubledstates -- particularly Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy andSpain -- can make tough spending cuts and placate bond marketsand whether the bloc can make wider reforms. If Western Europe does sink back towards recession, aknock-on effect on exports from emerging Europe could have amarked impact on economies and assets. In a two-day summit in December, EU states agreed to createa crisis fund from 2013 -- but some market players still worrythere may not be enough money to bail out countries such asSpain or Portugal if they need it in the coming year. What to watch: -- any renewed crisis in Greece, Ireland or elsewhere willlikely have a knock-on market impact in the emerging EU,possibly again raising worries over the most troubled statessuch as Hungary. -- Any broader reform of EU treaties, bailout regimes orbond haircuts will have a particular impact on accession statessuch as Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltics. IMF, AUSTERITY AND "UNCONVENTIONAL MEASURES" Emerging European countries were amongst the first hit bythe financial crisis in 2008, forcing many to turn to theInternational Monetary Fund and EU for bailouts that oftenbrought with them harsh austerity measures. While some countries -- such as Latvia -- earned plauditsfrom Brussels and the IMF for taking the harsh medicine,Hungary's new Fidesz government is walking a more unconventionalpath prompting the collapse of its deal. That has disturbedinvestors who worry the pattern might be repeated elsewhere inthe region. Hungary says it must regain its financial independence. Ithas not yet released full details of its structural reforms.Fiscal measures so far have included special taxes on banks andsome corporate sectors and what pension funds described as aneffective renationalisation of mandatory private pensionschemes.  The government is also poised to change the central banklaw, aiming to pack the Monetary Council with its own candidatesnext March when the mandates of four out of seven membersexpire. Other countries such as Romania are continuing to pushforward with their IMF deals -- although like their counterpartsin Western Europe they face an almost inevitable uptick instrikes, protests and other civil unrest as well as mountingstrains within governments. What to watch: -- Action by ratings agencies against Hungary or further"unconventional measures" by the government there could unsettlemarkets across the wider region. Any perceived movement backtowards the IMF consensus would be taken well. -- The failure of another IMF deal could hit markets acrossthe region. ELECTIONS AND PROTESTS Latvia's ruling coalition performed relatively well inelections earlier this year, proving that austerities might notalways prove electorally toxic. But in other emerging EUcountries, the pressure of spending cuts is pressuringcoalitions sometimes to the brink of destruction. Romania's government narrowly survived no-confidence votesthis year over planned cuts, with political uncertaintyrepeatedly knocking asset prices. In the Czech Republic, ties between the three coalitionparties have been strained after all three did badly in upperhouse elections. Further tensions between the parties couldundermine investor confidence and make budget approval, pensionand health reforms even more difficult. In Hungary, Fidesz has a two-thirds majority together withits Christian Democrat allies and has used that clout widely,stripping the Constitutional Court of its jurisdiction overmatters related to state finances. Some analysts describe it as an attack on democratic checksand balances but the government looks set to push ahead withplans for a new constitution next year. What to watch: -- Signs of coalition strains in any emerging Europeancountry with an IMF programme would almost certainly worrymarkets. Romania probably looks most in focus, with centristPrime Minister Emil Boc likely facing repeated bids to topplehim and spark a full-blown political crisis. -- As in Western Europe, particularly widespread protestscould also grab investor attention, especially if they were seenblocking or reversing reforms outright. RUSSIA -- OIL AND LEADERSHIP In Russia, all eyes will be on the leadership dynamicbetween Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and President DmitryMedvedev in the run-up to the presidential elections in 2012 inwhich both could potentially stand. Putin is by far the dominant member of what Russianofficials call the ruling "tandem" -- with leaked US diplomaticcables from WikiLeaks describing the younger, shorter Medvedevas "Robin" to Putin's "Batman". Most analysts and diplomats expect Putin to return to theKremlin in 2012 and believe Russia will be stable while he is incontrol, although in the longer term some investors have worriesover such reliance on an individual. Putin himself says he and Medvedev will make a decisioncloser to 2012 as to who is to stand. Some clarity could emergeafter the 2011 parliamentary elections. The world's biggest energy producer, Russia is heavilyreliant on oil and gas exports and any sustained fall in theprice of benchmark Urals crude below the budgeted average of $75per barrel would hit hard, and potentially undermine Putin. Butprices moving higher could strengthen Moscow's hand and driveheightened investor enthusiasm. What to watch: -- Clarity on presidential election plans, although a formalstatement is unlikely until closer to the time. Any real signsof discord between Putin and Medvedev could provoke aconstitutional crisis and unnerve investors. -- Progress against corruption, described by Westernexecutives as the biggest barrier to business in Russia. TURKEY -- ELECTIONS AND TENSIONS Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan is widely tipped towin a third consecutive term of single party rule in generalelections in June 2011, helped by strong economic growth butwith a religious/secular divide a potential flashpoint. Opponents of Erdogan's AK Party accuses it of having ahidden long-term Islamic agenda, with long-running strainsbetween the government and secular military aggravated by a highprofile court cases against military officers accused ofplotting a coup. A debate over the use of religious headscarves -- a delicatesubject that cuts to the heart of national identity -- have alsoresurfaced after the Higher Education Board ordered IstanbulUniversity to stop excluding students wearing them. Opponents of the headscarf ban say it is a violation ofindividual freedom, while supporters say it is vital to Turkey'ssecular principles. What to watch: -- Comments from the new armed forces chief General IsikKosaner as trials start over the so-called 2003 "Sledgehammer"plot to destabilise Erdogan and pave the way for militaryintervention. -- Any government moves to ease the headscarf ban orattempts to rewrite the constitution. -- Relations with the U.S. -- which have become increasinglystrained over Turkey's deteriorating relationship with Israel --and the European Union, hobbled by wrangling over the dividedisland of Cyprus.
