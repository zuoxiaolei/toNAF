<raw><![CDATA[ * Investors look to U.S. payrolls data * Smooth Spanish auction helps euro in earlier trade * Traders cautious ahead of Friday's U.S. jobs data * Some suggest dollar selling running out of steam  (Recasts, updates prices, adds comment, detail) By Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The dollar was little changedagainst the euro on Thursday, as investors squared positionsahead of a U.S. payrolls report that markets hope will offerfresh insight on the state of the U.S. economy. Strong German industrial data and signs that Spain andGreece were making progress in trimming budget deficits earlierlifted the euro, as did data showing U.S. initial joblessclaims unexpectedly rose in the latest week. But after selling the dollar aggressively earlier thisweek, investors were unwinding some bets against it Thursday incase Friday's data shows a surprisingly strong jobs gain. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the United States lost65,000 jobs in July but added 90,000 in the private sector. Anindependent report from ADP Employment Services earlier thisweek said the private sector added 43,000 jobs in July. "Trading has been very choppy, which is typical on the daybefore U.S. payrolls, and after the ADP number, a lot of peopleare revising up their forecasts for tomorrow," said StevenButler, head of currency trading at Scotia Capital in Toronto. The euro was flat at $1.3150 . Earlier it rose to$1.3234 after data showed a surprise 19,000 rise in the numberof Americans filing for initial jobless benefits last week. A strong debt auction in Spain and a vote of confidencefrom the International Monetary fund in Greece's efforts to cutthe deficit also boosted euro buying during European trade. Formore see [[ID:nLAG006364]] and [ID:nLDE6740CM] Both countries were at the forefront of a euro zone debtcrisis that drove the currency below $1.19 in June, its worstshowing since 2006 The dollar fell 0.5 percent to 85.85 yen , just overa yen off a 15-year low, while sterling slipped 0.2 percent to$1.5847  after hitting a six-month high above $1.59this week. U.S. GROWTH FEARS OVERDONE? Recent signs of slower U.S. growth have hobbled the dollar;since July, it has lost about 6 percent against a basket ofmajor currencies. It fell this week along with short-dated U.S.Treasury yields amid speculation the Federal Reserve couldrevive Treasury and mortgage bond purchase to boost growth. But Butler said it appears traders "overreacted," addingthat the Fed "has been pretty clear that it's done acting fornow." Added Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com inBedminster, New Jersey: "the market increasingly thinks the Fedprobably won't do anything drastic after all, because while theU.S. data has been weak, it's not dire enough to panic." If Friday's payroll data meets or exceeds expectations, hesaid the dollar will likely rally to cap off the week. Butler said if the euro closes below the $1.3125 area,which marks the 38.2 percent retracement of the euro'sNovember-to-June decline, "you'll see anyone who boughtshort-term Treasuries looking for the exit, and that means theeuro heads back toward $1.30 and sterling toward $1.55." Currency strategists at Standard Chartered said in a noteto clients Thursday that investors should use current dollarweakness "to renew underweight positions in European currenciessuch as the euro and sterling," noting that September debtrollovers and the start of Britain's fiscal tightening willhurt those two currencies.
