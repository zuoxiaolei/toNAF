<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro gains vs dollar, pulls back from 1-year low vs yen * Traders cover shorts in euro, high yielders * Greece concerns limit gains (Adds comment, details; changes byline) By Jessica Mortimer LONDON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the dollarand the yen on Friday, recovering from steep falls the previousday as traders covered short positions ahead of the weekend. Traders granted the euro a reprieve after knocking it to aone-year low versus the yen on Thursday, although analysts saidthe currency remained vulnerable due to concerns about thefiscal health of Greece and some other euro zone countries. At the same time, worries that the U.S. economic recoverymay not be as robust as previously thought gathered pace afterrecent weak data, including rising U.S. jobless claims, fallingnew home sales and a drop in consumer confidence. "We generally expect that the euro will see more weaknessbut perhaps the market is being a bit more balanced as it isreminded that there are still challenges with the U.S. economy,"said Carl Hammer, currency strategist at SEB. By 1244 GMT, the euro  was up 0.2 percent to $1.3586,helped by a 0.4 percent rise in European shares . Against the yen  the euro was 0.4 percent higheron the day at 121.17 yen, clawing back losses after falling aslow as 119.66 yen on electronic trading platform EBS onThursday, its weakest since February 2009. The euro is poised to fall roughly 2.5 percent against theyen this week, according to Reuters charts. "The market was caught short (on euros and higher-yieldingcurrencies), so it's not surprising that we're getting aturnaround," said Ned Rumpeltin, currency strategist at Nomurain London. Some traders said the euro's gains were helped by its sharprise to a six-week high against sterling, which came under broadselling pressure after above-forecast gross domestic productdata failed to offset deeper worries over the UK economy. [GBP/] The euro  rose as high as 89.35 pence, itsstrongest since mid-January. The yen fell broadly, trimming gains after benefitingearlier this week from jitters about the global economicrecovery, prompting buying of the low-yielding currency.  The dollar  was up 0.2 percent at 89.20 yen.  FOCUS ON GREECE Despite the euro's rise on Friday, it stayed close to anine-month low of $1.3443 hit a week ago and analysts expectmore losses on concerns about how Greece will service its debts,and whether it will need support from other euro zone members. These worries eased a little, however, after Greek budgetrevenues in January exceeded expectations [ID:nATH005226],pushing down the premium investors demand to hold Greek bonds rather than benchmark German Bunds .[GVD/EUR] Investors awaited a slew of U.S. economic data.  A second reading of fourth-quarter economic growth is duelater in the day as well as a survey of manufacturing activityin the Midwest and the Reuters/University of Michigan poll onconsumer sentiment. A number of Federal Reserve officials will also speak onFriday, after Chairman Ben Bernanke earlier this week said aweak job market and tame inflation warrant low U.S. interestrates for an extended period.
