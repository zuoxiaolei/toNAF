<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – New Zealand’s dollar erased losses against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday, rebounding from a 4-day low as the U.S. faced widespread criticism of its USD600 billion stimulus plan.NZD/USD clawed back up from 0.7803, the pair’s lowest since November 3, to hit 0.7890 during European afternoon trade, gaining 0.15%.The pair was likely to find support at 0.7803 and resistance at 0.7937, Monday’s high.Earlier in the day, New Zealand’s finance minister Bill English said that the country’s export recovery is being hindered as the nation’s currency rises against a weak U.S. dollar.“Emerging economies are experiencing a strong recovery and our trade with those economies is growing,” he said. “Developed economies are recovering more slowly, and economies such as the U.K. and the U.S. are adopting policies that tend to devalue their exchange rates and create a headwind for our export recovery.”Prime Minister John Key’s political opponents have called on the government to act to curb the currency. However the prime minister said Monday that he was not convinced that central bank moving to sell the currency would work because of the associated costs.The kiwi was also up against the euro, with EUR/NZD shedding 0.16% to hit 1.7640.Earlier Tuesday, China and Taiwan enacted strict financial regulations designed to safeguard economic stability amid fears that the Federal Reserve’s decision last week to buy its own debt to keep borrowing costs near zero would lead investors seek higher yields in emerging markets.             ]]></raw>
