<raw><![CDATA[ * ECB money market chief say periphery banks still dependent * Dependent banks need plan to cure ECB over-reliance * ECB would only buy non-govt assets if specific problems  (Adds quotes, background) By Marc Jones FRANKFURT, March 3 (Reuters) - The euro zone money market ispolarised with banks in peripheral euro zone countries stilldependent on the European Central Bank for liquidity, the ECB'shead of market operations Francesco Papadia said on Thursday. Papadia, who oversees the ECB's crisis strategy andcontroversial government bond purchase programme, said the moneymarket remained split between banks who have access to openmarkets and those who do not. "When I try to summarise the situation in the money marketin one word, the word I use is 'polarisation'," Papadia said ata Euromoney conference, stressing it was his personal viewrather than that of the ECB. "Banks on aggregate are asking for much less liquidity thanthey were before... at the other pole some banks, particularlyin the so-called peripheral countries of the euro area, continueto crucially depend for their liquidity on the European CentralBank." The ECB is set to announce later on Thursday whether itfeels the time is right to start withdrawing its crisis supportmeasures having been forced to put the process on hold late lastyear by the euro zone debt crisis. A Reuters poll on Tuesday showed money market experts wereevenly split over whether the bank would resume its so-calledexit strategy by switching its 3-month lending operations backto capped-limit, competitive auctions, or wait a little longer.  LIQUIDITY BRIDGE Borrowing from the ECB  has dropped by 100billion euros since the start of the year, drastically reducingthe amount of excess cash that has long bloated and distortedmarkets. It has pushed interbank rates   back inthe directions of more normal levels, although there has beensharp fluctuations as banks have taken advantage of the ECB's 1percent, limit-free lending when market rates have climbed. Papadia said the swings needed to be taken into account. "It is not obvious that the volatility in rates... hasbecome such an overwhelming problem to really raise acuteconcerns but the issue needs to be checked and controlled." He urged reliant banks to come up with ways to end theirdependency on the ECB, calling national governments to takeaction where necessary. Using a metaphor, he fired a warning that the ECB did notwant to keep its liquidity support in place indefinitely. "Bridges are something that helps pass an obstacle. Bridgescannot have an indefinite length." He added that the ECB was highly unlikely to resurrect itscovered bond purchase programme that ended last year or buy anyother commercial assets. "There would need to be a special reason to do that (buynon-government assets). There would have to be something veryspecific there."
