<raw><![CDATA[ * Some progress in race to stabilise reactors * Radiation traces found in food and water * Quake and tsunami give Japan vast rebuilding task * More than 7,600 dead, nearly 11,750 missing By Taiga Uranaka and Yoko Nishikawa	 TOKYO, March 20 (Reuters) - Japan made some progress in itsrace to avert disaster at a tsunami-damaged power plant, thoughminor radiation leaks underlined perils from the world's worstnuclear crisis since Chernobyl 25 years ago.	 Three hundred engineers have been battling inside a dangerzone to salvage the six-reactor Fukushima plant since it was hitby an earthquake and tsunami that also killed 7,653 people andleft 11,746 more missing in northeast Japan.	 The unprecedented multiple crisis will cost the world'sthird largest economy as much as $200 billion and requireJapan's biggest reconstruction push since post-World War Two.  	 It has also set back nuclear power plans the world over.	 Encouragingly for Japanese transfixed on work at theFukushima complex, the most critical reactor -- No. 3, whichcontains highly toxic plutonium -- stabilised after fire trucksdoused it for hours with hundreds of tonnes of water.	 Work also advanced on bringing power back to water pumpsused to cool overheating nuclear fuel, and Kyodo news agencyreported that temperatures at spent fuel pools in reactors No. 5and 6 were returning to normal.	 "We are making progress ... (but) we shouldn't be toooptimistic," said Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy-general at Japan'sNuclear Safety Agency.	   Technicians attached a power cable to the No. 1 and No. 2reactors, hoping to restore electricity later in the day priorto an attempt to switch the pumps on. 	 They aim to reach No. 3 and 4 soon after that.	 If successful, that could be a turning point in a crisisrated as bad as America's 1979 Three Mile Island accident. 	 If not, drastic measures may be required such as burying theplant in sand and concrete, as happened at Chernobyl after theworld's worst nuclear reactor disaster in 1986, though expertswarn that could take many months and the fuel had to be cooledfirst. 	 On the negative side, evidence has begun emerging ofradiation leaks from the plant, including into food and water.	 Though public fear of radiation runs deep, and anxiety hasspread as far as the Pacific-facing side of the United States,Japanese officials say levels so far are not alarming.	 Traces exceeding national safety standards were, though,found in milk from a farm about 30 km (18 miles) from the plantand spinach grown in neighbouring Ibaraki prefecture.	 The Japanese government ordered additional tests anddepending on the results may ban sales and shipments of foodproducts from areas in the vicinity of the plant.	 The first discovery of contaminated food since the March 11disaster is likely to heighten scrutiny of Japanese foodexports, especially in Asia, their biggest market. 	 Tiny levels of radioactive iodine have also been found intap water in Tokyo, one of the world's largest cities about 240km (150 miles) to south. Many tourists and expatriates havealready left and residents are generally staying indoors.	  Facing criticism of its early handling of the situation,plant operator TEPCO's president issued a publicapology for "causing such great concern and nuisance". 	 Even after restoring power, the company faces a tricky taskreactivating the cooling pumps, with parts of the systemprobably damaged from the quake or subsequent explosions.	  "The workers need to go through the plant, figure out whatsurvived and what didn't, what can be readily repaired and getthe cooling systems back up and running to deal with the coresand the spent fuel pools," said David Lochbaum, of U.S. nuclearwatchdog the Union of Concerned Scientists.	  FOREIGN ENCOURAGEMENT	 Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin recognised Japan'sprogress during a trip to reassure residents of eastern regionsthere was no immediate danger from the nuclear accident.	 "Our Japanese colleagues are gradually, not right away andwith mistakes ... getting the situation under control," he saidin the city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. "The work is being doneproperly, in the right way -- 24 hours a day."	 Putin proposed freeing up energy for Japan by increasingRussian gas supplies to Europe so more liquefied natural gas(LNG) cargoes could go to the Asian nation.	 U.N. watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)also offered encouragement to Tokyo. Its chief Yukiya Amano, whois Japanese, hailed the "strengthening" of work at the site.	 Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who has kept a low profile duringthe crisis except for shouting at plant operator Tokyo ElectricPower Co (TEPCO), sounded out the opposition about forming agovernment of national unity to deal with the crisis. 	 But the largest opposition party rejected that.	  MOVING EARTH	 Showing the incredible power of the 9.0 magnitudeearthquake, the largest to hit tremor-prone Japan since accuraterecords began in the early 1900s, Oshika peninsula in Miyagiprefecture shifted a whole 5.3 metres (17 ft) east and its landsank 1.2 metres (4 ft).	 The quake and ensuing 10-metre high tsunami devastatedJapan's north east coastal region, wiping towns off the map andmaking more than 360,000 people homeless in a test for the Asiannation's reputation for resilience and social cohesion.	 Food, water, medicine and fuel are short in some parts, andlow temperatures during Japan's winter are not helping.	 The traumatic hunt for bodies and missing people continues.	 "This morning my next door neighbour came crying to me thatshe still can't find her husband. All I could tell her was,'We'll do our best, so just hold on a little longer,'" said firebrigade officer Takao Sato in the disaster zone. 	 About 257,000 households in the north still have noelectricity and at least one million lack running water.	 Japan's crisis spooked markets, prompted a rare interventionby the G7 group of rich nations to stabilize the yen on Friday,and fuelled concerns that world economy may suffer because of disrupted supplies to auto and technology industries.	 Automaker General Motors Co said it was suspendingall nonessential spending and global travel, plus freezingproduction at a plant in Spain and cancelling two shifts inGermany while it assessed the impact of the Japan crisis.
