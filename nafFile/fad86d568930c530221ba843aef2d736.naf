<raw><![CDATA[ By Lidia Kelly and Dmitry Sergeyev MOSCOW, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The Russian Duma's financialcommittee recommended on Tuesday the expulsion from the NationalBanking Council of an outspoken banking lobbyist whose commentscaused sharp sell-offs in both the euro and rouble this year. The committee has proposed to replace Anatoly Aksakov at thecouncil with Viktor Pleskachevsky, who chairs the proprietycommittee at the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament. Thecouncil supervises the country's central bank. Aksakov -- who heads the Association of Regional Banks, oneof the two major banking lobby groups in Russia -- rattled themarket and government officials alike in early August after hecalled for a 30-40 percent devaluation of the rouble as a majorremedy for the country's faltering economy. In February, Aksakov's proposal for Russian debtrestructuring prompted a sell-off in the euro, which fell over 1percent versus the dollar. He later backtracked on thosecomments. On Tuesday, some colleagues tried to defend Aksakov, who hasbeen in the council for the past seven years and remains amember of the Duma's financial committee.  They said the move could be politically motivated asPleskachevsky is a member of the ruling United Russia party,while Aksakov is from an opposition party, Just Russia. "Now all the members of the council will be from the UnitedRussia party and there will be no counter-balance to that,"Alexei Bagaryako, a communist party deputy, told the committee. "I understand that from now on each member of the councilwho will express opinion different from that of the UnitedRussia may lose their post." The final decision lies with the Duma, where United Russiahas a majority. Alexei Makarkin, deputy head of the Centre for PoliticalTechnologies, one of Russia's oldest think-tanks, said the movewas inevitable after Aksakov called for the rouble devaluation. "Aksakov spoke his own mind - he had such a right. UnitedRussia used it against him in their political battle forvoters," he said. "United Russia used this opportunity forpolitical reasons before the upcoming regional election." Aksakov himself said that he is at peace with the news. "I don't see any problems in it for me," he told Reutersearlier in the day. However his association issued a statementsaying the council should not become a political organ. The rouble, which lost a third of its value during theperiod of gradual devaluation that ended in January, has sinceregained some strength. But for Russians the fate of thecurrency remains a sensitive issue as many remember the drasticdevaluation in 1998.
