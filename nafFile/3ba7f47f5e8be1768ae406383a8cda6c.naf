<raw><![CDATA[© Reuters.  Dollar on defensive as Fed rate hike doubts mountInvesting.com - The dollar fell against the yen and most of the other major currencies on Wednesday as weak U.S. service sector data clouded the economic outlook and raised doubts over whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell to lows of 94.68, the weakest since August 26.The dollar remained on the back foot after a report on Tuesday from the Institute for Supply Management showed that service sector activity slowed in August to its lowest level since early 2010.The weak data, coming after last week’s lackluster U.S. jobs report clouded the outlook for the U.S. economy and indicated that the Fed may hold off raising interest rates for longer.The Fed raised interest rates for the first time in almost a decade in December.Expectations of higher interest rates typically boost the dollar by making it more attractive to yield seeking investors.USD/JPY was down 0.53% at 101.47.The yen was boosted amid mounting skepticism that the Bank of Japan will roll out further easing measures at its upcoming policy review later in the month.BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda indicated Monday that he is prepared to ease monetary policy further, but also acknowledged that negative interest rates could undermine confidence in Japan's banking system.The euro was steady, with EUR/USD at 1.1249 as traders looked ahead to Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting.Sterling was weaker, with GBP/USD down 0.41% to 1.3384 after data showing that British manufacturing output fell at the fastest pace in a year in July.The report added to fears that the economy will slow in the wake of the June 23 vote to leave the European Union.             ]]></raw>
