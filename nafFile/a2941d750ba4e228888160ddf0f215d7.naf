<raw><![CDATA[  * Euro near 5-week low vs dollar on Ireland debt problems * Technical analysts looking for daily close under $1.3690 * G20 meeting under way, market sets expectations low (Adds detail, updates prices, adds comment, changes byline,dateline, previous LONDON) By Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Doubt about Ireland's abilityto repay its debts spread further on Thursday, driving the eurolower and overshadowing G20 attempts to ease currency tensionsand secure commitment to more balanced global growth. Yields on 10-year Irish bonds rose to a record high overcomparable German debt as some investors worried that Irelandwouldn't be able to cut spending as planned and may require abailout, with bond holders forced to absorb losses. The euro was down 0.5 percent at $1.3717, not far from afive-week low of $1.3670 hit a day ago, and was also loweragainst the yen, Swiss franc and sterling. "The euro can't sustain even modest upticks right now, anda fall below $1.3650 could open up another two-cent decline,"said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at BrownBrothers Harriman, who sees it at $1.33 by the end of 2010. "Europe never fully addressed these problems, and it'sclear solvency issues in Ireland have not been resolved." Traders said demand for downside options was increasing,particularly one-month $1.3200 strikes, which could push theeuro toward that level in the weeks ahead. The spike in Irish yields and decline in German ones asinvestors seek shelter in bunds has happened as U.S. yieldshave turned higher, lifted partly by a string of strong U.S.economic data, including last month's employment report. That makes holding the dollar more attractive and alsohelped it rise above 82 yen this week for the first time sinceearly October. It was last unchanged at 82.26 yen. On Wednesday the dollar rose to around 82.80 yen, just shyof 82.87, the level around which Japan intervened in Septemberto slow a multi-month yen rally. Traders cited options barriersaround 83 yen. There was still uncertainty about the dollar's medium-termoutlook, especially after the Federal Reserve said it would buysome $105 billion in Treasuries over the next 30 days. Lastweek, the Fed said it would buy $600 billion by mid-2011 in anattempt to lower U.S. interest rates and boost slow growth. "It's only the negativity surrounding the dollar that'ssaving euro/dollar from a sharper correction lower," said TomLevinson, currency analyst at ING in London. The Veterans Day holiday in the United States, where somemarkets will be shut, was helping keep the market subdued. G20 Ireland's woes and concern about debt levels in Portugaland Spain diverted traders' attention from a G20 summit inSouth Korea. Discussion was expected to include exchange ratepolicies and global economic imbalances, though agreement isunlikely and few investors expect a final statement to expandon last month's finance ministers' agreement. Much of the disagreement on currencies lies between theUnited States and China, with the former eager to see theChinese yuan appreciate at a faster pace. A senior Chinese central bank official said China had nointention to confront the U.S. over its currency rate, and thatthe issue should not be politicized. China and other countries, meanwhile, have criticized theFed's easy money policy, saying it is stoking inflation beyondU.S. borders. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday the U.S.central bank was pursuing a weaker dollar policy, prompting asharp denial from Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. "The U.S. will never do that," Geithner said in aninterview on CNBC. "We will never seek to weaken our currencyas a tool to gain competitive advantage or to grow theeconomy."
