<raw><![CDATA[   * Head of All Souls College, Oxford * Regulation and competition expert, ex Bank of England * Oversaw 2003 fine on soccer club Manchester Utd * Scrapped All Souls "one-word" essay test  By Sudip Kar-Gupta LONDON, April 10 (Reuters) - The future of Britain'spowerful banking industry is being scrutinised by one of OxfordUniversity's most prestigious professors. On Monday, Sir John Vickers will present the interim reportof the Independent Commission on Banking - a body set up by thegovernment to examine the reform of British banks after they gotbadly burnt during the credit crisis. The bespectacled academic, who turns 53 this year, iscurrently head of All Souls -- the imposing Oxford college whichonly accepts those with top first-class degrees. The interim report, which is likely to back "ring-fencing"retail banks from risky trading operations to protect ordinarysavers, will precede a definitive report in September. British Finance Minister George Osborne will then examineVickers' proposals but the April interim report could be key. For much of the last year, Vickers has travelled back andforth from Oxford to the ICB's small offices in London'sVictoria House, an art-deco edifice from the 1920s. The Vickers report may become as historic a date for Britishbanking as October 1986, when the "Big Bang" move to deregulatethe sector ushered in "universal banks" offering everything fromcomplex trading to mortgages and ordinary savings products. While the Vickers' commission is not expected to seek a fullbreak-up of these "universal banks", it is likely to askcompanies to set up separate subsidiaries for investment andretail banking. Vickers grew up in the southern England seaside town ofEastbourne. He attended Eastbourne Grammar School, where hisacademic excellence took him to Oxford University's OrielCollege. At Oriel, Vickers got a first-class degree in PPE - a coursein politics, philosophy and economics pursued by countlessBritish businessmen and politicians, such as current primeminister David Cameron. He briefly worked as a financial analyst for oil major Shellfor two years before returning to academia. Vickers held various teaching posts at Oxford, as well asvisiting positions at America's Harvard and Princetonuniversities, before joining the Bank of England in 1998. At the Bank of England, Vickers was considered by analyststo be one of the more "hawkish" members of the interest-ratesetting Monetary Policy Committee -- warning about inflation andpushing for higher interest rates in 2000.   FINING MANCHESTER UNITED Vickers left the Bank of England in 2000 for Britain'sOffice of Fair Trading, a regulatory body dealing withprotecting consumers and tackling industry competition issues. At the OFT, Vickers presided over investigations into avariety of sectors, included a 2003 probe into sportswear whichculminated in a 1.65 million pound ($2.70 million) fine forManchester United for fixing the prices of soccer kits. In 2005, Vickers also oversaw a price-fixing fine on Britishretailer GUS and asked the UK's Competition Commission to probeproposed bids for the London Stock Exchange. And in 2010, Vickers reformed the All Souls entrance exam,dubbed by some as the "hardest exam in the world", deciding thatcandidates would no longer have to write an essay based aroundone single word. "As with all these things, people have different opinionsand, like others, I feel regret when something that has beengoing on for so many years ends. But I believe this is the rightdecision," he said at the time. ($1=.6103 Pound) (Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)             ]]></raw>
