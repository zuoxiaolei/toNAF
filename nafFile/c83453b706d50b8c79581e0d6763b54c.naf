<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds quote from USTR Kirk letter) WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - A U.S. lawmaker urgedPresident Barack Obama's administration on Wednesday to bring aWorld Trade Organization case against Japan if it does not openup its cash-for-clunkers renewal program to American cars. "We cannot sit idly by while we play by the rules and allowthe Japanese cash-for-clunkers program to continue todiscriminate against our American manufacturers and workers,"Representative Betty Sutton, an Ohio Democrat, told reporters. "That's why I introduced a resolution yesterday that callsfor the U.S. Trade Representative to immediately initiatediscussions with the government of Japan to identify and remedyviolations of Japan's trade obligations," Sutton said. If those talks fail, the United States should file a formalcomplaint at the WTO, she said. Sutton released a Dec 17 letter from U.S. TradeRepresentative Ron Kirk, who said the United States wasconcerned about a recent drop in U.S. auto sales to Japan andhad urged Tokyo to give American cars more opportunity toqualify for its fleet renewal program. "We will continue to press Japan on this point ...particularly in light of the possibility that Japan may extendits purchase incentive program beyond its current terminationdate of March 31, 2010," Kirk said. That comment came after U.S. automakers Ford Motor Co,General Motors Corp and Chrysler complained that Japan'sincentive program effectively barred U.S. firms fromparticipating. In contrast, the U.S. cash-for-clunkers program was open toall auto manufacturers doing business in the United States,said Sutton, a driving force behind the legislation toencourage consumers to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles. Japanese brand autos accounted for almost half of the677,842 vehicles sold under the $3 billion U.S. program, whichran from late July to late August. Sutton said it was "too early to say" whether Congresswould revive the cash-for-clunker program in 2010. "I think it's an open question," she said.
