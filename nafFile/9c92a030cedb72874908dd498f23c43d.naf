<raw><![CDATA[ * Raw materials report boosts EU rare earth claims--sources * WTO report rebukes China on export restrictions By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck BRUSSELS, March 1 (Reuters) - Confidential World TradeOrganization findings on China's export limits on raw materialshave boosted the case for a European Union challenge to Chineseexport curbs on rare earths, sources say. "China has export restrictions on raw materials that arequestionable, according to the WTO," a source familiar with thecase said on Tuesday. "So that will be taken seriously when theEU considers China's restrictions on rare earths too." The EU's executive Commission last year started screeningthe legality of plans by China to cut back exports of rareearths, which are minerals crucial to production of high-techgoods from fibreoptic cables to smartphones and electric cars. China, whose mines supply 97 percent of the world's rareearths, says export reductions aim to protect the environmentand scarce resources -- an argument that would comply with worldtrade rules enforced by the WTO. But trade sources say a confidential, preliminary report bythe WTO found flaws in similar reasoning used by China in anongoing legal fight to defend its export restrictions on rawmaterials such as bauxite and magnesium, used to produce steel,aluminium and chemical products. The EU, United States and Mexico sued China at the WTO in2009, complaining that limiting exports of these raw materialsthrough quotas and red tape discriminated against foreignmanufacturers and gave Chinese producers an unfair advantage. The WTO -- which rarely comments on current disputes -- haspublicly questioned whether Chinese curbs on exports of some rawmaterials to conserve resources meet the stated goals or merelyfavour Chinese manufacturers. Its preliminary report, which has been handed to the partiesto the raw materials dispute, is confidential until publicationin April. Both sides can then appeal. If China loses it willhave to make amendments to export controls to avoid penalties. The United States said last month there was a possibility ofa U.S. challenge on Chinese rare earth exports at the WTO. (Editing by Mark Heinrich)             ]]></raw>
