<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro rises vs sterling, firms a touch vs dollar after Ifo * German Ifo sentiment poll hits highest in nearly 1 year * High yielders inch up as risk demand stays intact  (Recasts, changes byline, dateline pvs TOKYO) By Emelia Sithole-Matarise LONDON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The euro hit 2-1/2 month highsagainst sterling on Wednesday after an improvement in Germanbusiness morale reinforced signs that Europe's largest economywas recovering from recession. The Munich-based Ifo think tank's business climate indexrose to 90.5 from an upwardly revised 87.4 in July, beating an88.9 median forecast in a Reuters poll. The euro initially hit the day's high against the dollarafter the data, but trimmed some gains as some analysts said thedata was lower than the more bullish expectations in the market. The euro rose to 87.85 pence against the British currency,its highest level since early June. It was last seen at 87.74pence. "We tend to favour positioning for a stronger euro againstthe pound at the moment rather than the dollar," said LeeHardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ inLondon. "That's where the clearest positioning is going forwardif you want to position for an earlier euro zone recoverycompared to the UK."   LONG EURO PRE-DATA By 0902 GMT, the euro was 0.2 percent up on the day at$1.4318 against the dollar. "Everyone was expecting a good (Ifo) number and they all gota bit long of euro and euro crosses ahead of the release," aLondon-based trader said, explaining the pullback on euro. Ranges were narrow with activity still low due to theholiday season in parts of the northern hemisphere. Market participants said that a 1.78 percent rise in theShanghai stock market was supporting demand for riskier assetseven as European shares posted slight losses. Higher-yielding and commodity-linked currencies such as theAustralian dollar have gained and lost ground along withvolatile Shanghai shares recently, with many eyes on China tohelp pull the global economy out of recession. Traders said the market also wanted to see more U.S. data tofollow on from larger-than-expected gains in housing andconsumer confidence readings on Tuesday to support the view thatthe economy is on the mend. U.S. data on durable goods is due at 1230 GMT, while newhome sales will be released at 1400 GMT. "The footing of the U.S. economy is not so negative butinvestors are cautious about taking it as a trading factor,because its private consumption and jobs market remain weak,"said Kosuke Hanao, head of Treasury products sales at HSBC inTokyo. The dollar index, a gauge of the unit's performance againstsix major currencies, was little changed at 78.297. Against the yen, the dollar was 0.2 percent lower on the dayat 94.05 yen. Despite its slight gains against the dollar, the yen slippedagainst currencies considered to be high-risk, with theAustralian dollar rising as much as 0.4 percent to the day'shigh of 78.99 yen. The Australian currency was up 0.2 percent $0.8363, afterstarting the session in the red. (Additional reporting by Kaori Kaneko in Tokyo, Editing by LinNoueihed)             ]]></raw>
