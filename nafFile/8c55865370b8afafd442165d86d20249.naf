<raw><![CDATA[  * World stocks rise, along with U.S. equities * Bernanke offers no new measures to boost growth * Wall Street raises cash in preparation for Irene * Oil edges up, bonds pare gain (Updates prices, adds details, quote) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - World stocks surged and thedollar fell on Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman BenBernanke left the door open for future U.S.  economicstimulus. Speaking at the Fed's annual retreat in Jackson Hole,Wyoming, Bernanke did not offer new measures to boost theeconomy but said it was critical for the economy's health toreduce long-term joblessness. For details, see [ID:nLDE77P0JC] http://r.reuters.com/qyt43s U.S. stocks rose strongly, reversing initial losses of asmuch as 2 percent, while Treasuries, whose yields are atnear-historic lows, extended gains. Bernanke said the central bank's policy panel would meetfor two days in September instead of one to discuss additionalmonetary stimulus, offering some hope to investors for furtheraction down the road. "He didn't give the market the green light for QE3 -- healso didn't give the market the red light for QE3," said KevinCaron, market strategist at Stifel, Nicolaus in Florham Park,New Jersey, referring to the Fed's quantitative easingprogram. "By implying that inflation is viewed as not a concern, itleaves the possibility for something down the road," headded. The speech follows several turbulent weeks for markets,with investors facing concerns about another U.S. recession andescalating euro zone debt troubles, as well as a downgrade ofthe top-tier U.S. credit rating. World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index were up 1 percent, but are down 11.1 percentsince the start of the month, while Brent crude  waslast up 53 cents at $111.15 a barrel. Bernanke's speech last year laid the groundwork for theFed's $600 billion bond-buying program to revive the economyunder the rubric "QE2" for the Fed's second round of stimulus,or quantitative easing. The dollar gained on the euro after the speech but latershed those gains, with the euro  last up 0.3 percent. An increase of money supply, such as the QE2 program, tendsto erode the value of the dollar relative to other currencies. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  wasup 140.17 points, or 1.26 percent, at 11,289.99. The Standard &Poor's 500 Index  was up 17.24 points, or 1.49 percent,at 1,176.51. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 53.82points, or 2.22 percent, at 2,473.45. WALL ST PREPARES FOR IRENE Wall Street scrambled to raise cash in case Hurricane Irenecauses major disruption in trading for thousands of traders wholive in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The repurchase market, a major source of cash for WallStreet to fund trades and operations, showed an increase ininterest rates on loans that mature on Monday, a sign marketsare worried there could be disruptions - however temporary - asa result of the hurricane. Interest rates on loans backed by Treasury bonds thatexpire on Monday rose by several hundredths of a percentagepoint from late Thursday to about 0.08 percent in the $1.6trillion repurchase market. In the U.S. Treasury market, benchmark 10-year Treasurynotes  were trading 13/32 higher in price to yield2.19 percent, down from 2.21 percent late on Thursday. "I think that seeing Treasuries come off a little bit here,you're seeing some bets being unwound in the market," said RichBryant, a Treasury trader at MF Global Securities in New York. "There were some bets in the market that there was anoutside chance that something more concrete could be announcedtoday," he said. Gold was higher, fueled by safe-haven buying. Spot gold was up 0.8 percent at $1,782.99 an ounce. (Additional reporting by Ashley Lau and Emily Flitter; Editingby Dan Grebler)             ]]></raw>
