<raw><![CDATA[ * One board member suggested possible policy shift in Aug * Bank of Korea specifically targets property boom * Could be first G20 central bank to tighten since crisis * Business sentiment, import data adds to economy hopes (Updates throughout after central bank document) By Yoo Choonsik and Cheon Jong-woo SEOUL, Sept 29 (Reuters) - A South Korean central bankerraised the possibility of higher interest rates as far back asAugust, adding to evidence that Asia's fourth-largest economymay be the first G20 country to tighten monetary policy Minutes of a Bank of Korea Aug. 11 meeting show a member ofthe monetary policy committee said policymakers should considera shift away from a loose stance to curb asset price growth. Ifthe central bank raises rates, it would be the first move totighten policy since the start of the financial crisis. "Once we confirm the establishment of an economic recovery,we will be able to consider shifting the currently loosemonetary policy stance," the minutes, released on Tuesday,quoted the unidentified member as saying. "In particular, I think we need to take an especiallycareful attitude to prevent the reckless growth in asset pricesfrom leading to consumer price growth," the policymaker said. Bank of Korea Governor Lee Seong-tae also expressed hisconcern about a property boom during a news conference on thesame day, prompting investors and analysts to begin pricing inan interest rate increase later this year. Lee's hawkish comments again early this month have raisedthe possibility of the Bank of Korea becoming the first G20central bank to begin raising rates since the start of thecrisis. But all the six board members voted to keep the benchmark7-day repurchase agreement rate unchanged at a record low of2.0 percent for a sixth month, the minutes showed. The Bank of Korea does not name members in its meetingminutes unless the member insists. Data released on Tuesday by the Ministry of KnowledgeEconomy and the top business lobby showed confidence amongcompanies at its strongest in two years. Current account data, released early by the central bank,also added to optimism that Asia's fourth-largest economy wasrecovering ahead of others thanks to stimulus spending and thewon's depreciation against other currencies. PROPERTY BOOM TARGETED The current account surplus more than halved in August fromJuly as imports grew while exports shrank slightly. The importgrowth reflected a recovery in demand from consumers andcompanies. "Confidence that the economy is now recovering quite fastmust have made the Bank of Korea take a hawkish stance on thebooming property market," said Kim Jae-eun, an economist atHyundai Securities. "The board member's comments came in line with whatGovernor Lee had said and, therefore, I maintain my forecastthat the Bank of Korea will raise interest rates once thisyear," she said. But the government of President Lee Myung-bak has beenpublicly at odds with the central bank, with officialsrepeatedly warning that a hasty tightening could hamper a timidrecovery. Most analysts forecast a rate rise early next year, butmoney markets are pricing in a growing risk of a rise duringthe year, with the 1- and 3-year interest rate swap spreadnarrowing by more than 10 basis points over the past twomonths. The Bank of Korea had slashed the benchmark rate by 3.25percentage points between October and February to protect theeconomy from the crisis. It next reviews the rate on Oct. 9. Governor Lee's warnings that it was ready to raise interestrates because of a property boom came amid heating debateabroad over whether central banks should target asset pricesrather than the more traditional consumer price index.
