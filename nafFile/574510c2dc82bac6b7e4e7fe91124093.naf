Major European stock futures were up between 0.1 to 0.3percent , the euro  rose and German bond futures slipped after a surprise rise in Germany's secondquarter gross domestic product.

[ID:nN127230] Though Asian stocks gained across the board on Thursday,they were largely unchanged so far in August and investors werestill uncertain what would support equities beyond bullishsentiment. "Market sentiment has warmed up but it is not as ifinvestors are gung-ho bullish. They are still a bit jittery,"said Junichi Misawa, senior fund manager at STB AssetManagement in Tokyo. "Stocks appear to be overvalued considering the currentlevel of corporate earnings but I believe that sentiment as itis right now is indicative of a long-lasting run-up." The more positive Fed comments on the economy pushed keyU.S. stock indexes up more than 1 percent overnight, thoughshares lost steam near the end of the session. [.N] The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares traded outside Japanrose 2 percent , with the biggest gains spreadout across the consumer discretionary, energy, financials andtechnology sectors. The index has been choppy in recent weeks but is up 72percent since March 9, when a global equity rally began.

Leon Goldfeld, chief investment officer of HSBC GlobalAsset Management, believed A-shares in China held medium-termpromise. "A-shares have risen strongly year to date, some profittaking is possible. However, the underlying fundamentals thatdrive long term returns, remain robust," he said in a note. Indeed, Asia ex-Japan markets were generally still expectedto outperform, despite increasingly expensive valuations, ascapital continued to flow into the region amid growing beliefthat the global economy had turned the corner. Of the 17 additions that MSCI Inc  made to itsglobal equity indices on Wednesday, 11 of the stocks were inAsia, including five traded in Hong Kong. [ID:nN12175903] The Australian dollar rose though the shaky start inShanghai made dealers reluctant to heap more bets on thecurrency.
