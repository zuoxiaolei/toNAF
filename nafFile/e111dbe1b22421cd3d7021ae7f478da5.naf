<raw><![CDATA[ * Mexico ups gold reserves by over 90 tonnes in two months * Mexico now ranks 33rd among official holders of gold (Adds finance ministry response, link to factbox) By Dave Graham MEXICO CITY, May 4 (Reuters) - Mexico massively ramped upits gold reserves in the first quarter of this year, buyingover $4 billion of bullion as emerging economies move away fromthe ailing U.S. dollar, which has dipped to 2-1/2-year lows. The third-biggest one-off purchase of gold by any countryover the past decade took Mexico's reserves to 100.15 tonnes --or 3.22 million ounces -- by the end of March from just 6.84tonnes at the end of January, according to the InternationalMonetary Fund and Mexico's central bank. Gold has gained 11 percent this year, driven by concernover euro zone debt and the violence in the Arab world, as wellas by the U.S. dollar's 7.6 percent decline against a basket ofcurrencies . Sergio Martin, chief economist for HSBC in Mexico, said thegovernment probably saw gold as a highly liquid asset thatwould reduce exposure to the falling greenback. "They're probably thinking that getting out of dollars andinto gold makes sense because we know that the dollar has sometrend to depreciate in the near future at least," said Martin."I don't think they're going to lose money with this." According to the International Monetary Fund, LatinAmerica's No. 2 economy now owns $4.93 billion worth of gold, which hit a record $1,575.79 an ounce on Monday. The central bank did not respond to a request for comment,though Finance Minister Ernesto Cordero told reporters herespected the Bank of Mexico's decision. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Graphic on Mexico's central bank gold stocks:    http://r.reuters.com/vyz39r For a factbox on LatAM gold holdings: [ID:N04178522] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The gold purchased was worth roughly 4 percent of Mexico'sinternational foreign exchange reserves of about $126 billion. Other emerging economies such as China, Russia and Indiahave also beefed up bullion reserves over the past few years. SILVER LINING? Credit Suisse precious metals analyst Tom Kendall said itwas worthy of note that Mexico, whose economy is very closelytied to the United States, had taken this step. "The size (of the purchase) is certainly pretty chunky tohave been accomplished in that space of time. So it certainlygives another sizable layer of support to gold's position inthe international reserves system," he added. George Milling-Stanley, managing director of governmentaffairs at the World Gold Council industry group, said Mexicowas following a recent trend among central banks to restore a"prior balance between gold and currency reserves. "This is further supported by the fact that the May IMFnumbers show continued buying by Russia and Thailand of 18.8tonnes and 9.3 tonnes respectively," he added. Mexico's reserves rank it 33rd among the top officialholders of gold. The United States is the largest officialholder of gold, with 8,133 tonnes, which account for 73.8percent of its total international reserves. China is the sixth-largest holder of gold, with 1,054.1tonnes, or just 1.6 percent of total reserves, whileeighth-ranked Russia has some 811 tonnes of gold, up from788.78 in January, according to the IMF data. Silver, which hit a record price earlier this year, mayalso have been on Mexico's buying list, said HSBC's Martin. "I think Mexico has moved from second to first place in thelist of global silver producers, so they may have been buyingsilver to help the price," he added.
