<raw><![CDATA[ * BoE chief economist spies recovery but headwinds remain * Dale warns of possible asset price spike due to QE * Plays down split in MPC over level of stimulus  (Adds details) By Matt Falloon and Fiona Shaikh LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Britain appears to be emergingfrom recession and, although headwinds remain, policymakers needto be wary of driving up asset prices with loose policy, Bank ofEngland Chief Economist Spencer Dale said on Wednesday. But Dale said there was no strong evidence to suggest thatthe BoE's quantitative easing efforts were having an undesiredeffect on prices yet and played down any split within theMonetary Policy Committee over the level of stimulus needed. Last month, Dale voted against the BoE's decision to raiseits asset purchase scheme by 25 billion pounds to 200 billionpounds. He wanted to keep QE at 175 billion pounds, whileexternal member David Miles wanted a 40 billion pound rise. "The economy appears to have turned," Dale told a businessaudience in eastern England. "There is a range of evidence from business surveys, fromthe Bank's regional agents and from recent indicators, that theeconomy has begun to stabilise and that we are likely to bemoving into a period of renewed expansion." Britain's economy has suffered its longest recession onrecord, contracting 0.3 percent in the third quarter of thisyear although there have been some signs that growth may returnbefore the end of the year. Dale said fiscal and monetary stimulus, along with a weakerpound, was helping to support the recovery but cautioned thatthe economy faced headwinds from necessary structuraladjustments, with credit conditions likely to remain tight. "The recovery in the level of economic activity is likely tobe relatively slow," he said, adding that a considerablereduction in the fiscal deficit -- set to climb above 12 percentof gross domestic product this year -- was needed.  INFLATION RISKS Inflation could rise above three percent early next year,Dale said, forcing BoE Governor Mervyn King to write anexplanatory letter to the government, but the spike should betemporary. "The downward pressure from the persistent margin of sparecapacity is likely to cause inflation to fall back below the twopercent inflation target, although this pressure shouldgradually fade as the economy recovers," he said. Echoing King's comments to lawmakers last month, Dale saidit would be a mistake to read too much into any split on theMPC. "It is important not to make too much of these differences;all MPC members -- myself included -- were of the view that asignificant degree of monetary stimulus needed to be maintainedin order to meet the inflation target," he said. But Dale said his preference was to grow the economy "alittle less rapidly" to avoid the possibility that quantitativeeasing might lead to an unwarranted increase in asset prices. "I do not think there is any strong evidence to suggest thatany of the increases in asset prices seen to date are out ofline with the improving economic outlook and the desired impactof our asset purchase programme," he said. "Rather, I was conscious that the current stance of monetarypolicy ... increases the likelihood that asset prices may moveout of line with their fundamental values. It is a risk that weneed to be alert to." (Editing by Stephen Nisbet) ((UK Economics desk, uk.economics@reuters.com, Tel: +44 207 5421894))             ]]></raw>
