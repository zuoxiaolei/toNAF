<raw><![CDATA[ (Recasts lead, adds details, background) WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve andsecurities investigators are looking at how Goldman Sachs may have helped Greece disguise the size of its budgetdeficit through the use of derivatives, Fed Chairman BenBernanke said on Thursday. The surprise announcement came as Bernanke prepared tostart the second day of his semi-annual testimony on theeconomy before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee and was inresponse to concern raised by committee chairman Chris Dodd. "We are looking into a number of questions related toGoldman Sachs and other companies in their derivativesarrangements with Greece," Bernanke responded. He added the the Securities and Exchange Commission wasalso "interested" in whether other Wall Street firms had a rolein Greece's use of derivatives and in how they were used. "Obviously, using these instruments in a way thatpotentially destabilizes a company or a country iscounterproductive," Bernanke said. "We'll certainly beevaluating what we learn from the activities of the holdingcompanies that we supervise here in the U.S." In the midst of the severe financial crisis that swept theU.S. economy from 2007 to 2009, Goldman and other Wall Streetfirms converted to bank holding companies, putting supervisionof them more firmly in the Fed's hands. There has been harsh scrutiny of Goldman Sachs since Greecestaggered into a debt crisis so severe that it has raised fearsof a debt default and forced the European Union to say it willhelp if necessary to avert that. Goldman Sachs entered into currency swaps with Greece,which critics say helped it disguise its debt, and has defendedthem as neither uncommon at the time nor inappropriate. Cross-currency derivatives that Goldman Sachs conducted forGreece in 2001 helped reduce the size of its debt at a timewhen the country was keen to meet criteria for entering the EUand adopting the euro. Goldman Sachs has a particularly high profile inWashington, having produced numerous alumni including formerTreasury Secretary Henry Paulson, many of whom still playactive roles that periodically stirs the anger of lawmakers whosay it has too much influence.
