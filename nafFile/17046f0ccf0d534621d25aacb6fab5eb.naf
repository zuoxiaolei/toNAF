<raw><![CDATA[ * Plenty of catalysts to push euro lower * Risk reversals still skewed toward euro puts * Near-term euro support is at 200-day moving average (Recasts throughout; updates prices, adds comments) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The euro is likely to struggleanew in the upcoming week as markets remain fearful aboutsovereign debt issues in the peripheral euro zone economies,and investors are well-advised to be short the currency goinginto 2011. A five-notch downgrade of Ireland by Moody's and budgetwarnings by the International Monetary Fund on Friday weighedon the currency and will continue to cloud the euro's near-termoutlook. An agreement by European Union leaders to set up apermanent mechanism from mid-2013 did nothing to assuage thosefears. Investors were hoping for more aggressive solutions toaddress the region's fiscal crisis, such as increasing theEuropean Financial Stability Facility or issuing joint Europeansovereign bonds. "There are plenty of potential catalysts for the euro to golower. And we might see the euro hit $1.26 over the next twoweeks or so," said James Dailey, chief investment officer andsenior portfolio manager at TEAM Asset Strategy Fund inHarrisburg, Pennsylvania. Dailey's firm manages assets ofaround $180 million. Should the euro fall to $1.26, Dailey said he is looking tocover his portfolio's short positions. On Friday, the euro slid to a two-week low at $1.3133 and was last at $1.3181, 0.4 percent lower on theday. On the week, the euro zone currency was down 0.2 percent,although for December, it is up 1.5 percent. On the charts, immediate support for euro/dollar lies at$1.3104, the 200-day moving average. Below that level, $1.2970,the Dec. 1 low, looms. In the options market, risk reversals, a measure ofcurrency sentiment, remained skewed toward euro puts, or betsfor a currency depreciation. On Friday, the one-month 25-deltarisk reversals were at -2.375 vols , unchangedfrom the previous session. To be fair, the option market's view on the euro hasimproved over recent sessions, although risk reversals on theeuro are still way below the levels seen in mid-October, whensentiment on the currency was its most positive. BEARISH EURO CALL FROM CITIFX CitiFX, meanwhile, has put out another bearish call on theeuro, adding a 15 percent short position in its overlayportfolio and cutting dollar shorts to 5 percent from 15percent. Steven Englander, global head of FX strategy at Citi,calls this a "significant change" in the bank's positioning. Over the medium-term, Englander believes the euro zone willbe able to resolve its issues, but he says the next month maybe a "bit rough." "The lack of liquidity as year-end approaches and thedifficulties in coming up with comprehensive solutions onsovereign debt make us prefer euro shorts to longs for the timebeing," Englander said. In the United States, there is a slew of data due nextweek, all of which is expected to show the world's largesteconomy is growing, albeit at a modest pace. Two economic indicators for November, durable goods ordersand personal income/consumption, will help guide forecasts forfourth-quarter growth, with more positive news likely on theconsumer side. CIBC World Markets has recently upgraded its fourth-quarterU.S. growth forecast to 3 percent, with the downbeat Novembernon-farm payrolls data looking increasingly like an outlieramid other positive signals. These reports should keep a bid on the dollar and continueto push U.S. 10-year yields higher. TEAM Strategy's Dailey thinks the back-up in bond yields isa reflection of the acceleration of U.S. growth, all supportiveof the dollar. But he says U.S. Treasuries could rally nextweek as investors seek to "de-risk" their portfolios, but by2011, yields could rise once again. He forecasts 10-year yieldsto rise to between 4 percent and 4.5 percent by end-2011. (Editing by Dan Grebler)             ]]></raw>
