<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar rose against the yen on Monday after Japan unveiled gross domestic product growth figures that came in short of expectations, which fueled expectations that monetary policy may remain loose in the country in the near future.In U.S. trading on Monday, USD/JPY was trading at 96.55, up 0.30%, up from a session low of 95.93 and off a high of 96.92.The pair was likely to find resistance at 96.95, Friday's high, and support at 95.93, the earlier low.Preliminary data released earlier revealed that Japanâ€™s economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, falling short of expectations for 0.9% growth.Japan's gross domestic product rose 2.6% on year during the April-to-June quarter, below forecasts for an increase of 3.6%. The report softened the yen, while the dollar saw demand from investors seeking safety ahead of the release of retail sales data in the U.S. on Tuesday.Investors were hoping the data will provide insight as to when the Federal Reserve will begin tapering monetary stimulus programs.The Fed is currently buying USD85 billion in Treasury holdings and mortgage debt a month from banks to keep long-term interest rates low across the economy, a stimulus tool known as quantitative easing, which weakens the dollar as a side effect.Talk of a timetable outlining an end to stimulus could strengthen the greenback.The yen, meanwhile, was down against the pound and down against the euro, with GBP/JPY up 0.07% and trading at 149.37 and EUR/JPY trading up 0.04% at 128.47.             ]]></raw>
