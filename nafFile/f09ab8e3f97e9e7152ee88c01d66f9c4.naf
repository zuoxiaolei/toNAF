<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro rallies in aftermath of bank stress tests * Euro investors become more bullish as day progresses * U.S. new home sales data for June a positive (Updates prices, adds details) NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - The euro rallied to $1.30 onMonday as relief over European bank stress tests and strongereconomic data on both sides of the Atlantic gave investors lessreason to be risk averse. Worries the tests weren't strict enough still have someinvestors hesitant to make big bets on the single currencythough as the trading day progressed, those investors werefewer in number as they were more concerned about missing anuptrend of several days. Positive economic data in Europe has also helped lift thesingle currency recently. The dollar was lower against the yen, though earlier it hadpared some of those losses after a government report showedbetter than expected new home sales in June. For details, see[ID:nN23137243] "Despite the market's single-minded focus on the stresstests the more important story was the surprisingly strongeconomic data from the region (last week)," said BorisSchlossberg, a director for currency research at GFT in NewYork. In mid-afternoon New York trade, the euro rose as high as$1.3004 on electronic trading platform EBS  and$1.3003 on Reuters data . The currency last traded up 0.7 percent at $1.2999. Price action looked as if an options barrier was beingdefended at $1.3000, though analysts said they doubted abarrier existed given trades had breached that level on bothJuly 16th and July 20th. The level may be a psychological barrier, however, as the euro has not closed above $1.3000since early May. Fear of a euro-zone debt crisis and its impact on Europeanbanks drove the euro below $1.19 last month, its lowest levelsince 2006, but it began a swift recovery in July. That was partly driven by data showing the euro zoneeconomy has been holding up better than anticipated, even asgovernments tighten their belts to rein in large deficits. Thestress tests results, which showed only seven of 91 banksfailed, helped drive the euro further. For more on the testssee [ID:nLDE66M1T3] PUSH TOWARD $1.31 Technical analysts said the euro may still push toward$1.3125, the 38.2 percent retracement of the December-to-Junemove. It reached $1.3028 last week, according to Reuters data. Any fall in the euro was also seen limited while itremained above support at $1.2870 -- its 100-day moving average-- and last week's low around $1.2730, leaving it hemmed inwithin a range. Some said the euro's gains could also be constrained bythis week's redemption of maturing euro zone bonds and couponpayments worth some 45 billion euros, according to Citiestimates. [ID:nLDE66M1PR] "The stress tests failed to inspire much of a euro/dollarrally, but at the same time there is no reason for bears tostart selling the euro aggressively either," said RobertoMialich, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan. The euro rose to its highest since early June against theyen on electronic trading platform EBS  as dealersunwound long yen positions, but then ran into offers fromJapanese exporters around 113.30/50 yen. It was last up 0.2percent at 113.11 yen. The dollar was 0.6 percent lower at 86.90 yen , offthe session low of 86.83 yen hit before the release of thehousing data. Analysts said Monday's new home sales report was a "goodsurprise" after a string of lackluster data, but more evidencewas needed to reassure investors the economic recovery in theUnited States was still on track. "The data was pretty surprising, especially considering howpoor the numbers were last month. But the jury really is stillout," said John Doyle, senior currency strategist at TempusConsulting in Washington. "Unless you see a continued pattern of positive numbers, Ithink traders are going to be skeptical," he added. "That's whythe dollar reaction has been pretty muted." The Australian dollar rose to its highest since May 11against the U.S. dollar , as the spread between two-yearAustralian and U.S. yields rose to around a two-year high. Thegains on Monday pushed the Aussie above the 200-day simplemoving average for a second straight day. (Reporting by Nick Olivari and Vivianne Rodrigues; additionalreporting by Steven C.
