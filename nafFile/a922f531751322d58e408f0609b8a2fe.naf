<raw><![CDATA[ * Insurer to up holdings of yen bonds in 2011/12 * Will either keep risk assets or trim them * May reduce holdings of hedged foreign bonds, shif to yenbonds * No comment on Tokyo Electric shares, bonds (Adds detail, background)	 By Antoni Slodkowski and Naoyuki Katayama	 TOKYO, April 21 (Reuters) - Japan's Dai-ichi Life Insurance plans to bolster its holdings of yen bonds thisfinancial year and keep risk asset holdings steady or trim them,depending on market moves, a top executive said on Thursday.	 Japan's second-largest life insurer, with total assets of30.8 trillion yen ($373.5 billion), also said it plans to keepholdings of hedged foreign bonds steady, but it may sell themand shift back to yen bonds if overseas interest rates climb onthe back of a recovering economy in the year ending March 2012.	 "We're basically planning the same moves as last year --we'll control the pace of adding yen bonds while observinginterest rate moves," Takashi Iida, manager of Dai-ichi Life'sinvestment planning department, told Reuters in an interview.	 The insurer expects U.S. yields to gradually climb in linewith improvements in the U.S. economy, to around 4 percent nextMarch from about 3.3 percent now.	 "If foreign interest rates rise and Japanese rates staysteady, obviously the returns on hedged bonds will decrease, sowe may consider selling foreign bonds and shift to yen bonds,"Iida said.	 Lower hedging costs, or a narrower spread between Japaneseand overseas short-term interest rates, encouraged top insurersto move aggressively into hedged foreign bonds over the last twoyears as an alternative to low-yielding JGBs.	 Dai-ichi often tweaks its allocations between JGBs andcurrency-hedged foreign bonds depending on market conditions,Iida said. 	 He added the insurer wants to increase its holdings ofmostly superlong JGBs if yields rise, referring to 20- and30-year debt.	 Dai-ichi Life expects interest rates in Japan to edge up to1.4 percent from the current 1.2 percent, with public finances,further strained after the March 11 earthquake, pushing rateshigher.	 But Iida added that the Bank of Japan will likely continueits easy monetary policy, minimising the impact from strainedpublic finances on rates.	  EURO RALLY BUMPY        	 Dai-ichi added that the euro's rally, boosted byexpectations of rate increases from the European Central Bank,may not be smooth due to concerns over sovereign debt in theeuro zone's periphery countries. It predicts the euro zone willhike rates steadily, once every few months.	 It said that fiscal tightening in the euro zone may slowgrowth. Dai-ichi expects the euro to trade between 110 and 130yen in the year to March 2012. 	 The insurer also said the yen will probably weaken becausethe Bank of Japan is expected to be the last major central bankto look to exit its stimulative policies.    	 Dai-ichi Life sees the dollar trading between 80 and 95 yenthis financial year, Iida said, adding that the insurer'sforecast is for the Federal Reserve to raise U.S. interest ratesin the January-March quarter of 2012.	  REDUCING RISK	 Dai-ichi, which made its debut on the Tokyo Stock Exchangelast year following an $11 billion initial public offering,would either keep steady or trim its holdings of Japanese stocksand alternative investments, as it tries to further limit itsexposure to risky assets.	 The company said it may either sell domestic stocks or hedgevia derivatives, depending which method is cheaper. Investmentsin overseas equities will probably remain unchanged and there isno plan to reduce these holdings.	 Japanese insurers have been reducing Japanese shares formany years ahead of the introduction this financial year of newgovernment regulations that raise the risk weighting on stocksand other risky assets that insurers hold.	 Dai-ichi declined to comment on both bonds and shares ofTokyo Electric Power Co , the operator of a cripplednuclear power plant in Fukushima.	 It is one of the biggest shareholders of Tokyo Electricshares, which have tumbled 80 percent since the quake andtsunami triggered a nuclear crisis.	 Dai-ichi's shares are 16.3 percent down from pre-quakelevels, underperforming the benchmark Nikkei index's fall of 7percent.
