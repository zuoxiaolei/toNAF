<raw><![CDATA[ * Retail sales disappoint for a second month * Trade deficit widens in March, but set to narrow * Offers reason to pause on rate hikes in near term By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, May 6 (Reuters) - Australian retail sales rose asurprisingly subdued 0.3 percent in March, a second straightmonth of weakness that could give policy makers extra reason tohold off on further rate hikes in the next few months. The local dollar slipped as investors pared the chance of arate increase by August to around 60 percent, down from as muchas 85 percent earlier this week. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had already indicatedit was done for the moment after lifting its cash rate to 4.5percent on Tuesday, the fifth move in six policy meetings. "Consumers are taking a bit of a break," said SpiroPapadopoulos, an economist at National Australia Bank. "It's a sign the Reserve Bank can sit back for the next fewmonths and watch how the economy adjusts," he added. "This isfurther evidence that they don't need to go in June." Investors had already written off a move in June, giving itjust an 11 percent probability, in part because of  strains inglobal markets induced by the Greek debt crisis. Still, many analysts thought August remained in play. "The fundamentals for consumption are still improving,"noted RBS chief economist Kieran Davies. "We have strong employment, wages are growing again, houseprices are at record highs and consumer confidence at boom-timelevels," he added. "So we still suspect they will hike again inAugust after the next inflation report." The consumer price report for the second quarter is due inlate July and is likely to show inflation in the upper half ofthe RBA's 2 to 3 percent target band. The sluggishness in retail sales for March certainly cameas a surprise to analysts who had expected a rebound of around0.8 percent, following February's sharp 1.2 percent decline. SPENDING WITH CAUTION Thursday's data showed retail sales rose a meagre 0.1percent in the whole first quarter when adjusted for inflation,implying hardly any contribution to economic growth. That is important as retail sales account for around 23percent of Australia's GDP and the retail sector is the biggestemployer with about 15 percent of all jobs. In a recent speech RBA Governor Glenn Stevens noted thatconsumers were being more cautious in their spending than inpast recoveries and that might stop the economy from becomingtoo hot. Instead, the central bank has its eyes on a coming boostfrom huge rises in prices for coal and iron ore, Australia'stwo biggest exports.  Thus while figures out Thursday showed Australia's tradedeficit widened in March to A$2.08 billion ($1.9 billion),analysts expect the shortfall to narrow sharply in comingmonths as those price increases feed through. The central bank's index of Australian commodity prices thisweek provided a taste of what was to come. The index surged15.1 percent in April alone and further gains are expected asthe increases in contract prices are phased in. The central bank now expects Australia's terms of trade -what it gets for exports compared to what it pays for imports -to revisit the record highs of 2008, a marked upgrade from justa few months ago. That should shower money on the economy, from profits toinvestment, wages and tax receipts. "The 15 percent jump in commodity prices in April should goclose to pushing the trade position back to balance, and overtime, we expect to see trade surpluses emerge," said ScottHaslem, chief economist at UBS. That is one reason he expects interest rates to rise toaround 5 percent by year-end and further into 2011. (Editing by Tomasz Janowski)             ]]></raw>
