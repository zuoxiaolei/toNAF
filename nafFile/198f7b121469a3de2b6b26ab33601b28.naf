<raw><![CDATA[ TOKYO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The dollar jumped suddenly againstthe yen on Monday, prompted by speculation of intervention byJapanese authorities, but then gave up the gains very quickly astraders cited talk that there might have been a technical glitchrather than intervention. A Ministry of Finance official declined to comment on thesudden move in dollar/yen, which had fallen within range of itspost-war record low of 79.75 yen. "There is talk that it was intervention but it doesn't seemlike the market is heating up that much. There hasn't been anyconfirmation," said a trader for a Japanese brokerage house. "Since it looked like the market may test the 80.00 yen levelthis morning, it would not be strange to see the kind of actionto check such moves," the trader said. Others said, however, there was also talk in the market of amiss-hit or technical problem which had led traders to believethat Japanese authorities had intervened. There was one episode recently when traders had suspectedintervention but it just turned out to be fund operators buyingback the dollar, so it is hard to tell, the trader said. The dollar leapt more than 1 yen to 81.60 yen very quickly inearly trade but rapidly gave back some of its gains to trade at80.67 yen, up 0.4 percent on the day. The market is wary that Japanese authorities could intervenethe closer the dollar falls to its post-war record low of 79.75yen. Japanese authorities intervened to sell yen for the firsttime since 2004 on Sept. 15, intervening repeatedly through theAsian, European and U.S. trading day to drive the dollar up froma 15-year low.
