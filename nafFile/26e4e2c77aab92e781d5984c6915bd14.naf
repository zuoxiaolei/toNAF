<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar struggles before U.S. payrolls, euro edges up * Markets positioned for weak reading of U.S. jobs market * Median forecasts for 100,000 job losses (Adds detail, updates prices)  By Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The dollar struggled on Fridaywhile the euro crept up before U.S. employment data which isexpected to show more job losses and may fuel dollar selling butalso heighten risk aversion. Reflecting low appetite for risk due to worries about aslowdown in the U.S. and global economies, the yen was lockednear a 15-year high against the dollar and the Swiss franchovered within range of a record peak against the euro. Data due at 1230 GMT is expected to show U.S. non-farmpayrolls fell 100,000 in August, following a loss of 131,000 inJuly. Figures earlier in the week showed a surprising decreasein private sector jobs last month. Currencies were little changed in early European trade, asinvestors were wary of taking on big positions ahead of the jobsdata. Market participants said traders were short of dollarsheading into the figures.  "If the figure does not provide a massive surprise to theupside, it will support the market's view that the Fed will notraise rates for a very long time," said Ulrich Leuchtmann,currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. He added that this would also raise speculation the Fed mayimplement more quantitative easing to boost the economy, whichwould be negative for the dollar. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has said he is prepared to easemonetary policy further if the U.S. economic slowdown worsened. Some in the market said a weak jobs reading may increaserisk aversion, which could drive the euro and growth-linkedcurrencies lower. By 0926 GMT, the euro was little changed on the day at$1.2835, hovering near a two-week high around $1.2855 hitearlier in the week. Traders said the single currency's upsidewas capped by offers from semi-official European names.  Stop-loss orders seen at $1.2850 were limiting euro moves,while option expiries later in the day were littered in the$1.2800-$1.2900 region.  DOLLAR/YEN UPSIDE RISK? The dollar was a touch lower on the day against a basket ofcurrencies at 82.363. The U.S. currency inched up to 84.40 yen, but hovered inrange of a 15-year low of 83.58 yen hit late last month. "There are said to be some stop-losses and option triggersaround 83.50. So it could get ugly if the dollar/yen hits thatlevel after the payroll data," said Teppei Ino, an analyst atMitsubishi-Tokyo UFJ Bank in Tokyo. The euro rose to 0.3 percent to 1.3030, but it stayed inrange of an all-time low of 1.2850 earlier this week. The dollar was at 1.0150 francs, up 0.2 percent. Investors often favour the low-yielding yen and Swiss francwhen they want to avoid losses rather than seek higher returns. The U.S. dollar was slightly higher at C$1.0544, recoveringfrom the day's low C$1.0519 hit after Russia's central bank saidwill soon be ready to invest its currency reserves in Canadiandollars. Traders have cited growing demand for short-dated options tobuy dollar/yen this week, suggesting investors are keen toprotect their short dollar positions against sudden bounces eventhough they see the greenback staying weak. As a result, options traders said risk reversals, thepremium required to hold a put or a call in a currency, areskewed towards yen puts in the one-week tenor at around 0.6,shifting from 1.0 in favour of yen calls a week ago. Investors have become cautious about bidding the yen toomuch after Japanese ministers said they could take action --normally a code word for intervention -- to stem yen strength.(additional reporting by Tokyo Forex Team, editing by NigelStephenson)              ]]></raw>
