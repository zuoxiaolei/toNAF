But with the surplus still hefty and export growth also wellinto double-digit territory, there will likely be little easingin foreign calls for China to let its currency rise more quickly. "The trade surplus is smaller than expected, but pressurefrom the United States for yuan revaluation will remain strongbecause it is an election year," said Thio Chin Thio, a currencystrategist with BNP Paribas in Singapore. Beijing did what it could to cast the latest figures in aflattering light ahead of a U.S. decision due on Friday aboutwhether to formally declare for the first time that Chinamanipulates its currency. In its release of the data, the General Administration ofCustoms noted that the trade surplus was at a five-month low andthat month-on-month import growth hit a record high. "Stronger-than-expected import growth shows that China'seconomy is increasingly relying on its internal strength, whichis a result that Beijing wants to see," said Xu Jian, aneconomist with CICC in Beijing. Import growth slowed to 24.1 percent in September comparedwith a year earlier, well below August's 35.2 percent rise butahead of market forecasts of a 23.7 percent increase. Annual export growth slowed to 25.1 percent in September from34.4 percent in August, narrowly missing forecasts of a 25.5percent rise. That left China with a trade surplus of $16.9 billion, stillsizeable but down from $20.0 billion in August and below themedian forecast of $18.0 billion. FODDER FOR DEBATE There was enough in the data for people on all sides of theyuan debate to ensure that China's exchange rate policy willremain in the spotlight for now. "Note that $145 billion in exports is only a fraction belowthe July record high, so there will be plenty of ammunition forthose pushing China on the yuan at the G20 meetings," said SeanCallow, a currency strategist with Westpac in Sydney. A G20 summit in Seoul in mid-November and U.S. Congressionalmidterm elections earlier that month are sensitive politicaldates, before which many analysts believe China will push throughfaster yuan appreciation to blunt foreign criticism. The U.S. House of Representatives last month passed a measuredirected at China that could allow the United Sates to slapduties on imports from countries with exchange rates that areheld at unfairly low levels. A smaller Chinese trade surplus is seen as an essentialcomponent of rebalancing that is needed to put the global economyon sounder footing. While foreign critics often emphasise the importance of astronger yuan in achieving that goal, Beijing's retort is thatthis focus is too narrow. It says that a broader series ofreforms, such was building up the country's welfare system, willover time encourage more domestic consumption. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said last week that the UnitedStates and the European Union should stop piling pressure onChina to revalue its currency, warning that a rapid rise wouldpummel exporters and unleash disastrous social turmoil. Nevertheless, China has let the yuan rise more quickly inrecent weeks, making for a total appreciation of 2.3 percentagainst the dollar since the currency was unshackled from anearly two-year peg on June 19.
