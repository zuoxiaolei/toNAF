<raw><![CDATA[ (adds quotes, detail) By Natsuko Waki DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 28 (Reuters) - China is making aprogress in balancing its trade position as companies targetdomestic consumers, and its trade surplus will fall to $150billion this year, China's central bank adviser said. Data earlier this month showed Beijing's efforts to raiseimports to be bearing fruit -- its surplus with trading partnersnarrowed for the second straight year in 2010 to $183 billionfrom a peak of $300 billion in 2008. Li Daokui, academic adviser to the People's Bank of China,also said the country's adjustment in nominal exchange rateswould affect general trade but not processed trade, where Chinaassembles goods made elsewhere and exports them. "It's my personal forecast that trade surplus will go downto $150 billion... The trade surplus is now just above 3 percentbut it will go down to 2 percent this year and even below 1percent in 2-3 years," Li said on the sidelines of the annualWorld Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos. "We have a labour shortage and the export sector is changingitself, to sell more domestically... be it fishing, homeappliances or automobile sectors." China has repeatedly pledged to balance its trade account byimporting more, in part due to pressure from trade partners topull more weight as a consumer, and as it seeks to reduce itseconomic dependence on exports.Efforts to raise imports are paying off, with China's globaltrade surplus narrowing in 2010 for the second straight yearfrom $196 billion in 2009. In a panel discussing China's exchange rate policy at theDavos forum on Friday, some Chinese panellists clashed withWashington policy-watchers who urged Beijing to move faster tostrengthen the yuan. Yu Yongding, former PBOC adviser and influential economistin the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a governmentthink-tank, said inflationary pressures will likely lead to afaster rate of appreciation in the yuan."China is facing inflationary pressures. It's extremelyrational to have a faster appreciation. It's in China'sinterest," he said. Li said that in China market forces are already playing apart in adjusting imbalances but a big-bang appreciation of, forexample, 20 percent was unlikely to help as exporters still hadto sell abroad.
