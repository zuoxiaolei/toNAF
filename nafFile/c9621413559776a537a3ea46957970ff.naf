<raw><![CDATA[ * Spending stays high, revenue falls sharply * Budget deficit biggest on record * Deficit, debt to fall gradually to not hurt recovery * GDP seen shrinking 1.9 pct in 2009, 1.5 pct growth in 2010  (Adds details, comments from finmin interview) By Gordon Bell CAPE TOWN, Oct 27 (Reuters) - South Africa's government willkeep spending to steer its way through its first recession innearly two decades, but it defied political pressure by pledgingon Tuesday to cut a record budget gap as the economy recovers. The government and utilities will press on with massiveinfrastructure spending, while earmarking money for fightingpoverty through welfare and for public works programmes andcompany incentives to help cut stubbornly high unemployment. Investors are watching for signs of any departure from apreviously conservative fiscal stance in Africa's biggesteconomy due to the growing prominence of more left-leaningleadership in the ruling ANC and its trade union allies, sinceJacob Zuma became president this year. Zuma is under pressure from new left-leaning cabinetministers and unions to introduce anti-poverty measures andloosen fiscal policies that saw budget surpluses and smalldeficits during a decade of strong economic growth. But analysts said the budget numbers showed prudence had wonthe day. The medium term budget statement put the 2009/10deficit at 7.6 percent -- double a forecast from February -- butpromised a fall to 6.2 percent of GDP in 2010/11 and 4.2 percentby 2012/13. "They have secured their credibility with greater constraintin spending and some savings and efficiency measures," PeterAttard Montalto, emerging markets economist, at Nomura said. The deficit jump was expected given lower tax revenue due tothe recession and analysts had been watching for evidence thebig shortfall would not stay for long. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said spending would stayrelatively high for now but vowed to avoid unsustainable debt.[ID:nLR310346] [ID:nLR092506] "We will be diligent in the management of the publicfinances, and not burden future generations unduly," he told parliament in his first budget announcement since hisappointment in May. He told Reuters in an interview the Treasury wanted to cutthe deficit faster, depending on economic conditions. "What we have done is created a situation where there is noambiguity about our intent and now we have got to see what thesituation allows us to do," Gordhan said.  POVERTY  South Africa has seen some of the biggest popular protestsin a year of global economic crisis, though, and Gordhan saidthe fight against poverty would be stepped up. "We also recognise that vulnerability and poverty aredeep-rooted, and these structural challenges require sustained,broad-based transformation of our economy, beyond the presentrecovery," Gordhan said. The Treasury said the gap would ease gradually, withborrowing staying relatively high to help ensure a sustainableeconomic recovery from this year's forecast 1.9 percentcontraction. The Treasury said the government would retain acountercyclical fiscal policy, spending more when times were badand reducing debt when they were good. "Higher borrowing is, however, only a temporary solution,"the Treasury said. "Over the medium term, the deficit will haveto be reduced gradually."  SLUGGISH  The Treasury saw the economy emerging from recession in thefourth quarter of this year with signs that the hard-hit miningand manufacturing sectors may have turned the corner. But recovery would be sluggish and uneven, with growth notseen bettering 2008's 3.1 percent before 2012, a slower reboundthan in other countries. The economy was expected to grow 1.5percent in 2010 and 2.7 percent in 2011. Years of expansion had helped South Africa cut officialunemployment to just over 20 percent but output has plunged inthe last year and about half a million jobs have disappeared. Relatively loose fiscal and monetary policy should supportthe recovery, although higher electricity costs and wages wouldkeep pressure on inflation, with consumer inflation only seen inthe 3 to 6 percent band, on average, in 2012, the Treasury said. The target remains in place for now, despite fiercecriticism from the ruling ANC's trade union and communist partyallies, but the debate would escalate. "At this stage, we see no reason to change the inflationtarget. We do want to signal, however, that the world over,there is a fair amount of debate, which we are monitoring,"Gordhan said, adding talks would be held soon with the centralbank. The rand  fell after the statement and on comments,similar to those from the central bank, that the Treasury wasworried about its more than 20 percent jump this year.[ID:nWEA6971] Gordhan said the government would have liked to haveintervened more to curb its rise, by boosting reserves, if thathad been more affordable.(Additional reporting by Stella Mapenzauswa and WendellRoelf; Editing by Patrick Graham)             ]]></raw>
