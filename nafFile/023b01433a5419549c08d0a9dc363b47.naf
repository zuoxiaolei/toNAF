<raw><![CDATA[ * G20 agrees list of indicators of imbalances without forex * China prevents exchange rate and reserves criteria   (Adds debate on indicators, growth, inflation) By Louise Egan and Daniel Flynn PARIS, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Finance ministers of the world'smajor economies reached a fudged accord on Saturday on how tomeasure imbalances in the global economy after China preventedthe use of exchange rates and currency reserves as indicators. French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, who chaired theGroup of 20 talks, said the deal nevertheless represented asignificant step towards better coordination of economicpolicies worldwide to help prevent another financial crisis. "It wasn't simple. There were obviously divergent interestsbut we were able to reach a compromise on a text that seems tous to be both balanced and demanding in its implementation," shetold a news conference. Ministers and central bank governors agreed on a list ofindicators including public debt and fiscal deficits, privatesavings and borrowing, the trade balance and other components ofbalance of payments such as net investment flows. But at Chinese insistence there was no mention of the realeffective exchange rate or of foreign currency reserves. "Reserves have been dropped," Lagarde acknowledged, addingthat the deal included a mechanism to take account of exchangerates when assessing the overall balance of payments. The United States and other western countries accuse Beijingof keeping the yuan artificially undervalued to boost itsexports, hence accumulating massive foreign currency reservesthat they say distort the world economy. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner repeated after thetalks that China's currency "remains substantially undervalued"and its real exchange rate had not moved much despite a slowappreciation since a reform last June. "There is broad consensus that the major economies, not justEurope, Japan and the United States but also the large emergingeconomies, need to allow their exchange rates to adjust inresponse to market forces," he said. The world's number two economy, which overtook Japan thisweek, has resisted Western pressure to substantially revalue itscurrency to help rebalance global growth. China's trade surplus has shrunk of late, perhaps explainingwhy it prefers that measure. Western and Japanese officials said the indicators would inpractice cover balance of payments and foreign reserves, even ifthose terms had been omitted to assuage Beijing. Chinese FinanceMinister Xie Xuren left without speaking to reporters. "We needed to be inventive about wording in the communiquein consideration for a country that did not want to use the term'current account balance'... The statement lists components ofthe current account balance," Japanese Finance MinisterYoshihiko Noda told reporters.  NO SPECIFIC GOALS Lagarde said the indicators were not binding targets butwould lead to the drafting of guidelines for coordinatedeconomic policies to reduce distortions, and then to a mutualassessment process. Germany, Europe's biggest exporter, which has resisted U.S.efforts to set numerical targets for current account surpluses,said no specific goals would be set for certain indicators. The G20 ministers acknowledged that economic recovery wasdiverging between developed and developing economies, but theydiffered in their assessment of global inflation risks. The communique noted that while growth was subdued in mostdeveloped economies, with unemployment high, major emergingmarkets were roaring ahead, "some with signs of overheating". European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet saidinflationary pressures coming from energy and commodities pricesmust be taken seriously, and the ECB was determined to avoidsecond-round effects on wages. But Geithner said inflation risks in the United States weremoderate. French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who holds the G20presidency this year, urged ministers on Friday not to getbogged down by the indicators dispute and welcomed the fact thatChina had agreed to host a seminar on reforming theinternational monetary system in Shenzhen in late March. France has also run into opposition with its two other G20priorities -- greater transparency and regulation of commoditiesprices and reform of the international monetary system. The G20 communique said ministers agreed to work onstrengthening the international monetary system to help avoiddisruptive fluctuations in capital flows and disorderlymovements in exchange rates. China and Brazil complain that "hot money" inflows riskdestabilising the economies of emerging countries, pointing thefinger at the U.S. Federal Reserve's money printing via a $600billion bond purchase programme. With world shares at 30-month highs, investors seem contentfor the G20 to take its time, whereas at the height of thecrisis two years ago markets were baying for policy action.
