<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro falls as euphoria over ECB bond buying fades * Dollar falls versus Swiss franc, yen after S&P downgrade * Markets on alert for intervention by Japan, Switzerland (Updates prices, adds comment, details, changes byline,dateline, previous LONDON) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Monday onfears the European Central Bank's buying of Spanish and Italiandebt would not stem the spreading debt crisis, while the dollardropped against the Swiss franc and yen after the U.S. debtrating cut. Traders said the ECB bought Spanish and Italian debt earlyin the European session after it said on Sunday it would"actively implement" its bond-buying program. That helped liftthe euro to a high above $1.44 earlier. See [ID:nL6E7J704K] But the ECB purchases did little to alleviate concerns thatthe euro zone's debt crisis is spreading to core countries.Nervousness in global financial markets after Standard & Poor'scut the United States's AAA sovereign rating on Friday alsoprompted investors to shed risk and pressured the euro. "The complete unwind of the euro/dollar rally before theopen of North American trade speaks volumes about the currencymarket's fear of the euro zone credit crisis," said BorisSchlossberg, director of currency research at GFT in New York. "Today's price action is shaping up as a battle ofconfidence between central banks and the bond vigilantes whichcontinue to press the credit markets in Spain, Italy andperhaps France next," he added. Five-year credit default swaps on French government debtrose 15.5 basis points to 160 basis points -- a record high --according to data monitor Markit. This means it costs 160,000euros to protect 10 million euros of exposure to French bonds. The euro  last traded at $1.4174, near a sessionlow of $1.4150 on trading platform EBS and well off a sessionpeak of $1.44320. Traders see the next downside target aroundFriday's low at $1.4055. Support is seen around $1.4030, theeuro/dollar's 200-week moving average. The euro fell 1.2 percent against the safe-haven Swissfranc , near a record low. It also lost 1.7 percentversus the yen . Trading in the euro remained volatile, with one-montheuro/dollar implied vol  rising to 14.25, whileone-month risk reversals , which track the skewbetween options to buy or sell the currency, remained stronglyin favor of selling euros. RISK AVERSION The dollar  fell 0.8 percent to 77.79 yen, havingslipped to around 77.45 on EBS. It was down 0.5 percent at0.7635 Swiss francs , in sight of a record low around0.7480 plumbed earlier in the day. Wall Street stocks tumbled after the U.S. debt downgraderattled investors already nervous a global economic slump. Goldhit a new record high above $1,700 an ounce. The world's industrial powers pledged on Sunday to takewhatever actions were needed to steady financial markets. "The perception in markets is increasingly that centralbanks do not have the tools to solve the problems the advancedeconomies face and that worse the response to date might havecaused more harm than good," said Camilla Sutton, seniorcurrency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. Some analysts said the S&P downgrade highlighted the viewthat the dollar will remain weak and that they saw room for theU.S. currency to depreciate more than the euro versus a rangeof currencies. "Our hunch is that the external pressure on the euro is alot less than the external pressures on the dollar," saidThomas Stolper, currency strategist at Goldman Sachs. "As soon as there is a loss of confidence (in the U.S.),foreigners stop buying U.S. assets. It's also the same as inEurope, but the U.S. has a large current account deficit tofund, whereas Europe doesn't." Goldman held its euro/dollar forecast at $1.45 for the nextthree months, while it expects the pair to hit $1.50 in sixmonths. It lowered its three-month dollar/yen forecast to 77yen from 82, and sees the dollar falling to 74 yen in a year. Demand for the franc and the yen kept alive the threat ofintervention by Swiss and Japanese authorities to weaken theircurrencies, whose strength eats into their exports. Market participants expect Japanese authorities willre-enter the market if the dollar falls to 77.10 yen -- thelevel at which it sold yen for dollars last week.
