Gross domestic product rose 0.2% in the third quarter, from the previous three months, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. Analysts had expected GDP to rise 0.4% in the quarter. The statistics bureau also revised second-quarter growth to 1.1% from 1.2%. Exports fell 2.4% in the quarter, the steepest drop since the second quarter of 2003 the report showed. Construction declined 0.9% from the prior quarter.The data further damped speculation of a near-term interest rate rise by the Reserve Bank of Australia.Meanwhile, the Aussie was down against the euro, with EUR/AUD rising 0.27% 1.3576.Later in the day, the U.S. was to release a report on ADP non-farm employment change, as well as official data on manufacturing activity.
