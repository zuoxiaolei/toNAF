<raw><![CDATA[ LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Plans by France andGermany to improve economic competitiveness in the euro zonerisk creating a "two-speed Europe" that closes the door tonon-euro countries, the bloc's budget chief said on Wednesday.	 In an interview with Britain's Times newspaper, JanuszLewandowski urged core euro zone members to involve otherEuropean Union countries in talks to strengthen governance.	 "Developments are being watched with some nervousness inWarsaw and other capitals," he told The Times.	 "We need a discussion on how to avoid a two-speed Europe."	 Germany and France, the two biggest euro zone economies, arehoping to win back market confidence in the bloc's publicfinances through a "pact for competitiveness."	 The measures they want the euro zone and other countries tosign up to include a higher retirement age and limits on debtlevels.	 Lewandowski said the impression at the moment is that "thedoor to this internal club could be closed."	 He said one solution may be "partial affiliation" to theeuro zone so that future members can benefit from financialstability mechanisms.	 Countries which have said they will eventually join theeuro, such as Hungary and Poland, "should feel like they arepart of discussion over the future of the euro zone, becausethis is their destination," Lewandowski said.	 "It is very difficult to have the door to the euro zonehalf-open for non-eurozone countries."	 (Reporting by Karolina Tagaris; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)  	             ]]></raw>
