<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen rallies as stocks slip, dealers trim bearish bets * Aussie down as CPI dents expectations of bigger rate hike * Norges Bank expected to raise rates (Updates prices, adds comment and quotes, changes byline anddateline. pvs TOKYO)  By Jamie McGeever LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The yen strengthened across theboard and the Australian dollar fell on Wednesday as Australianinflation data and broad weakness in global stocks promptedtraders to trim positions and reduce risk exposure. Australian consumer price inflation was generally in linewith forecasts but not strong enough to justify expectations foran aggressive interest rate increase next week, which pushed theAustralian dollar to a two-week low. This followed surprisingly weak U.S. consumer confidencefigures on Tuesday which also dampened investor appetite forriskier assets. The dollar index, a broad measure of the greenback's valueagainst six currencies, was flat. The dollar was down againstthe yen but gained ground against commodity currencies, and wasflat against the euro and sterling. "The Nikkei is weaker and this increase in risk aversionusually benefits the yen, although this kind of correlation hasbeen be waning a bit recently," said Johan Javeus, strategist atSEB in Stockholm. Japanese stocks fell 1.35 percent and European shares openedlower. Javeus also cited profit-taking from the dollar's rise to aone-month high against the yen earlier this week. The dollar fell 0.7 percent to 91.13 yen, retreating from aone-month high of 92.33 yen hit on EBS the previous day. The spread of 10-year U.S. Treasury yields over Japanesegovernment bond yields shrank to 203 basis points from as muchas 215 bps the previous day after a well-received U.S. 2-yearnote auction. This also weighed on dollar/yen. The euro fell 0.7 percent to 135.05 yen, pulling back from amore than two-month high of 138.49 yen hit on trading platformEBS on Monday. The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against sixmajor currencies, was little changed at 76.12, holding close toa two-week high of 76.328 on Tuesday. The euro was unchanged on the day at $1.4812, not makingmuch headway after falling to a two-week low of $1.4769 theprevious day as investors trimmed long positions afterdisappointing U.S. consumer confidence figures. It had hit a 14-month high of $1.5064 on Monday.  EYES ON NORWAY  The Australian dollar was down 0.8 percent on the day at$0.9090, and overnight interest rate swaps markets showedinvestors now looking for no more than a 25 basis point raterise at the Reserve bank of Australia's meeting next week. "We've had an almost uninterrupted increase in the Aussiedollar since the end of June, and an acceleration of that movein October, so there's bound to be a lot of profit-taking,"Javeus said. Attention in Europe is on Norway, with Norges Bank expectedto become the first European central bank to raise interestrates since the global financial and economic crisis. A quarter point rate rise to 1.5 percent is so widelyanticipated that traders sold the Norwegian crown against theeuro on Wednesday, cashing in on its sharp rise to a 14-monthhigh earlier this month. "This outcome is well anticipated so the relevant questionis whether or not the tone will turn significantly more hawkish,suggesting an acceleration of the tightening cycle. We don'tthink this will be the case," said Societe Generale strategistsin a note to clients. The euro was last up slightly at 8.38 crowns. Earlier thismonth it fell below 8.25 crowns for the first time since Augustlast year.
