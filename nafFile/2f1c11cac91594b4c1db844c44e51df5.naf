<raw><![CDATA[ * Moody's changes outlook to positive from stable * Raises GDP growth forecast to 6.5 pct for 2010, 5 pct 2011 * Says upgrade rests on improving fiscal fundamentals * Central bank says inflation will moderate in Q4 * Turkish bond yields fall, lira firms  (Adds RBS analyst's quote, updates yield on benchmark bond) By Thomas Grove ISTANBUL, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Moody's revised its outlook topositive on Tuesday for Turkey's Ba2 local and foreign currencydebt, citing improved economic and fiscal resilience, in a movethat boosted Turkish bonds and the lira currency. The credit ratings agency said in a statement that it hadalso raised its forecasts of GDP growth to 6.5 percent this yearand 5 percent in 2011, and as a consequence the country'sdeficit and debt levels have improved beyond the targets set inthe government's 2010-12 Medium-Term Plan.  "Turkey's economy has proven to be unexpectedly robust andhas recovered to pre-crisis levels," Sarah Carlson, Moody'svice-president and lead sovereign analyst for Turkey, said in astatement. Carlson said a potential upgrade to Ba1 depended upon afurther strengthening of fiscal fundamentals, particularly inlight of Turkey's external vulnerabilities, such as its largecurrent account deficit and its reliance on portfolio investmentflows, rather than foreign direct investment, to fund thecurrent account deficit. "The challenge now is for Turkey to once again registerlarger primary surpluses and continue to reduce its debt levelsin order to further bolster its resilience to external shocks,"Carlson said. Markets reacted bullishly to Moody's improved outlook. The yield on Turkey's April 25, 2012 benchmark bond fell to7.99 percent from a previous level of 8.05 percent. The lira firmed to 1.45 against the dollar on the interbankmarket from a previous level of 1.4525. Turkey is expected to hold a general election in June nextyear, when Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party will seek athird consecutive term in power, having already overseen aperiod of unprecedented economic growth. "Given Moody's is still one notch below Fitch and twonotches from investment grade, the increase in the outlook topositive from stable is still a half-hearted move, especially asCDS levels have been pricing in an investment grade for sometime now," Simon Quijan-Evans, analyst at C.A. Cheuvreux, said. "Nevertheless, any move from ratings agencies ahead of nextyear's elections should be taken well by markets, given itunderlines the investment case versus peers in Eastern andWestern Europe," he added. While Moody's rates Turkey at Ba2, Standard & Poor's has thecountry on a BB rating, both two notches below investment grade,while Fitch has Turkey at BB+, just one notch below investmentgrade. Many analysts argue that Turkey's economic fundamentalsdeserve an investment grade rating. "In my view, there is absolutely no justification why Turkeyshould be rated one notch below Egypt, and it is franklyludicrous that Turkey is rated behind the EU's weak links, i.e.Hungary, Latvia and perhaps even Romania," Timothy Ash, of RoyalBank of Scotland, wrote in a note. Ash saw Moody's possibly upgrading Turkey within a couple ofmonths to remove the anomaly in its ratings, otherwise it willbecome caught in the election cycle. The Turkish Central Bank on Tuesday supplied furtherpositive news, saying it expects inflation to gradually declinebeginning in the fourth quarter. Consumer prices rose 1.23 percent in September, and 9.24percent on an annual basis, accelerating from 8.33 percent inAugust.
