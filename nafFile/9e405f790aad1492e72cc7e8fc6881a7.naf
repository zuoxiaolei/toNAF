<raw><![CDATA[  * Dollar gains as stocks rally, Treasury yields rise * Worries about euro zone debt continue to haunt euro * Friday's U.S. jobs, Bernanke remain key (Adds quote, updates prices) By Julie Haviv NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher againstthe euro on Monday, aided by a jump in global stock markets andrising Treasury yields. Thin trading due to holidays in Tokyo and London added tovolatility in the euro, but the dollar was expected tooutperform the single currency as concerns about some euro zonenations' ability to sell debt top investor worries. "There are plenty of factors that should weigh on the euroover the near-term while the dollar should continue to benefitfrom strong economic data," said Mark McCormick, currencystrategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. Wall Street stocks surged more than 1 percent as the newtrading year kicked off and the rally of late 2010 resumed onencouraging signs about the economic outlook and a seasonaleffect. For more, see: [ID:nN03185820]. U.S. Treasury yields, which move inversely to price, rose,though investors may wait until after Friday's U.S. jobs datato bet on yields heading much higher. [ID:nN03185316]. Rising yields tend to support the dollar as they reflectstronger growth. They also enhance the attractiveness of somedollar-denominated assets to investors. In late afternoon New York trading, the euro fell to$1.3365  against the dollar, down 0.09 percent on theday, but above the session's low of $1.3251, according toReuters data. Also weighing on the euro were worries about the ability ofcertain euro zone countries to sell an abundance of debt.Portugal is expected to refinance 11 billion euros worth ofdebt and Spain 32 billion euros worth in the first quarter,according to BBH's McCormick. "If we continue to see strong economic data, the euro bythe end of the week should drop to the $1.32 range against thedollar. But if Friday's payrolls report disappoints, the euroshould reach the $134.50 range against the dollar," he said. Manufacturing in the United States and Europe acceleratedin December, while growth in China and India slowed to a moresustainable level, helping to fuel a move by investors intoriskier assets. [ID:nN03178029] The data helped the euro outperform some currencies. Itrose 0.64 percent against sterling to 86.27 pence  andgained 0.45 percent versus the yen to 109.12 yen . The dollar rose 0.63 percent against the yen to 81.66 yen. The dollar was down 0.05 percent against the Swiss franc to0.9330 francs , after dropping to an all-time low of0.9301 on Friday. The euro was down 0.16 percent against theSwiss franc at 1.2468 francs , still some distanceaway from its record low at 1.2398 francs hit last week. Greg Anderson, senior currency strategist at CitiFX in NewYork, said markets are "expecting further U.S. economicoutperformance in the first quarter," which would bedollar-positive. He also expects further losses in the euro starting thisweek "until the market is satisfied with the outcomes forPortugal and Spain." Anderson added that the currency market will more or lesshave the same theme as last year, "with the euro being sold offbecause of the euro zone debt crisis." The euro ended 2010 around 6.5 percent lower against thedollar, its biggest annual drop since 2005, weighed down by thedebt crisis that hit Greece and Ireland. The euro zone currency climbed last week, hitting roughlythree-week highs versus the dollar, as bears gave up theirpositions, frustrated by the currency's firm support at its200-day moving average just below $1.31. Some traders said the euro gained some ground as Europeanequities rose  after earlier euro selling by macrofunds.    "Without an upside surprise in the (U.S.) job data thisweek, dollar/yen is likely to come under renewed pressure,"analysts at BNP Paribas said in a note.
