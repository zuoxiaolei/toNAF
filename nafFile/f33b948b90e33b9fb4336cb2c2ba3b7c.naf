<raw><![CDATA[ MOSCOW, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Standard & Poor'son Monday raised its outlook on Russia's debt ratings to stablefrom negative, citing lower-than-expected budget deficits due tostrong oil prices and cuts in state expenditure. "The stable outlook balances our opinion of the risks toRussia's public finances from sensitivity to oil prices and theneed for additional capital injections into the financialsystem, against the conservative budgetary stance," it said. S&P said it had revised its outlook on Russia from negativewhile affirming its 'BBB/A-3' foreign currency and 'BBB+/A-2'local currency sovereign credit ratings. The agency said it expected that the government's originaltarget of a budget deficit of 8.3 percent of GDP for 2009 wouldturn out to be lower by at least one or two percentage points. "In the absence of a sharp decline in oil prices back below$60 per barrel, we would expect the Russian Federation'sbudgetary position to shift back to surplus by 2012," it said.
