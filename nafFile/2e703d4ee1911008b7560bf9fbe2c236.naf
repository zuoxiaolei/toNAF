<raw><![CDATA[ WASHINGTON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Valuable U.S. trade benefitsfor the Andean region and about 130 other developing countriescould expire, at least temporarily, at the end of year unlessCongress takes action in coming days. The looming expiration creates uncertainty for foreigncompanies who rely on the Andean Trade Preferences Act (ATPA)and the much larger Generalized System of Preferences (GSP)program for duty-free access to the United States. Colombian officials, in particular, are worried that even atemporary expiration would add to the problems the countryfaces after heavy rains and flooding that drove nearly 2million people from their homes. The government of Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos onMonday estimated damages from the country's worst naturaldisaster could reach 10 trillion pesos, which is approximately$5.2 billion. The Colombian flower industry is a major beneficiary ofAPTA, which slashes duties on imports of clothing,   vegetables, plastics, aluminum products and other goods fromthe region to support jobs. An expiration would also hurt U.S. companies and consumersthat benefit from lower-cost imports from the countries. Representative Sander Levin has introduced a bill to extendthe two programs and a third known as Trade AdjustmentAssistance (TAA), which helps retrain workers who have losttheir jobs because of trade competition. Levin, the outgoing Democratic chairman of the House ofRepresentatives' Ways and Means Committee, hopes for a vote inthe House on his package by the end of the week. But Senator Charles Grassley, a senior Republican, opposesthe Levin bill because it does not address his objections to aLabor Department rule that requires TAA to be administered byunionized state employees. Grassley wants the final deadline for states to comply withthe rule to be postponed and the Levin bill does not do that. "So, Senator Grassley doesn't support the Levin bill," aGrassley spokeswoman said. A second congressional aide said "the Levin bill has nochance at all of passing the Senate and would be dead in thewater the minute it arrives." But "the Senate is actively working to find a solution toextend all of the expiring trade programs before the end of theyear," the aide said. Congress is unlikely to let the programs lapse permanently,even if it fails to pass an extension by Dec. 31. However, work could be delayed in 2011 because of the timeit would take to educate new members on the issue. President Barack Obama's administration supports extendingboth ATPA and GSP and has been working with Congress towardthat end, said Nkenge Harmon, a spokeswoman for the U.S. TradeRepresentative's office.(Reporting by Doug Palmer; editing by Todd Eastham)             ]]></raw>
