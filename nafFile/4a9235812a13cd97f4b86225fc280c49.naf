<raw><![CDATA[ FRANKFURT, July 9 (Reuters) - Inflation risks in the eurozone are broadly balanced, the European Central Bank said in itsmonthly bulletin on Thursday. Upside risks to inflation come from higher than expectedcommodity prices and rises in indirect taxes, the central banksaid, and added downside risks come from the outlook foreconomic activity. "Indicators of inflation expectations over the medium tolonger term remain firmly anchored in line with the GoverningCouncil's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2percent over the medium term," the ECB said. The ECB said it expected the current period of extremely lowor negative inflation rates to be short-lived. The editorial in the bulletin was a close repeat of thestatement read by President Jean-Claude Trichet last week, afterthe ECB kept interest rates at 1.0 percent. The euro zone economy is expected to recover gradually andstart posting positive quarterly growth rates by mid-2010, theeditorial said, adding risks to the economic outlook are alsobalanced. Current ECB interest rates at 1 percent remain appropriate,the editorial also said. (Reporting by Sakari Suoninen; editing by Chris Pizzey)             ]]></raw>
