<raw><![CDATA[ * Climate change, biofuels, protectionism spur volatility * Food prices seen rising over next decade * Declining stock to utilisation ratio a "worry"-FAO offical (Adds details from FAO official on lower stocks) By Svetlana Kovalyova and Deepa Babington MILAN/ROME, March 7 (Reuters) - Climate change bringingfloods and drought, growing biofuel demand and national policiesto protect domestic markets could drive up global food pricesand threaten long-term food security, the United Nations said. High and volatile food prices are a growing global concern,partly fuelling the protests that toppled the rulers of Tunisiaand Egypt this year. The aftershocks have been seen across NorthAfrica and the Middle East from Algeria to Yemen. Periods of price volatility are not new to agriculture, butrecent price shocks triggered by extreme weather and increasinguse of grains to produce energy have caused great concern, theU.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organisation said. "There are fears that price volatility may be increasing,"the FAO said in its State of Food and Agriculture report. The growing influence of commodities markets and"counter-productive 'beggar-thy-neighbour' policy responses (tohigh prices)...may exacerbate international market volatilityand jeopardise global food security," it said. The Rome-based FAO has already warned food-producingcountries against introducing export curbs to protect localmarkets as world food prices push further above the levels thattriggered deadly riots in 2007/2008. A declining stock to utilisation ratio for major grainstocks like wheat and maize is a concern, said Kostas Stamoulis,director of Agricultural Development at FAO's economics unit. "We worry about this," Stamoulis told Reuters on thesidelines of the presentation of the report.  "As prices increase, governments and others are trying toreduce their stocks to soften the impact of decreased supplies.This is one of the factors causing high prices ... If there isanother supply shock very soon, like in China for example, thenthe shock will happen amidst low stocks." Global food prices hit a record high in February, and theFAO said last week that further oil price spikes and stockpilingby importers keen to head off unrest would hit already volatilecereal markets. Food prices are projected to rise over the next decade andstay at levels on average above those of the past decade, theagency said on Monday. Urgent coordinated international action was needed to ensuresecurity of food supplies, including improvement of marketregulation and transparency as well as of statistics on foodcommodity markets, establishment of emergency stocks andprovision of safety nets, the FAO said.  NUMBER OF UNDERNOURISHED UNACCEPTABLY HIGH The number of undernourished people in the world has fallen to 925 million people last year from an estimated 2009 peak of1.023 billion, but it remained unacceptably high, the FAO said. In 2010, 16 percent of developing countries' populationswere undernourished, down from 18 percent in 2009 but still wellabove the U.N.'s Millennium Development Goal to halve to 10percent the share of the hungry between 1990 and 2015, it said. The number of hungry people could fall by 100-150 millionpeople if women farmers were given the same access to productionand financial resources as men, the agency said. The yield gap between men and women farmers averages around20-30 percent, mostly due to differences in resource use, thereport said, citing industry studies.  Farm output in developing countries could rise by 2.5-4.0percent if yields on the land farmed by women increased to thelevels achieved by men. That in turn would reduce the globalnumber of undernourished people by 12-17 percent, it said. "We must eliminate all forms of discrimination against womenunder the law, ensure that access to resources is more equal ...and make women's voices heard in decision-making at all levels,"FAO's Director General Jacques Diouf said in the report. "Women must be seen as equal partners in sustainabledevelopment," he said. (Editing by Anthony Barker)             ]]></raw>
