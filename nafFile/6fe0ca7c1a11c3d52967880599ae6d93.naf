<raw><![CDATA[ * Nikkei up 0.7 pct, other Asia shares up 0.5 pct * Shanghai stocks outperform on oil/coal shares * Credit gains, Indonesia CDS tightest in 11 months * Dollar index stuck near 7-wk low, underpins commodities (Repeats item to more subscribers) By Eric Burroughs HONG KONG, July 22 (Reuters) - Asian shares inched up to a10-month peak on Wednesday, but gains were kept in check asinvestors booked profits in the belief that the run up instocks had become overstretched. European stocks were set to open higher, with futures onthe Dow Jones Eurostoxx 50  up 0.4 percent. The dollar was stuck near a seven-week low and governmentbond yields edged higher as portfolio managers kept shiftingfunds away from safe-haven assets, taking heart from the slewof upbeat earnings reports showing companies starting to bounceback from the deep global recession. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke also reassuredinvestors that the central bank was not about to tighten itsultra-loose monetary policy anytime soon in the first of histwo days of Congressional testimony. [ID:nN21221058] But caution is setting in. "We have had a pretty good run-up, and any attempts torally further would be met by profit taking," said Ben Potter,a research analyst at IG Markets Ltd in Sydney. Investors have tended to look past some of the negativesfrom the earnings season, such as declining revenue, to focuson the better-than-expected profits and positive outlooks duein part to aggressive cost-cutting. Apple  was the latest firm to post surprisinglyhealthy profits on strong sales of Mac computers and iPhones,giving its stock a lift in after-hours trade that could helpthe Nasdaq  extend its longest winning streak in 12years. [ID:nN20471555] The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.5 percent and reached its highestlevel since late September. Upward earnings revisions have helped stocks extend theirwinning streak. According to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S,the one-month change in earnings estimates one-year ahead onthe MSCI APXJ is running at 1.53 percent, the highest in threeyears. Asia equity analysts at Credit Suisse said South Korea'sKOSPI was among the regional markets seeing the biggest upwardrevisions to 2009 consensus earnings but said technology sharesmay not have as much value now as the consumer cyclical, energyand material sectors. The KOSPI  lagged with a slight rise of 0.3 percent. Shares of LG Electronics <066570.KS> dropped and limitedthe broader market's advance, with some investors cashing in ontheir 75 percent surge so far this year even after the world'sNo. 3 mobile phone maker blew past expectations forsecond-quarter profit. [ID:nSEO126860] QUICK OR GRADUAL RECOVERY? The Shanghai Composite  performed better than otherAsian indexes with a gain of 2.2 percent, helped by a jump inoil and coal shares such as Sinopec <600028.SS> on hopes forpositive earnings. Companies tied to renewable energy such as Wuhan LinuoSolar Energy <600885.SS> jumped by the 10 percent daily limitafter Beijing announced long-awaited subsidies forutility-scale solar power projects on Tuesday. [ID:nPEK125709] Japan's Nikkei  gained 0.7 percent, with shares ofsemiconductor wafers rising on a report of higher prices. "At this point, I think most people are expecting aneconomic recovery. The issue now is just whether they think itwill happen quickly or gradually," said Tomomi Yamashita, afund manager at Shinkin Asset Management in Tokyo. The boost to risky assets has made investors morecomfortable holding corporate debt, driving spreads onbenchmark credit indexes to their narrowest levels since thecollapse of Lehman Brothers last September. Asia's benchmark iTraxx index of high-grade corporatecredit  was quoted at a mid-point of 148 basispoints by interdealer broker GFI, its tightest level sinceAugust and well off this year's peak near 465 basis points inMarch. Indonesia was a bright spot, with its credit climbing asinvestors have looked past last week's hotel bombings inJakarta and focused on the bright outlook for the economy andstructural reform after the election victory of PresidentSusilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Jakarta's IDX Composite was flat  but near an11-month high struck on Tuesday, while Indonesia's creditdefault swap spreads  were quoted at the lowestlevels in 11 months. In currencies, the dollar index was little changed at 78.90 after extending its slide the previous day to aseven-week low of 78.591. The euro dipped 0.1 percent to$1.4200  but held near a one-month high struck onTuesday. The dollar woes have underpinned a rebound in gold andcommodity prices. Gold edged up 30 cents an ounce to $948.55, just below a five-week high struck last week. U.S.crude oil dipped 40 cents a barrel to $65.21 . In bonds, Treasuries surrendered some of their gains fromthe previous day when Bernanke's caution on the outlook sparkeda strong rally that dragged yields down from a one-month high.Benchmark 10-year notes shed 8/32 in price to yield 3.511percent , up 3 basis points from late U.S. trade.
