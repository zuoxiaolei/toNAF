<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro was steady against the yen in subdued trade on Wednesday, as investors remained particularly cautious ahead of a highly anticipated European summit in Brussels amid growing skepticism over the meeting’s outcome.EUR/JPY hit 99.61 during European afternoon trade, the daily high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 99.39, inching up 0.03%.The pair was likely to find support at 98.52, the low of June 8 and resistance at 100.28, the high of June 14.Hopes that European leaders would make headway on dealing with the debt crisis in the euro area faded after German Chancellor Angel Merkel reiterated her opposition to the idea of joint euro zone bonds on Tuesday.Market participants had hoped the summit would yield some progress towards greater fiscal integration and allowing the bloc's rescue funds to buy government debt.Investors were looking ahead to the outcome of talks between Chancellor Merkel and French President François Hollande later in the day, ahead of the EU summit meeting on Thursday and Friday.Meanwhile, preliminary data showed that consumer price inflation in Germany fell unexpectedly in June, ticking down 0.1% after a 0.2% decline the previous month. Analysts had expected consumer price inflation to be flat in June.Earlier in the day, Italy saw borrowing costs climb to the highest level since December at an auction of six-month government bonds, as investor sentiment towards Italy continued to deteriorate.Italy’s Treasury sold the full targeted amount of EUR9 billion of six-month government bonds at an average yield of 2.95%, up from 2.10% at a similar auction last month.Elsewhere, the yen was lower against the U.S. dollar with USD/JPY adding 0.21%, to hit 79.69.Also Wednesday, official data showed that U.S. core durable goods orders, which exclude transportation items, rose 0.4% in May, below expectations for a 0.9% rise.
