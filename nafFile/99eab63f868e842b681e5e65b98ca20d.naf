<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro slipped to a session low against the pound on Thursday, as hopes for concrete steps to tackle the debt crisis in the euro zone faded ahead of a two-day European Union summit set to begin later in the day.EUR/GBP hit 0.7986 during European morning trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.7995, slipping 0.17%.The pair was likely to find near-term support at 0.7970, the low of May 30 and resistance at 0.8038, Monday’s high.Market sentiment soured after a German government official indicated that the EU summit would not result in any detailed decisions and warned against high expectations among investors ahead of the outcome.Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angel Merkel reiterated her opposition to the idea of joint euro zone bonds, while EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said Wednesday that the summit would focus on short-term measures to stabilize markets and ease pressure on at-risk countries.Adding to the euro negative tone, Italy’s long term borrowing costs rose to their highest level since December following an auction of 10-year bonds, as investor sentiment on the country continued to deteriorate.Meanwhile, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds ticked up to 7%, the level that prompted Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek international bailouts.Elsewhere in the euro zone, official data showed that the number of unemployed people in Germany rose by a seasonally adjusted 7,000 in June, above expectations for an increase of 5,000, but the unemployment rate held steady at 6.8%.In the U.K., official data confirmed that Britain’s economy contracted by 0.3% in the three months to March, but the contraction in the previous quarter was revised up to 0.4%, from a preliminary estimate of 0.3%.A separate report showed that the U.K. current account deficit widened to GBP11.17 billion in the first quarter, from a shortfall of GBP7.22 billion in the fourth quarter. Economists had expected the current account deficit to widen to GBP9.0 billion.The euro was also lower against the U.S. dollar and the yen, with EUR/USD down 0.32% to 1.2429 and EUR/JPY dropping 0.81% to hit 98.58.Later Thursday, the U.S. was to release government data on initial jobless claims, followed by revised data on first quarter economic growth.             ]]></raw>
