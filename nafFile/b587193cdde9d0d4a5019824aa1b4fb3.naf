<raw><![CDATA[ * World stocks up 0.6 pct, set for 3rd monthly rise * U.S. stocks open higher after comments by Fed's Bullard * Brent crude oil near flat (Updates prices, quotes, adds context, copper movement) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Major stock markets rose onMonday as worries eased about the effect of high energy priceson U.S. economic growth, while the dollar hit a 3-1/2-month lowagainst a basket of major currencies. World equities measured by MSCI All-Country World Index added 0.9 percent, after rising 1.1 percent onFriday. The global index is up 2.3 percent this month, on trackfor a third straight monthly rise. Comments by James Bullard, president of the St. LouisFederal Reserve, that the U.S. economy should do well in 2011and that oil prices are not currently a drag on the recoveryhelped boost U.S. stocks. "If oil prices rise further it will restrain economicgrowth, but with no further escalations, at current levels itisn't going to cause a recession," said Jason Pride, directorof investment strategy at Glenmede Investment and WealthManagement in Philadelphia. The dollar, however, came under pressure on expectationsthat Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, in testimony to Congress laterthis week, will stick with his recent economic assessment thatthe recovery is strengthening, but not enough to bring about asignificant improvement in the jobs market. The Dow Jones industrial average  was up 98.95points, or 0.82 percent, at 12,229.40. The Standard & Poor's500 Index  was up 9.03 points, or 0.68 percent, at1,328.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 14.05points, or 0.51 percent, at 2,795.10. U.S. stocks last week had their worst performance sinceNovember on worries about energy prices and the revolt inLibya. Brent crude oil prices were volatile, following a spikelast week on worries over supply disruption from the MiddleEast and North Africa. Brent crude  was last up 0.2percent at $112.41. The uprising in Libya has cut as much as three quarters ofthe country's oil output, prompting Saudi Arabia to step in andplug the supply gap to Libya's oil buyers. Brent crude is up more than 10 percent this month, headingtoward its sixth straight month of rises. It touched a 29-monthhigh of near $120 a barrel last week. The U.S. dollar fell versus a currency basket as investorsspeculated that Fed chief Bernanke will this week signalcontinued support for the central bank's quantitative easingprogram. Bernanke's testifies to Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday,and expectations are that he will reiterate his view of aneconomic recovery that is still not strong enough tosignificantly reduce the jobless rate, suggesting the time isnot ripe for U.S. interest rates to rise. The ICE futures exchange's U.S. dollar index , whichtracks the greenback's performance against a basket of majorcurrencies, was down 0.6 percent. It earlier hit its lowestlevel since Nov. 9. U.S. Treasuries prices remained steady at slightly higherlevels after an index of Midwest business activity came instronger than expected in February. Benchmark 10-year note  yields stood at 3.42percent, unchanged from late last week. U.S. Treasuries earlier were supported by comments by thepresident of the New York Fed, William Dudley, that the U.S.central bank was "very far" from achieving its dual mandate ofmaximum sustainable employment and price stability and shouldbe wary of withdrawing monetary policy support. According to fund tracker EPFR Global, a growing aversionto risky assets in the latest week fueled the biggest flows toglobal bond funds in more three months, and turned moreinvestors away from emerging market stocks. [ID:nN25262438] The rotation out of emerging markets into developedmarkets, partly driven by inflation concerns in emergingeconomies, has led to outperformance in developed markets. TheMSCI emerging market index  has lost 4.2 percent thisyear. Credit Suisse's private bank expected the fund rotation toease in the second quarter. In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  indexof top shares was last up 1.1 percent at 1,172, extending gainsafter Bullard's comments on the U.S. economy. Copper prices also rose, helped by a weaker U.S. dollar andU.S. economic data, including the Midwest business activityreport.
