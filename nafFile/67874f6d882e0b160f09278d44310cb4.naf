<raw><![CDATA[    (For Asia poll , India poll )	    * Inflation to remain at elevated levels in short term	    * C.bank seen raising rates faster than earlier thought	    * Rates to hit 7.50 percent by end 2012	    * Economy to grow at 8.5 percent in FY11/12		 By Anooja Debnath	    BANGALORE, Jan 19 (Reuters) - India's uncomfortably high 	inflation will subside only gradually in the coming quarters asthe economy continues to race ahead, likely prompting thecentral bank to hike interest rates more aggressively thanearlier thought, a Reuters poll showed.	 The wholesale price index (WPI) , India's main 	inflation gauge, is expected to rise by an average 8.8 percentfor the fiscal year ending March 2011 before easing to 6.4percent in the following year.	    This is considerably higher than 8.3 and 5.7 percent 	forecast in the October survey.	 Driven by costlier food items, wholesale price inflation 	soared to an annual 8.43 percent in December, compared with an 	expected 8.35 percent and above the previous reading of 7.48 	percent. 	 Many economists now believe the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) 	will be forced to undertake much swifter policy tightening thanwas previously foreseen.	 "The unexpected rise in December inflation ... turned out to	be a game-changer, and is likely (to) push the central bank to 	front-load another rate hike in January, despite the source of 	pick-up coming largely from volatile food articles," said 	Siddhartha Sanyal, chief economist at Barclays Capital in a 	note.	 Price growth would remain above the RBI's comfort levels, 	according to the latest poll, averaging 7.7 percent in the 	quarter ending March before easing to 5.5 percent in the second 	half of 2012 -- a level the central bank had hoped to reach by 	March this year.	 The poll predicts the central bank will increase rates from 	6.25 percent now to 7.0 percent by end-September this year, a 	quarter earlier than was predicted in a Jan 5 survey, before the	latest inflation numbers were released.	 From there, forecasters expect the RBI to increase rates 	slowly to 7.50 percent by the end of next year.	 The RBI, seen as Asia's most aggressive major central bank 	after it increased rates six consecutive times last year, is set	to raise rates by at least 25 basis points in its Jan 25 policy 	meeting, with some analysts even predicting a substantial 50 	bps hike. 		    GROWTH SLOWDOWN?	    While rampant inflation will be the RBI's primary concern, 	it will also be mindful of a slowdown in growth -- mainly in 	industrial output which slumped to an 18-month low of 2.7 	percent rise in November from the 11.3 percent increase seen a 	month earlier. 	    The Indian economy is still set to grow at the same robust 	pace seen over the last fiscal year, averaging 8.7 percent in 	the year-ending March 2011, before moderating slightly to 8.5 	percent in the following year. 	 These figures are markedly above October's consensus of 8.4 	percent and 8.3 percent, respectively.	 The poll sees growth remaining consistently above 8.0 	percent year-on-year in every quarter until the end of next 	year.	 "It (the Indian economy) will slow down from the current 	year," said A. Prasanna, head of research at ICICI Securities 	Primary Dealership.	    "It's partly because of agriculture -- this year agriculture	is rebounding from a drought, so there is the base effect in 	play, next year that won't be the case."	    "On top of that, industrial and services sectors should also	slow down because (the) RBI has tightened policy and on the 	fiscal side also there is likely to be some tightening."	    Manufacturing and services PMI readings for December, which 	underlined some slack in the economy, further stressed the 	uneasy balance between inflation and growth facing the central 	bank.  	    (For poll data click on )	    (Polling by Bangalore Polling Unit; Editing by Kim Coghill) 	 	             ]]></raw>
