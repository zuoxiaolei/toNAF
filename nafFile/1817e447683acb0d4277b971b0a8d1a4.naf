<raw><![CDATA[Euro pushes higher after agreement on Greece bailout extensionInvesting.com - The euro moved higher against the dollar and the yen on Friday after Greece secured an agreement with the euro zone to extend its bailout by four months.EUR/USD edged up 0.13% to 1.1383 in late trade, recovering from session lows of 1.1278, while EUR/JPY was up 0.18% to 135.47.The euro zone approved the extension of Greece’s €240 billion bailout, removing concerns that the country would face a liquidity crunch when its current bailout agreement expired at the end of the month.Markets have been hit by growing concerns over a possible Greek exit from the euro area if the country missed a debt payment.Athens has until Monday to present a list of reforms to be approved by the country’s creditors in order to secure the four-month bailout extension, which will give it more time to reach a lasting agreement with its creditors.Earlier Friday, data showed that euro zone private sector activity expanded at the fastest pace in seven months in February, but firms continued cutting prices, underlining concerns over persistently low levels of inflation.The Markit composite flash purchasing managers' index, which measures activity in the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to 53.5, the highest since July 2014 from a final reading of 52.6 last month.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was at 94.40 late Friday.Sentiment on the dollar remained subdued after Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s January meeting showed that some officials thought that raising rates too soon could weigh on the U.S. economic recovery, and that a deterioration in the global economic outlook could also pose a threat to the recovery.In the coming week, Tuesday’s testimony by Fed Chair Janet Yellen to the Senate Banking Committee will be closely watched for any indication on when U.S. interest rates may start to rise. Traders will also be watching Monday's deadline on Greece's financial rescue package.Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of this and other significant events likely to affect the markets.Monday, February 23In Germany, the Ifo research group is to publish its report on business climate.Later Monday, the U.S. is to publish a report on existing home sales.Tuesday, February 24The euro zone is to release revised data on consumer price inflation.The U.S. is to produce a private sector report on consumer confidence.
