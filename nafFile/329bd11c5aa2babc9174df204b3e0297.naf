<raw><![CDATA[ MOSCOW, June 4 (Belarus) - Belarus is ready to join aRussia-dominated customs union on July 1 after outstandingdisputes are resolved, Nikolai Snopkov, the country's economyminister said on Friday.  Last week, Russia and Kazakhstan agreed to launch the unionwithout Belarus after negotiations stalled as Russia refused toabolish export duties on the oil it sells Minsk, somethinganalysts view as a key incentive for the former Soviet republicto join the pact. "The meeting between President of Belarus (Alexander)Lukashenko with Russia's Deputy Prime Minister (Igor) Shuvalovconfirmed that both sides plan to settle all disputed issues andjoin the customs union on July 1," Snopkov, in Moscow for talkswith his Russian counterparts, told journalists. Shuvalov visited Minsk earlier this week to mend relationsbetween the formerly close allies. Lukashenko said after Shuvalov's visit that Belarus wasready to compromise to be able to join the union with Russia andKazakhstan on time [ID:nLDE6501B9]. Asked if Belarus is ready to give up its demands for noexport duties on oil and oil products, Snopkov said that "mostlikely, disagreements will be settled." The new trading bloc is expected to boost Moscow's influencein the region but could complicate World Trade Organisationmembership talks.
