<raw><![CDATA[ * Badri says "comfortable" with current oil price * Calls for better discipline from OPEC countries * Badri sees bigger hurdles for deepwater drilling  (Adds quotes, background) By Pete Harrison BRUSSELS, June 27 (Reuters) - OPEC secretary generalAbdullah al-Badri said on Sunday that he was comfortable withoil prices at their current level and he did not expectproduction levels to change between now and October. "Current prices are comfortable at this time," al-Badri toldreporters in his Brussels hotel ahead of a meeting on Mondaywith EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger. The two men are likely to discuss economic growth prospects,which Badri described as fragile in the West. Oil's more than $20 plunge over three weeks last month,sparked by European debt problems, underscored market volatilityfrom equities to commodities and the fragile state of globaleconomic recovery. "Right now we are seeing strong growth in one part of theworld and a sluggish response from advanced countries," Badrisaid. Nevertheless, oil markets are oversupplied, he said, callingon OPEC members to show more discipline in keeping to theirproduction targets, having slipped from 80 percent compliance atone point to around 53 percent today. "When you look at the inventory overhang and floatingstorage, about 244 million barrels, that means there is a lot ofoil in the market -- oversupply," he said. "We need morediscipline." But he saw no need to call another OPEC meeting before theone currently planned for October and no change in productionlevels between now and then. BP's accident in the Gulf of Mexico threatens to add to thelong-term hurdles facing deepwater oil exploration, but al-Badrisaid it should be kept in perspective and the U.S. six month banshould not be extended. A U.S. federal judge on Tuesday struckdown the moratorium imposed by President Barack Obama'sadministration, which has appealed against the decision. "In the long-term maybe we'll see a lot more discipline,more regulation, difficulties to go for deeper drilling -- anddeeper drilling is another frontier we should really go for witha lot of potential," he said. "I see President Obama in limbo," he added. "He's notcertain there is the regulation to prevent another accident, sohe took that decision. I hope after the six months, he'llrevisit his decision and let things go back to normal." (Reporting by Pete Harrison; Editing by Jon Boyle)             ]]></raw>
