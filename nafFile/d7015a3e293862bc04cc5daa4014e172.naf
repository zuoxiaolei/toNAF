<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar index steady after dipping Friday to 2-month low * Next euro upside target is May reaction high at $1.2673 * But euro pauses after boost last week on short-unwinding * U.S. markets holiday likely to mean Monday is subdued By Charlotte Cooper TOKYO, July 5 (Reuters) - The dollar held at its lowest innearly two months on Monday and the euro paused after last week'sboost from unwinding of short and leveraged positions, withtraders and analysts seeing scope for it to squeeze a bit higher. With attention turning to a slowdown in the United States andaway from the euro zone's banking and government debt woes,analysts said the next upside target for the euro was a Mayreaction high at $1.2673. Leveraged trades funded in the euro, be it long dollar,commodity currencies or emerging markets, were being cut, whileat the same time the euro selling seen in April and May looked tobe exhausted for now. "I'm not seeing money flooding back into euro on a broadbasis. You really have to describe it as exhaustion," said GregGibbs, FX strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland in Sydney. The question for markets at this point, with concern that theU.S. recovery was losing steam, was what should they buy. "The fear of maybe not necessarily double-dip but certainly avery long period of low employment growth and very low rates isdefinitely playing into the markets' view," Gibbs said. The euro eased 0.2 percent to $1.2542, with near term supportseen around its 55-day moving, currently at $1.2531. Last week,the euro gained 1.5 percent against the dollar, reversing a lossfrom the previous week and gaining greater distance from June'sfour-year low at $1.1876. Traders also said talk of repatriation by European bankshelped lift the euro. Jonathan Cavenagh, currency strategist at Westpac in Sydney,said leveraged trades funded in euro were being cut and the lowlevel of yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasuries suggested the euroshould be trading higher. U.S. yields have fallen sharply after a slew of soft U.S.economic numbers suggested recovery would be tepid. The 10-yearnote yield has fallen below the psychological 3 percent mark,trading at 2.98 percent. Friday's monthly jobs report showed the economy shed 125,000jobs in June, while private payrolls rose less than expected.Overall employment fell for the first time this year as thousandsof temporary census jobs ended. The data followed a raft of weak reports which suggestedconsumer spending, housing and factory activity were moderating.For more details, click. The dollar lost ground last week before the data and onFriday the dollar index hit its lowest level in nearly two monthsat 84.132. By Monday, it had steadied at 84.499, with short-term supportseen at around 83.20, roughly a 38.2 percent retracement of theindex's move from a low of 74.17 in November to a high of 88.71in June. Trade was quiet, with U.S. markets closed for a holiday. The dollar edged up against the yen, pulling further awayfrom a 7-month low of 86.96 yen set last week, with some talk ofdollar buying by Japanese importers. But it lost 1.8 percent against the yen last week as U.S.yields fell, and traders said there was talk of options triggersbelow 85 yen. The dollar hasn't fallen below 85 yen sinceNovember last year when it hit a 14-year low at 84.82 yen. Data from the Currency Futures Trading Commission showed netlong yen positions jumped in the week to June 29. The value ofthe dollar's net long position slipped to about $9.5 billion inthe week ended June 29, from $12.2 billion in the prior week. The Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar edged upslightly against the greenback. But they still looked vulnerable after losing almost 4percent last week, with sentiment hurt by weekend news thatChina's non-manufacturing PMI had eased below 60 in June,following manufacturing surveys also showing expansion slowing.
