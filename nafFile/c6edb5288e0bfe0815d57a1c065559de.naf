Both the U.S. dollar and yen edged lower in thin trade asgains in global stock markets and upbeat U.S. regionalmanufacturing data eroded the safe-haven demand for the twocurrencies. But yields on U.S. Treasury debt mostly fell in choppytrade as weak U.S. labor market data offset the surprise risein mid-Atlantic factory activity, renewing doubts about howstrong or sustained any U.S. economic rebound might be. Crude prices rose slightly to near a seven-week high asoptimism over the U.S. economy and signs of rising fuel demandoutweighed the increase in new U.S. jobless claims. Global sentiment improved after Chinese stocks jumped 4.5 percent in their second-biggest daily percentagegain this year, easing concerns about an almost 20 percentslide in China's equity markets over the past two weeks. "Investor sentiment appears to be oscillating between riskaversion and relief on a session-by-session basis," saidSreekala Kochugovindan, a strategist at Barclays Capital. "However, the past month has been characterized bydeclining volumes typical of the summer holiday season. Historysuggests that trends established during periods of low tradingvolumes have swiftly petered out once volumes picked up." World stocks as measured by MSCI  were up1.4 percent. U.S. stocks rose for a third straight sessionafter the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their worst day in aboutseven weeks on Monday. Financial stocks contributed the most to gains in U.S.stocks. Citigroup , the most active stock on the New YorkStock Exchange, rose 8.5 percent after an analyst said someinvestors bet the share price will triple in three years. AIG Inc  surged 21 percent to $32.30 after newlyappointed Chief Executive Robert Benmosche told Bloomberg thebailed-out insurer may be able to repay its federal debts andboost value for shareholders. [ID:nN20484709] "Just the fact that the more-important jobless claims wereovershadowed by the manufacturing data and rebound overseasshows how much optimism there is in the market now," said DanFaretta, a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock inChicago. The Dow Jones industrial average  closed up 70.89points, or 0.76 percent, at 9,350.05. The Standard & Poor's 500Index  was up 10.91 points, or 1.09 percent, at 1,007.37.The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 19.98 points, or 1.01percent, at 1,989.22.

October Brent futures  settled down $1.26 abarrel at $73.33. Oil markets have been tracking stocks and the U.S. dollar,as well as broad economic indicators, for signs the recessionmay end, which could foreshadow rebounding fuel demand. Treasuries gains were mostly modest, with shorter maturitynotes unchanged. "The mixed news kind of leaves (Treasuries) paralyzed,"said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed incomeanalysis at Action Economics in San Francisco. The benchmark 10-year note  was trading up 8/32in price to yield 3.42 percent, near its lowest yield levels inmore than a month.
