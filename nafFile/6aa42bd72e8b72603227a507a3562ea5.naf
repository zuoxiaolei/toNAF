<raw><![CDATA[ * Bank stress tests eyed in Europe * Charts suggest possible rise in euro to $1.28 near term (Updates prices, adds details) By Nick Olivari NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a seven-weekhigh against the dollar on Wednesday in technical trading afterthe breach of a key resistance level prompted some investorswho had bet against the single currency to buy to preventlosses. Concerns about the growth outlook for the global economyand plans to test the financial health of European banks hadweighed on the euro for most of the session. European regulators on Wednesday haggled over what detailsto reveal from stress tests of about 100 banks, in a disputethat could undermine confidence in the health checks on theregion's lenders. But the euro/dollar broke through technical resistancearound 1.2610, said Kathy Lien, director of research at GFTForex in New York. "When it broke through that, it broke higher and from thisposition there is no major resistance until 1.2676, the Mayhigh," Lien said. Last week's data on euro/dollar short positions alsoindicated there was only a small decline in euro shortpositions, Lien said, which means there was still a lot ofopportunity for a short squeeze in the euro/dollar. Investors who bet against a currency are often forced toturn around and buy to prevent losses if the currency actuallygains. The euro was last at $1.2636, up 0.1 percent on the day,even after data showed factory orders in Germany, the eurozone's largest economy, fell in May, marking the first declinethis year. The euro rose to $1.2665 on trading platform EBS onWednesday, its highest level in about seven weeks. The highaccording to Reuters data was $1.2664. The euro gained support earlier this week after a solidSpanish syndicated debt sale on Tuesday eased euro zone debtfears and weak U.S. data hit the dollar. Analysts said the single currency could rise further in theshort term as a recent raft of weak U.S. data prompts investorsto unwind long dollar positions and short euro positions builtup since the start of the year. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday the eurohas stabilized and should be on a stronger foundation thanbefore the Greek crisis thanks to debt-reduction measures beingimplemented in the euro zone. Still, most analysts in a Reuters poll believe the eurowill stay weak against the dollar over the coming year. Thesurvey of about 60 analysts, taken July 2-7, predicted the eurowould fall to $1.24 in one month and $1.20 in three months,then to $1.18 in six months and in mid-2011. "The euro remains vulnerable to another downturn asinvestors begin to look to the 16-member bloc's growthprospects amid a backdrop of strict budget cuts and thepotential for another downturn in the global economy," saidOmer Esiner, a chief market analyst at Commonwealth ForeignExchange in Washington, D.C. The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 87.74 yen in late New Yorktrading, close to the session high of 87.77 but still not farfrom a seven-month low of 86.96 yen hit on EBS last week.
