<raw><![CDATA[ * Public finance may worsen dramatically in several years* Fiscal revamp needed to avoid mid-term trouble By Jana Mlcochova and Robert MuellerPRAGUE, July 21 (Reuters) - The Czech Republic must revampits public finances to avoid a dramatic erosion in several yearswhich may lead to a crisis already seen in some other centraland east European countries, central bank Vice-Governor MiroslavSinger said on Tuesday. The Czech Republic has experienced a deep economic downturndue to a collapse of demand in export markets, which has sharplyraised the budget deficit to an expected nearly 5 percent ofgross domestic product this year. The country remains one of the best credits in the region,with credit default swaps at 105 basis points, compared with 321for Hungary. Agency Fitch rates the Czech Republic at A+,Moody's at A1 and Standard and Poors at A. But Singer warned that action was needed now to steer thepublic sector finances, burdened by growing non-discretionaryspending, in the future. "Considering the horizon of public finances, which isseveral years, we really face the threat that they will startdeveloping dramatically worse than now," Singer told Reuters inan interview. "On an ocean ship, there is no point in asking where it willbe the next minute, the position in the next minute wasdetermined long ago. It is worth discussing where it will be inan hour," he said. Several countries in the region, such as Hungary, have beenforced to take out an IMF-led bailout package and deep cuts inspending after falling deep into debt. "If we do not do something about it within some mid-termhorizon, we could in the next crisis get into the position ofthose who have no room today and must accept very dramaticmeasures, which further deepen the crisis," Singer told Reutersin an interview. "Their people are almost getting out on the streets, I wouldnot like to see that day." The Czech government debt stands at 29.8 percent of grossdomestic product but it will jump fast this year and the nextdue to the combination of high deficits, growing costs of debtand falling GDP, and is expected to hit 34 percent in 2009. The central bank has raised its warning over the fiscalpolicy in the past weeks. The country will hold parliamentary elections on Oct 9-10,and the mainstream political parties have so far not come upwith plans to narrow the budget gap.  The leftist Social Democrats have proposed a tax hike fortop earners but that would be more than offset by a hike inbenefits. The interim government in charge until the election has notime to present any fiscal revamp, but it has called for achange in the budget structure. Spending on pensions, welfare and other costs mandated bylaw have grown to about 80 percent of the budget, and will keeprising without a restructuring. Finance Minister Eduard Janota said budget gaps have madediscussion about adoption of the euro currency irrelevant fornow. The country has no euro entry target but the government doesnot see adoption possible until the second half of the nextdecade. (Editing by Stephen Nisbet)             ]]></raw>
