<raw><![CDATA[ * China should buy more American goods to cut tradeimbalance * U.S. trade deficit with China needs to come down (Adds comments, background on the dialogue) By Doug Palmer SHANGHAI, May 19 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of CommerceGary Locke urged China on Wednesday to purchase more Americangoods to help reduce a huge trade imbalance that has causedfriction in U.S.-Sino ties. "Obviously the trade deficit needs to come down," Locketold Reuters in an interview ahead of a high-level U.S.-ChinaDialogue on economic and foreign policy concerns early nextweek in Beijing. "There's two component to it: more exports from the UnitedStates to China and more internal consumption within China sothat they're less reliant on exports," Locke said. The former Washington state governor said he believed theturbulent economic events of the past several years, includingmost recently in Europe, has persuaded Chinese leaders theyneed to find a new model for economic growth. "They recognise that their economy cannot become so exportdependent, especially with the crisis within the EU. That'salso a major destination for Chinese products," he said. The U.S. trade deficit with China totaled $226.8 billion in2009, down more than $40 billion from 2008 but still thelargest the United States has with any country. The huge imbalance has fueled accusations in the U.S.Congress and manufacturing sector that China is manipulatingits currency for an unfair trade advantage by keeping the priceof its yuan artificially low against the dollar. U.S. officials have said those concerns will be on theagenda at the two-day U.S.-China Strategic and EconomicDialogue meeting starting on Monday. Locke is leading a delegation of 24 U.S. companies on aclean energy trade mission to China. A primary purpose is to help meet President Barack Obama'sgoal of doubling overall U.S. exports within five years. Locke stopped short of setting an individual goal ofdoubling U.S. exports to China. But China's push to boost its use of renewable energy andto increase building efficiency offers big opportunities inareas where U.S. companies have a lot to offer, he said. In some cases, it makes more sense for U.S. companies tobuild factories in China, than to ship the goods from theUnited States, Locke said. But U.S. company investment in Chinese manufacturingfacilities also supports U.S. jobs since many of the componentsthat go into final goods produced in China are made in theUnited States, he said. The United States also welcomes Chinese investment in theU.S. manufacturing sector, which helps create jobs in theUnited States, Locke said. "That's been a theme of the United States, with respect toall countries," he said. U.S. companies had more than $45 billion invested in Chinaas of 2008, but Chinese investment in the United States remainsfar below that.
