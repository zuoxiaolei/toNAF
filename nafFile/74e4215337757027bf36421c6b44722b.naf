<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was higher against its Canadian counterpart on Thursday, after official data showed that U.S. jobless claims fell less-than-expected last week, while a separate report showed that Canadian retail sales fell unexpectedly.USD/CAD hit 1.0226 during early U.S. trade, the session high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.0206, gaining 0.24%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.0158, Wednesday’s low and a one-month low and resistance at 1.0242, Tuesday’s high.The U.S. Department of Labor said the number of people filing for initial jobless benefits fell by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 387,000 last week, disappointing expectations for a decline of 9,000 to 380,000.The previous week’s figure was revised up to 389,000 from a previously reported 386,000.In Canada, official data showed that retail sales declined by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in April, confounding expectations for a gain of 0.3%, after rising by 0.4% in March.Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in April, defying expectations for a 0.2% increase.Investor sentiment remained downbeat after weak manufacturing data out of the euro zone and China earlier in the day underlined concerns over the outlook for the global economic recovery.Market participants were also cautious ahead of the outcome of an audit of Spanish banks later in the day, amid concerns that the results could show that a EUR100 billion bailout for the country’s banks agreed earlier this month would not be large enough.The greenback remained supported after the Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that it is extending the current bond buying program until the end of the year, disappointing expectations for more aggressive easing measures, following a recent string of weak U.S. data.The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is also known, was higher against the euro, with EUR/CAD slipping 0.17% to hit 1.2971.Later Thursday, the U.S. was to release industry data on existing home sales, as well as a report on manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia area.              ]]></raw>
