<raw><![CDATA[  * Stocks rally on stimulus hopes * Bank borrowing costs remain under pressure * U.S. bonds edge higher on Fed speculation * Dollar down, oil up slightly (Updates prices, adds details) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - World stocks rose and thedollar fell on Tuesday as dismal U.S. data spurred hopes theFederal Reserve may offer more economic stimulus. Financial markets have been in turmoil over the past monthon concerns the United States may be headed for anotherrecession and as the euro zone's debt crisis has worsened. World stocks, as measured by the MSCI All-Country WorldIndex , and Wall Street's benchmark Standard &Poor's 500 index  are on track for their worst monthsince 2008, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The MSCI All-Country World Index jumped 1.6 percent, whilethe S&P 500 gained 2 percent. Data from China showing factorysentiment helped boost world shares overnight. In the latest disappointing news on the U.S. economy,factory output in the U.S. central Atlantic region contractedagain in August and new home sales fell to a five-month low inJuly. For details, see [ID:nN1E77M0M4] Equity investors are taking a "bad news is good news"approach, though, betting that the data may spur more actionfrom the Federal Reserve. "The data today has raised hopes about the Fed's actions,and after four straight days of losses and flat marketyesterday people are willing to jump at buying opportunities,"said Larry Peruzzi, senior equity trader at Cabrera CapitalMarkets in Boston. There is concern, however, that investors are overlyoptimistic. Speculation is widespread in financial markets thatFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will use his Fridayspeech at a central banker conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming,to signal a new monetary offensive to support a faltering U.S.economy. Bernanke, however, is most likely to outline gradualistmeasures, which would disappoint those looking for a big bangapproach such as a fresh round of bond buying, known as QE3. "The market is really geared up for the idea of additionalasset purchases to at least be put on the table when Bernankespeaks," said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com inBedminster, New Jersey. "I'm not sure it will play out thatway, but that's what the market is betting on now." The Fed chairman looks set to discuss ways the central bankcould tweak the Fed's balance sheet as a means to put furtherpressure on medium and long-term interest rates and anchor themat low levels. These could be implemented in September andOctober at coming Fed meetings. [ID:nN1E77I0NF] Gold prices retreated after earlier hitting record highs asa recovery in appetite for higher-risk assets took the steamout of a rally that many saw as overdone. After rising above$1,900 an ounce, gold  was at $1,862.99. Ongoing fears of European banks' exposure to heavilyindebteded European nations like Greece and Italy is making itmore expensive for banks to fund themselves in short-termfunding markets. U.S. bank debt costs are also being pressured in unsecuredbond markets. The cost for interbank borrowing -- measured bythree-month Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, roseto 0.31178 percentage point on Tuesday. European banks are facing higher dollar funding costs asU.S. money fund investors, nervous about exposures toperipheral euro zone countries, reduce the length and amount ofloans to banks in the region. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  wasup 184.07 points, or 1.70 percent, at 11,038.72. The Standard &Poor's 500 Index  was up 21.24 points, or 1.89 percent,at 1,145.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 50.87points, or 2.17 percent, at 2,396.25. Stimulus measures by the Fed increase the amount of dollarsin the system, driving down the currency's value, which helpsU.S. exports, and prompting investors to seek higher returnselsewhere. The dollar  edged down 0.3 percent against a basketof currencies. Bonds, which normally move inversely to stocks, saw somelight buying after the weak data on speculation the Fed willact to spur the economy, but strong stocks appeared to bekeeping a lid on their rally. In the U.S. Treasury market, the benchmark 10-year note  was up 2/32 in price, its yield edging down to2.106 percent from 2.11 percent late on Monday. Oil prices bounced in choppy trading, supported early bymanufacturing data from China and Europe that was less gloomythan expected. Brent October crude  rose 50 cents to$108.86 a barrel.
