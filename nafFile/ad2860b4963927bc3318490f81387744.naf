<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro falls broadly on widening Greek/German yield spreads * Greek debt issues in focus ahead of EU/IMF aid talks * Canada dollar at 22-mth high vs US dollar on rate outlook (Releads, updates throughout) By Naomi Tajitsu and Neal Armstrong LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly onWednesday, relinquishing earlier gains, as a rise in the premiumdemanded to buy Greek bonds highlighted uncertainty about howAthens would resolve its debt problems. The euro hit a two-week low against the dollar, stung by awidening in the Greek/German government bond yield spread beyond500 basis points as talks began in Greece with the EuropeanUnion and International Monetary Fund on a bailout package.[ID:nLDE63J18U] The cost of insuring against a Greek default climbed to arecord high. Greece is widely expected to request up to 30billion in emergency aid from the euro zone and IMF. Germany's economy minister said IMF aid could amount to 12billion euros, in line with estimates, but added aid should waituntil the effects of Greece's austerity measures were seen,underlining the uncertainty that hangs over the issue.[ID:nBAT005318] "The FX market is nervous about widening sovereign spreads.The German minister's comments on Greece look to be driving it,"said Paul Robson, currency strategist at RBS. By 1136 GMT, the euro  had fallen more than half apercent on the day to $1.3360 according to Reuters data, itslowest since April 9. Losses in the euro helped to boost the dollar as worriesabout Greece increased the appeal of the U.S. currency, seen asa safe haven. Against a currency basket , it recoveredfrom the day's low to trade 0.3 percent higher at 81.289. But the dollar  fell 0.3 percent to the day's low of92.94 yen, as the low-yielding Japanese currency benefited froma sudden shift to risk aversion. The yen recovered from broad losses as the Greek debt crisistook centre stage. Earlier in the day, it came under sellingpressure as strong U.S. earnings boosted risk appetite, althoughthis dissipated during the European session. The market awaited a raft of first-quarter earnings reportsfrom AT&T, McDonald's, Starbucks and other U.S. corporates. Apple Inc  posted first quarter earnings on Tuesdaythat far exceeded expectations, while Goldman Sachs  alsoannounced strong results.  CANADA DOLLAR SHINES The Canadian dollar  rallied across the board,pushing as high as C$0.9931 to the U.S. dollar in earlierEuropean trade, its strongest since May 2008. It rose toC$1.3330 to the euro, its highest since November 2007. The Canadian currency extended its rally from Tuesday, whenthe Bank of Canada signalled an interest rate rise may come asearly as June. Stronger commodity prices also provided a boost. "The Canadian dollar is rallying after the BoC dropped itsconditional commitment not to move on rates," said Adam Cole,global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.  "We have a near-term target versus the U.S. dollar ofC$0.9800 and expect that to be reached pretty quickly," he said. It was also on the cusp of an 18-month high against the yen, having risen about 11 percent against the Japanesecurrency since starting its rally in late February. The Swedish crown  hit a 19-month high againstthe euro of 9.5850 per euro, extending its rally after Sweden'scentral bank on Tuesday cemented market expectations for a risein interest rates in July or September.
