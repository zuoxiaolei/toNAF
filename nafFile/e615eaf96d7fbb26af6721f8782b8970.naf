In recent weeks, China has movedto cool bank lending to curb inflation and forestall assetbubbles. [MKTS/GLOB] "The risk-aversion trade seems to be back in vogue. Marketsare focusing on things that have arisen over the past couple ofweeks, which include China continuing to cool down theirskyrocketing economy," said John Curran, senior vice-presidentat CanadianForex. "People are looking to them to lead the recovery. If theystart to cut back, everyone else is going to have to cut back.If we cut back while we're just starting to get out it's goingto dampen hopes and dampen the recovery." Standard & Poor's added to the sour mood by warning itwould cut Japan's credit rating unless it produced a credibleplan to rein in its soaring debt.

Markets were also looking for guidance from U.S. PresidentBarack Obama's State of the Union address on Wednesday.
