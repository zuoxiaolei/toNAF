<raw><![CDATA[ * Discussion is part of effort to broaden EFSF's capability * Proposal among others being weighed as part of new package  By Jan Strupczewski BRUSSELS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The euro zone is consideringallowing the European Financial Stability Facility to buy backthe bonds of member states in trouble as part of a broaderresponse to the sovereign debt crisis, a euro zone source said. The EFSF is a special purpose vehicle that can borrow moneyagainst government guarantees and lend it to a euro zone countrycut off from market financing, in exchange for a tough programmeof fiscal consolidation and structural reform. The 17 countries that share the euro are in discussionsabout raising the EFSF's effective lending capacity, from around250 billion euros closer to its 440 billion euro ceiling, whilealso broadening how the funds can be used. The changes are part of a package of new measures that theeuro zone is expected to announce by mid-March as it tries todraw a line under the sovereign debt crisis, which has forcedGreece and Ireland to seek EU and IMF financial help. Under the proposal being discussed, the EFSF would be ableto buy the bonds of a distressed country in the secondarymarket, which could help stabilise that country's bond market. "This option has always been on the table as a part of the'comprehensive package'," a euro zone source with knowledge ofthe discussions told Reuters on Thursday. "It was discussed only in general under the heading of'broadening the scope of EFSF activities', not in relation toany specific country," the source said.  The source said the potential buy-backs would not be astand-alone measure, but part of a broader programme ofconsolidation and reform agreed with the troubled country. "The buy-backs could be provided in combination with a loanor recapitalisation of banks in the recipient country, forexample," the source said. While no decisions have been taken so far and more technicaltalks are likely over the coming weeks on various options, therewas some support for the idea among euro zone officials. "It was one of the options more seriously considered. Somepeople were quite pushing this. I think technically it would bethe EFSF buying back the bonds and then somehow swapping themagainst new issuance," the source said. The source said the idea was discussed separately from aproposal to allow the EFSF to buy bonds of countriesexperiencing market stress on the secondary market, as theEuropean Central Bank is currently doing. "I think the bond buying programme is something else, atleast purchases on the secondary market and buybacks werediscussed as a separate point," the source said. The source said the Commission had argued that under presentfinancing conditions countries under market stress would notbenefit that much from such an ECB-style bond buy-backprogramme. But the source also said opposition to this idea could berooted in concern about the potential losses it could mean foreuro zone banks which have invested heavily in, for example,Greek or Irish paper and would lose money selling those assetsmore cheaply via buy-backs at current market rates. "I think it is politically easier to say we are saving theeuro than to give a lot of money to banks at the time whenbudgets are being tightened," the source said. "Although the amounts needed to recapitalise them wouldprobably be much smaller than the money needed to bail outeveryone against whom these banks have an exposure," the sourcesaid.
