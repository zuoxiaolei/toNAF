<raw><![CDATA[ * Markets slide on jobs data, pull back some on ISM * S&P 500, oil down but off early lows * Euro at 1-month high as Greece aid looks likely by July (Updates market activity, prices) By Barani Krishnan NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks slid onFriday and the dollar tumbled after U.S. jobs growth for Maycame in way below market expectations, heightening worries thatthe world's largest economy is in a protracted slowdown. Other stock markets were flat to down slightly. However, a report showing encouraging expansion in the U.S.services sector, one of the few bright spots in a weekinundated with gloomy data, helped trim losses in equity andcommodity markets. The euro hit a one-month high against the dollar on newsthat international aid would be available for Greece as earlyas next month. Stock and oil prices traded off their lows after theInstitute for Supply Management noted a modest recovery in theU.S. services sector in May from April's slump.[ID:nN03252131] The U.S. Labor Department's monthly report showed theeconomy adding the smallest number of jobs since September. "The market sold off hard this morning, but it's coming  back a bit," said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist atChicago-based Northern Trust Global Investments, which hasabout $650 billion in assets under management. "I don't thinkthat's a surprise." "Certainly the jobs number wasn't good. The ISM servicenumber was pretty good," added Phil Orlando, chief equitymarket strategist at Federated Investors in New York. Graphic on key economic and cyclical indicators http://r.reuters.com/pad89r^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The Labor Department said the U.S. jobless rate rose to 9.1percent in May as high energy prices and the effects of Japan'searthquake bogged down the economy. Closely watched nonfarm payrolls increased 54,000 lastmonth. Private employment rose 83,000, the smallest amountsince June, while government payrolls dropped 29,000. Economists polled by Reuters had expected payrolls to rise150,000 and private hiring to increase 175,000 in May. Thegovernment revised employment figures for March and April toshow 39,000 fewer jobs created than previously estimated. Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500  was down about 0.4percent by 1:45 p.m. EDT (1745 GMT), after hitting lows frommid-April earlier. For the week, it was poised to close about2.5 percent lower, marking a fifth straight week of declines. While some fund managers brooded over the depressing jobsreport, others were looking ahead. "People have come to the conclusion that the economy is ina slow patch right now, and people are trying to figure out howtemporary this slower growth is -- whether it's actually achange or a bump in the road for the recovery, and right nowit's a bump in the road," said Giri Cherukuri, head trader atOakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. Some wondered whether the Federal Reserve will send morecheap money their way to extend support given to markets sincethe financial crisis. "It doesn't matter what the reality is, it matters what theperception is, and the perception is that QE3 will at least bedebated again instead of being tossed on the fire," said DennisGartman, author of a markets commentary letter. The Fed's $600 billion bond-buying program, known in themarket as QE2, is scheduled to end this month. The program hadflooded financial markets with dollars since October, drivingmost of the gains in stocks and commodities. The Dow Jones industrial average  was down 50.18points, or 0.41 percent, at 12,198.37. The Standard & Poor's500 Index  was down 5.88 points, or 0.45 percent, at1,307.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down 21.87points, or 0.79 percent, at 2,751.44. Global stocks, measured by MSCI's world equity index, steadied from early declines. European shares  settled down 0.4 percent. U.S. crude oil  was down 0.2 percent, returning abovethe $100 per barrel level. It fell 2 percent earlier on worriesthat any further erosion of the U.S. labor market would hitconsumer spending, reducing fuel demand. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up8/32, its yield at 3.0023 percent. Ten-year Treasury yields fell below 3 percent this week forthe first time since December as investors became wary aboutthe near-term economic outlook.
