<raw><![CDATA[ * Turkey to continue power projects with Iran -minister * Iran gas pipeline to feed European demand  (Adds Tupras comments, background paras 6-8) By Orhan Coskun ANKARA, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Turkey will support petrol salesby Turkish companies to Iran, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz toldReuters on Wednesday, despite U.S. sanctions that aim to squeezethe Islamic Republic's fuel imports. The pledge came ahead of an expected resumption of talksnext month between world powers and Tehran on the Iraniannuclear programme, which Washington suspects aims to developatomic weapons. "If the preference of the private sector is to sell these(petroleum) products to Iran, we will help them. There is nodemand for Turkey to halt the trade of these products withIran," Yildiz said in an interview. The sale of petrol, as well as other projects Turkey isplanning with Iran, may indicate a shift in its energy policy togive priority to its energy-rich neighbours in the Middle Eastover conditions set by its traditional Western allies. Any firms that sell gasoline to Iran could face retributionincluding a possible ban from accessing the U.S. financialsystem or denial of U.S. contracts, according to a document fromthe U.S. Treasury. Tupras, Turkey's sole refiner and gasoline exporter which isowned by Koc Holding, declined to say whether the company hadsold anything to Iran. The refinerbuys 33 percent of its crude from the Islamic Republic, however. A Tupras official said, "For us, Iran is more important thanAmerica, because we get crude oil from them. We don't getanything from America."  GASOLINE SALES Although Iran is the world's fifth-largest crude exporter,it has to import around 40 percent of its gasoline needs becauseit does not have enough domestic refining capacity. Yildiz said plans by Turkey and Iran for joint constructionof power plants with a total capacity of 6,000 megawatts wouldcontinue, giving the two countries enough capacity to feed theirown markets as well as other countries in the Middle East. A planned natural gas pipeline from the Islamic Republic toTurkey by private Turkish company SOM Petrol will be used tosupply European gas markets as well Turkey's demands, theminister said. Turkey, which is a NATO member and European Union membercandidate, has seen its capital rise sharply in the MuslimMiddle East since Ankara's vocal condemnation of the killings ofnine pro-Palestinian activists aboard a Gaza-bound aide ship. Ankara has recently drawn closer to Tehran. Together withBrazil, it brokered a nuclear fuel swap in May in the hopes thatthe deal would draw Iran and major powers back to thenegotiating table. Iran, which says its nuclear programme is for peacefulpurposes, gave an assurance that it would stop enriching uraniumto 20 percent purity if world powers agreed to the proposedswap, but their response was lukewarm. Since June, the U.N. Security Council, the United States,and the European Union have imposed additional sanctions thathave increased the pressure on Tehran. Turkey's gasoline sales to Iran dropped 73 percent in Julyto $25.55 million as the sanctions came into force. Sales werethe equivalent of one cargo, according to Reuters calculations.. Russian oil giant LUKOIL has also resumed gasoline salesinto Iran in partnership with China's state-run firm ZhuhaiZhenrong..
