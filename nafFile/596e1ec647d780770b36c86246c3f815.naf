<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar inches up vs euro after CIC comments * Yen recovers after CIC says it will weaken * Dollar seen in consolidation mode, bias to downside (Adds comment, adds detail, updates prices)  By Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The dollar edged up on Tuesday,clinging to gains made after an official from a Chinesesovereign wealth fund said he did not think the U.S. currencywould depreciate further. Comments from China International Corp official Peng Junmingthat the dollar had hit bottom and had limited room to fallfurther, while the yen would keep falling, had pushed the dollarto the day's highs versus the euro and the yen. But the greenback trimmed its gains on lingering concernslast week's U.S. payrolls indicated the economy remained in thedoldrums, and that interest rates would not rise until later inthe year. "We're still in a phase of dollar consolidation, but it ispossible that the dollar can weaken in the coming weeks," saidMarcus Hettinger, global currency strategist at Credit Suisse inZurich. "Given the weak payrolls figures, U.S. rate expectationshave fallen, which is weighing on the currency." The dollar has started 2010 in negative territory againstmajor currencies due to growing expectations that the Fed willkeep rates essentially at zero at least through the first halfof the year as the economy crawls out of recession. Low rates tarnish the dollar's appeal from a yieldperspective. Interest rate futures indicate a significant chance of arate rise is not priced in until the third quarter of the year. By 1040 GMT, the dollar index was flat on the day at 77.030.In Asian trade, it had climbed as high as 77.312. The comments from China's $300 billion sovereign wealth fundpushed the dollar to the day's high against the yen at 92.43yen, before pulling back to around 91.70 yen, down 0.4 percenton the day. The yen gained broadly, pushing the euro down 0.5 percent to133.03 yen on speculation that Japanese investors holding eurozone bonds may dump the single currency when some of those bondsare redeemed later in the day. The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.4505, but hovered withinreach of $1.4557 hit on Monday, its strongest sincemid-December. "Due to further potential for disappointment regarding theFed rate expectations we see further upward potential inEUR/USD," Commerzbank analysts said in a note. Still, they added the single European currency may encounterpsychological resistance around $1.4570. Charts show that level to be around the 38.2 percentFibonacci retracement of the euro's fall from a high around$1.5140 hit in November to a 3-1/2-month low around $1.4215 hitlast month. Against the Swiss franc, the euro traded at 1.4758 francs,not far from a 10-month low around 1.4725 hit on Monday. The Swiss currency pulled back from that peak after SwissNational Bank Chairman Philipp Hildebrand reminded the marketthe central bank may intervene to limit strength in the domesticcurrency against the euro. The Australian dollar traded half a percent lower at$0.9260, stung by the CIC comments and weak Australian housingfigures. Earlier in the day it had fallen as low as $0.9235,retreating from a near two-month high of $0.9326 hit on Monday. (Editing by Nigel Stephenson)             ]]></raw>
