<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar remained broadly higher against its major counterparts on Thursday, as market sentiment remained under pressure following a flurry of downbeat economic reports from the U.S., the euro zone and China.During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was sharply higher against the euro, with EUR/USD dropping 0.72% to 1.2956.The euro remained under pressure after preliminary data showed that the euro zone’s manufacturing purchasing manufacturers' index rose more-than-expected in September to 46.0, from 45.1 the previous month, while the service sector PMI fell unexpectedly to 46.0, from 47.2.A separate report showed that manufacturing activity in Germany contracted at the slowest rate in six months in September, while service sector activity grew modestly.In France, manufacturing activity tumbled unexpectedly in September, dropping to a three-and-a-half year low led by a marked reduction in incoming new business. Also Thursday, Spain’s Treasury sold EUR859 billion worth of 10-year government bonds at an average yield of 5.66%, down from 6.64% at a similar auction last month.The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD falling 0.10% to 1.6206.The pound found some support after official data showed that U.K. retail sales fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in August, compared to expectations for a 0.4% decline. Retail sales rose by 0.3% in July.Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen, with USD/JPY edging down 0.20% to hit 78.22, but sharply higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF climbing 0.53% to trade at 0.9333.In Japan, official data showed that the trade deficit widened unexpectedly to JPY0.47 trillion in August, from a deficit of JPY0.37 trillion the previous month. Analysts had expected the trade balance to remain unchanged in August.In addition, the greenback was broadly higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD rising 0.39% to 0.9783, AUD/USD dropping 0.69% to 1.0407 and NZD/USD slipping 0.15% to hit 0.8256.The commodity-linked currencies came under broad selling pressure after data showed that China’s HSBC Flash Purchasing Managers Index remained in contraction territory for the 11th consecutive month, adding to fears over a further slowdown in the region’s largest economy.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, climbed 0.50%, to trade at 79.57.In the U.S., official data showed that manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia-region improved more-than-expected in September, but remained in contraction territory for the fifth consecutive month.The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that its manufacturing index improved to minus 1.9 in September from August’s reading of minus 7.1. The data came after the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending September 15 fell to a seasonally adjusted 382,000, compared to expectations for a decrease to 375,000.             ]]></raw>
