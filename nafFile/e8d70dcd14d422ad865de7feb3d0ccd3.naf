<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The Australian dollar edged lower against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, but sentiment remained mildly supported amid sustained hopes that the European Central Bank will take further action to contain the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone.AUD/USD hit 1.0532 during late Asian trade, the pair’s lowest since August 3; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.0538, falling 0.15%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.0448, the low of July 30 and resistance at 1.0636, the high of March 19.Sentiment remained supported by expectations that the ECB will soon take steps to help lower Spanish and Italian borrowing costs, after bank head Mario Draghi indicated last week that the bank may restart its bond buying program.The ECB said action would be conditional on euro zone governments experiencing difficulty on bond markets activating the bloc’s bailout funds to purchase government bonds and accepting strict conditions and supervision.Investors remained cautious however, after ratings agency Standard & Poor’s revised Greece’s credit rating outlook from stable to negative on Tuesday, saying that a worsening economy raises the likelihood the troubled nation will need more support from European Union lenders.In Australia, official data showed that home loans rose less-than-expected in June, ticking up 1.3% after a 0.9% decline the previous month. Analysts had expected home loans to rise 2.1% in June.Elsewhere, the Aussie was fractionally higher against the euro with EUR/AUD edging down 0.08%, to hit 1.1739.Later in the day, the U.S. was to release preliminary data on nonfarm productivity, followed by a government report on crude oil inventories.              ]]></raw>
