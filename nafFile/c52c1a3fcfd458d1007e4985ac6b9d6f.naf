<raw><![CDATA[ * U.S. jobs data awaited * Stocks eke out gains * Dollar steady to slightly weaker * Aussie mining tax deal supports shares  By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - World shares eked out gains foronly the second time in nine sessions on Friday but the rise waslikely to be contingent on key U.S. jobs data due later. The dollar was slightly lower against a basket of majorcurrencies and euro zone sovereign debt firmed a bit. The U.S. non-farm payrolls report, due at 1230 GMT, isalways a market mover, but this month's will be particularlyscrutinised as it comes amid signs of a slowdown in U.S. andglobal economic recovery. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting a fall in Junenon-farm payrolls of 110,000 -- the first drop this year. But itwill be primarily because of the disappearance of temporaryfederal census-taking jobs. Private-sector hiring is forecast to rise to 112,000 , upfrom 41,000 in May. Riskier assets such as equities have been hit over recentweeks by weak data suggesting that the global economy is pullingback. Some bearish analysts even expect a double-dip recession. "The U.S. economy doesn't look so good. Wall Street ischoppy and it's hard to predict trends, but it's starting tolook a bit like a bear market," said Koichi Ogawa, chiefportfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments in Japan. MSCI's all-country world stock index  was up0.2 percent, about 8 percent lower than it was when a shortrally began petering out on June 21. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  was up 0.2percent with miners higher after Australia dumped its proposed"super profits" tax on the sector for a lower resource rent tax.[ID:nSGE6600LW] Shares in Anglo American , Antofagasta , BHPBilliton , Rio Tinto  and Xstrata  rose 1.3to 2.9 percent.  Earlier, Japan's Nikkei  closed up 0.1 percent. Ithas shed 5.5 percent on the week.  DOLLAR STEADY The dollar steadied after steep losses on Thursday broughton by economic concerns, fanned by data showing weekly claimsfor U.S. jobless benefits rose unexpectedly while growth in themanufacturing sector slowed in June. The dollar index , a gauge of its performance againstsix other major currencies, hovered above a two-month low afterit shed 1.6 percent on Thursday. The index was slightly lower on the day at 84.59. The euro was holding steady around $1.2518  aftersurging more than 2 percent on Thursday to $1.2541 in itsbiggest one-day advance since mid-March last year. Euro zone government bond yields were flat to lower ahead ofthe jobs data. "The market feels a bit long, there may be someconsolidation into payrolls but the risk is we'll see a biggermove if the number is well above consensus rather than if it iswell below," a trader said.
