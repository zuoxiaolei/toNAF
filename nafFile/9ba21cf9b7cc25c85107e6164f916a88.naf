<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – Last week saw the U.S. dollar weaken against the Swiss franc, falling to an almost one-month low as risk appetite recovered on the back of hopes for a plan to stem the financial crisis in the euro zone, dampening demand for the safe haven greenback.USD/CHF hit 0.9272 on Monday, the weeks high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.8912 by close of trade on Friday, tumbling 3.85% over the week.The pair is likely to find support at 0.8685, the low of September 16 and resistance at 0.9110, last Wednesday’s high.On Friday, France and Germany appeared to move closer to an agreement on a plan to recapitalize European lenders, bolster the firepower of the euro zone’s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility and restructure Greek sovereign debt.At the conclusion of the G-20 summit on Saturday, world financial leaders urged the European leaders to deal “decisively” with the crisis. European leaders hope to complete the rescue plan at a summit on October 23, in time to present to a meeting of G-20 leaders early next month.Risk appetite was also boosted after data on Friday showed that U.S. retail sales rebounded in September, increasing at the fastest rate in seven months. The Commerce Department said sales rose 1.1% last month, after a revised 0.3% increase in August, outstripping expectations for a 0.5% gain.Earlier in the week, the franc also strengthened against the euro, as investors trimmed expectations that the Swiss National Bank will adjust its minimum exchange rate target against the euro.Early last month, the SNB imposed a franc ceiling of 1.20 per euro and resumed purchases of foreign currencies in order to reduce the risk of recession and deflation in the Swiss economy. In the week ahead, any signs that European Union leaders are making progress on steps to contain the debt crisis in the euro zone look likely to continue to support risk appetite.
