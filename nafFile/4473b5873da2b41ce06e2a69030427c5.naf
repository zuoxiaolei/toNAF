<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The euro tumbled to a 3-week low against the yen on Thursday, as lingering fears over the fiscal health of peripheral euro zone nations kept the single currency on the defensive.EUR/JPY hit 108.46 during European afternoon trade, the pair’s lowest since December 1; the pair subsequently consolidated at 108.58, tumbling 0.81%.The pair was likely to find short-term support at 108.33, the low of November 30, and resistance at 110.10, Wednesday’s high. Lingering fears over the fiscal health of peripheral euro zone nations continued to weigh on the single currency after ratings agency Fitch downgraded Hungary’s debt earlier in the day and signaled it may cut the rating to junk. The ratings agency said that a lack of a coherent medium-term fiscal strategy undermined confidence in the country’s sustainability of public finances.The downgrade follows Tuesday’s warning that the ratings agency may cut Greece’s credit ranking to non-investment grade within six weeks, while Moody’s Investor Service said it may downgrade Portugal's A1 rating by one or two notches after a review that will take no more than three months.Meanwhile, the euro was also down against the U.S. dollar, with EUR/USD slumping 0.29% to hit 1.3061.Earlier in the day, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said that China was willing to assist countries in the euro zone return to economic health and would support the International Monetary Fund bailout package for the single currency bloc.             ]]></raw>
