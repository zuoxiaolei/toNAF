<raw><![CDATA[ * New govt planning overseas drive to restore credibility * Moody's downgrades Irish banks after sovereign cut * Irish govt considering 2 bln euros of asset sales  DUBLIN/LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Ireland kickstarted adiplomatic offensive to restore its credibility on internationalmarkets on Monday with a pledge to avoid any action that wouldfurther rattle euro zone debt markets. Talk of a Greek restructuring, denied by the country'sfinance minister, has put investors on edge and Prime MinisterEnda Kenny balked at a suggestion that Dublin could use thethreat of default to extract concessions from European partners. "We have no intention of causing mayhem here," Kenny toldBBC radio. The former primary schoolteacher, propelled to power inFebruary, is in London for talks with British Prime MinisterDavid Cameron as part of a drive to highlight recent progress intackling Ireland's financIal crisis. Investors have given a cautious thumbs-up to governmentefforts to deal with the country's banks, at the root of thecrisis, with tough stress tests, a radical restructuring and apledge to recapitalise them by a further 24 billion euros. But concerns a Greek restructuring could trigger contagioncoupled with Ireland's spluttering growth prospects have undonemuch of the positive sentiment. The premium investors demand to hold 10-year Irish paperover benchmark German Bunds is currently around 653 euros, some58 basis points wider than a near two-month low of 595 bps hitearlier this month. Moody's rating agency downgraded Ireland'sgovernment-guaranteed banks by two notches on Monday following asovereign downgrade last week, meaning that all the lenders arenow classified as junk.  ASSET SALES Investors are concerned Ireland's economy will not be ableto grow fast enough to sustain its debt burden since theInternational Monetary Fund and European Union arranged an 85billion euro ($123 billion) bailout last year. Greece, whose debt burden is expected to approach 160percent of annual output by 2013, has laid out plans to sellstakes in key state firms to quell debt worries. Kenny said his government was considering which of Ireland'sstate assets will be sold to raise around 2 billion euros. Areport by University College Dublin economics professor ColmMcCarthy outlined five billion euros worth of proposed sales. "The government will consider Colm McCarthy's report and wewill make decisions in respect of what's feasible and what's notfeasible," he told Irish state broadcaster RTE. Ireland's new coalition administration has vowed to restorethe country's international reputation after the humiliation ofan EU-IMF bailout and a slew of financial scandals. Deputy Prime Minister Eamon Gilmore is meeting EuropeanUnion ambassadors in Dublin on Monday to update them on thegovernment's economic plans. Ireland's own ambassadors are being recalled in the next fewmonths for briefings on how to promote the country overseas. Kenny will make a speech to British investors in the City ofLondon later on Monday and said the trip would be followed upwith a visit to New York in a couple of weeks. "I will be spelling out the message that we are not the sameas we were. We are in a very different place now."
