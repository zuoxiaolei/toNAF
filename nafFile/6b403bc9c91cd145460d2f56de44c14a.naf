<raw><![CDATA[ * U.S. earnings outperform, stoke risk appetite * German ZEW sentiment index surges * Euro pressured vs dlr on concerns about Greece * Hawkish RBA, BoC boosts Aussie, Canadian dollars  (Recasts, adds quote, updates prices, changes byline,dateline; previous LONDON) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar and yenslipped on Tuesday as global risk appetite improved afterrobust first-quarter U.S. earnings led by Goldman Sachs andexpectations of rate increases in Australia and Canada. The euro rose to session highs against the dollar after theGerman ZEW institute's April economic sentiment index came instrongly above forecast. The single euro zone currency,however, fell later in the session amid persistent worriesabout debt-stricken Greece. Adding to bullish sentiment, Goldman Sachs hit by  fraudcharges by the Securities and Exchange Commission four daysago, beat market expectations on Tuesday, reportingfirst-quarter earnings per common share of $5.59. "Earnings in the U.S. continue to outperform for the firstquarter.. and the beats overall this earnings season have comeboth from the top and bottom lines," said Jacob Oubina, seniorcurrency strategist, at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. "The reports are suggestive of a steady return to somesemblance of organic growth in the U.S. and the the globaleconomies," he said, adding that as a result the dollar and yenhave weakened. In early New York trading, the ICE Futures' dollar index, agauge of the greenback's value against six major currencies,was down 0.2 percent at 80.885 The yen came off Monday's one-month highs hit against thedollar as investor appetite for riskier assets gained supportfrom positive U.S. earnings, which helped Wall Street stocksrise and eased fears about the impact of the U.S. SEC's fraudcase brought against Goldman. However, the dollar rose 0.6 percent against the yen at92.99 yen. The euro also gained versus the yen to 125.41 up 0.6percent, but was flat versus the dollar at at  $1.3484. The yen also fell on the crosses, with Aussie/yen rallying1.3 percent to 86.74 and sterling/yen rising 0.9 percent to143.01. The Australian dollar was boosted across the board by ahawkish tone to the minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia'sApril meeting. The RBA said a coming boom in export earningsmeant it could not delay a hike in interest rates. The Australian central bank's statements led some investorsand analysts to bet it may raise rates yet again by another 25basis points as early as May. The Australian dollar rose 0.9 percent against thegreenback to US$0.9321. "We saw a strong performance from the Australian dollarafter a hawkish RBA and that furthered risk-taking in themarket," said Amelia Bourdeau, senior currency strategist atUBS in Stamford, Connecticut. But traders remained wary overall given that the Greecesituation is far from resolved. The euro earlier fell after European Central Bank GoverningCouncil member Axel Weber said Greece may require assistance ofup to 80 billion euros to avoid default, according to a reportin the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. That amount would be far larger than the 30 billion euroaid mechanism agreed by euro zone finance ministers earlierthis month. The Canadian dollar, meanwhile, rose, pushing the U.S.dollar down 1.4 percent at C$1.0002 after the Bank of Canadasignaled it will raise interest rates soon, possibly as earlyas June.
