<raw><![CDATA[ * U.S. dollar index hits lowest since early June * Dollar rises to three-week high vs yen * U.S. new-home sales rise sharply in June (Adds quotes, updates prices) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dropped to amore than seven-week low against the euro on Monday as a jumpin U.S. new-home sales bolstered the market's appetite forriskier assets and dimmed the greenback's safe-haven appeal. The yen also fell broadly, pushing the dollar to itshighest level versus the Japanese currency in three weeks andlifting the euro to its strongest level in nearly a month. Boththe dollar and yen tend to fall when risk appetite improves. "Risk appetite is currently the driver in the market.Statistics such as the housing data are less bad," said JoeTrevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in Ridgewood,New Jersey. "So we're seeing a weaker dollar. Euro/yen is alsoup and that's pushing euro/dollar higher as well." In late afternoon New York trading, the euro rose to$1.4299, its highest since June 3, according to Reuters data.It was last at $1.4237, up 0.2 percent from late Friday. The euro was also buoyed by data showing German consumersentiment at its highest level in over a year. Analysts at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ expect, however,that the euro's gains against the dollar will prove limited,with the euro likely to hit a top in the $1.4500-$1.5000 rangebefore year-end. The dollar will then likely graduallyappreciate heading into 2010. "The combination of Federal Reserve tightening initiallythrough the reining-in of excess liquidity, more apparentrelative U.S. outperformance over the euro zone...and thesignificant improvement in the U.S. external position shouldprove a more supportive environment for the dollar," wrote LeeHardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo in London. Gains in the euro pushed the ICE Futures' U.S. dollarindex, a measure of its value against six major currencies, toits lowest since early June at 78.396. The dollar index lasttraded at 78.655, down 0.1 percent on the day. The euro also hit its highest level against the yen innearly a month at 136.09 yen, and last traded up 0.7 percent at135.55 yen. The dollar was up 0.5 percent at 95.24 yen, after hitting asession peak of 95.38 yen, the highest in almost three weeks. INVESTORS REMAIN WARY The dollar has come under pressure in recent sessions asupbeat economic data and largely positive results on the U.S.corporate earnings front fueled expectations the global economywas on the mend. Investors further sold the dollar on Monday after datashowing sales of new U.S. single-family homes rose 11 percentin June from the prior month. Analysts said the data added to evidence that the housingsector, which led the economy into the current recession, wasstarting to rebound. On a three-month moving average basis, thereport suggested that new-home sales hit a bottom in Januaryand are starting to increase slightly. Some market participants cautioned against reading too muchinto the housing numbers. "The data this morning was better than expected but peopledid a 180-degree turn after they saw prices were still down --close to 6 percent," said Matt Kassel, director of FX tradingat ING Capital Markets in New York. "You see something comes off 6 to 10 percent, you will losea little bit of inventory and that's clearly what took placethere. So I don't think it's all that great and you see theeuro come off its highs." Analysts said the recent surge in market optimism may beginto fade as caution sets in ahead of U.S. gross domestic productdata on Friday. A Reuters polls showed markets are expectingthat the U.S. economy declined 1.5 percent in the secondquarter compared with a 5.5 percent contraction in the firstthree months of the year.
