<raw><![CDATA[ SEOUL, May 31 (Reuters) - The heads of the U.S. FederalReserve and the European Central Bank on Monday both singledout emerging economies as key to global financial stability. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the worldeconomy depends ever more on emerging markets to maintainstrong domestic growth and economic and financial stability. "Improvements in emerging market policies and policyframeworks ... have ramifications beyond the emerging marketeconomies themselves," he said in videotaped remarks preparedfor delivery to a conference sponsored by the Bank of Korea. Bernanke did not discuss the outlook for the U.S. economyor interest rates.  His remarks were echoed by European Central Bank PresidentJean-Claude Trichet who said in separate videotaped comments tothe conference that emerging economies have been a source ofstrength in the global financial crisis. "One distinctive aspect of this crisis has been itsoriginating in industrial economies. Emerging countries havealso been severely affected, but as a group remained a sourceof strength for the world economy," Trichet said in theprepared comments. Commenting on South Korea, Bernanke said actions taken byits government and central bank since the Asian financialcrisis of the late 1990s helped it weather the crisis thatswept economies around the world in 2007-2009. South Korea had amassed a budget and trade surplus andpushed banks to prepare for shocks, Bernanke said. In addition,its central bank's move to focus on domestic price stabilityrather than on stabilising exchange rates also helped thecountry during the turmoil. As a result of a formal inflation-targeting regime adoptedby South Korea's central bank in 1998, it could lower ratesduring the crisis without scaring investors off, Bernanke said. "In earlier crises, foreign investors were not inclined togive emerging market policy makers the benefit of the doubtwhen they promised low inflation and sustainable fiscalpolicies," he said.
