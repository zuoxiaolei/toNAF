<raw><![CDATA[ * AgMin sees 780,000 tonnes poultry imports in 2010 * Comments come as U.S. chicken banned  By Aleksandras Budrys MOSCOW, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Russia, which has effectivelybanned U.S. chickens, plans to stop importing poultry altogetherwithin three years, its farm minister said on Monday, setting anew deadline for becoming self-sufficient in that sector. Russia's billion-dollar drive to cut dependency on chickenimports has concerned major foreign suppliers, including theUnited States, which earned about $800 million selling poultryto its biggest export market the year before last. Agriculture Minister Yelena Skrynnik said on Monday thatRussia was importing 780,000 tonnes a year of poultry meat. Thisis the amount set in a 2010 quota. [ID:nLDE5BK0BA] "Within three years, we must cut this to zero," she wasquoted as saying in a statement issued by the ministry. Russia effectively halted U.S. poultry imports when itbanned meat treated with chlorine from Jan. 19. Moscow insiststhe United States should observe its food safety rules, whileU.S. critics have said the bans could be politically motivated. Talks between Russian watchdog bodies and visiting U.S.officials last week ended without any commitment from Moscow toreopen its market. Though more negotiations are planned, Russiahas already moved to secure alternative supplies.[ID:nLDE60K1AZ] Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, speaking after the U.S. bancame into force, said Russia should not only cover its owndomestic needs but export poultry meat in the next four to fiveyears. [ID:nLDE60D1JG]. First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov, who oversees thefarm sector, said in April 2009 that Moscow aimed to becomeself-sufficient in poultry meat and pork -- and even start toexporting meat -- as soon as 2012. [ID:nL3165254] The Russian Poultry Breeders Union, a powerful industrylobby, as well as U.S. experts said at the time that Russiawould still be likely to need poultry imports after 2012.[ID:nLM493293] [ID:nNO9423693] Skrynnik said the government planned to prepare federal andregional programmes to develop domestic poultry breeding in theperiod to 2015. She said only 22 of Russia's 83 regions were self-sufficientin poultry meat. Poultry production in 2009 rose by 13 percentover 2008, she said, without providing tonnages. The Poultry Breeders Union estimated 2008 domestic poultrymeat output at 2.3 million tonnes. {ID:nLM493293] As Russia develops its poultry breeding, it has cut importtariff quotas, under which suppliers may ship determined volumesof poultry meat at a discount import tariff. Volumes are beingcut to 550,000 tonnes in 2012 from 952,000 tonnes in 2009.             ]]></raw>
