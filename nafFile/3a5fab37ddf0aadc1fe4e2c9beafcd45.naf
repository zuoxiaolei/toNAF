<raw><![CDATA[ LUXEMBOURG, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Portugal's political partiesshould unite behind the government's 2011 budget that includesdrastic spending cuts, the chairman of the group of euro zonefinance ministers said on Monday. The opposition Social Democrats have declined to say whetherthey will give the unpopular government the support it needs topass the budget. "We do hope that the major parties will join in making theseefforts so that the Portuguese parliament will adopt the budgetfor 2011," Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker told a newsconference. He was speaking after European Union finance ministersagreed on Monday that member states should face almost automaticsanctions for breaching EU deficit and debt limits. Portugal's minority Socialist government included deepspending cuts and tax increases in the 2011 budget that itpresented last week, but must win the support of the oppositionfor the bill to pass in parliament. Portugal announced spending cuts in May but then came underpressure from financial markets and Brussels to do more. The government has targeted a deficit of 7.3 percent of GDPthis year and 4.6 percent next year.  "The governments in (Greece, Ireland and Portugal) will beable to meet the fiscal targets with the consolidation measuresthat they have taken and they are also taking very substantialefforts in structural reforms," European Economic and MonetaryAffairs Commissioner Olli Rehn told reporters. The risk premiums on Portuguese bonds hit euro lifetimehighs at the end of last month on concerns about its ability tocut the budget deficit The spreads have narrowed to their tightest levels in nearlytwo months but failure to pass the budget could send them up again, making it more onerous for the government to borrow oninternational markets.
