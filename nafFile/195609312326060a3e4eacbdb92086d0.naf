<raw><![CDATA[The number of mortgage applications in the United States dropped last week for the first time in a month, the Mortgage Bankers Association’s index of loan applications showed on Wednesday.  The Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, decreased 10.9% on a seasonally adjusted basis from the preceding week, the association said.  On an unadjusted basis, the index decreased 10.1% compared with the previous week and decreased 19.8% compared with the same week one year earlier, according to the group.  “Refinance activity fell substantially last week,” said Michael Fratantoni, MBA’s vice president of research and economics.  “Although rates remain low, there appears to be a smaller pool of borrowers who are willing and able to refinance at today’s rates.”             ]]></raw>
