<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro was trading close to a three-day low against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, as renewed concerns over Spain's financial troubles weighed on demand for the single currency, overshadowing earlier economic data from Germany and the euro zone.EUR/USD hit 1.3047 during European afternoon trade, the pair's lowest since September 14; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3067, shedding 0.38%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.2985, the low of September 14 and resistance at 1.3172, Monday's high.Sentiment on the euro remained under pressure after Reuters reported earlier that Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy remains uncertain about asking for help from the European Central Bank's new bond-purchasing program, which would mean signing up to a permanent bailout fund. Spain's government faced protests over the weekend against public spending cuts, even as Madrid told its European partners that its next steps to overhaul the economy would avoid further cuts in public spending. Concerns over the handling of Spain's debt woes overshadowed earlier data showing that the ZEW Centre for Economic Research's index of economic sentiment for Germany improved more-than-expected in September, ticking up to minus 18.2 from a reading of minus 25.5 the previous month. Analysts had expected the index to improve to minus 19 in September.The ZEW index of economic sentiment for the euro zone improved to minus 3.8 in September from minus 21.2 the previous month, beating expectations for a reading of minus 16.5.Also Tuesday, Madrid sold EUR3.56 billion worth of 12-month government bonds, at an average yield of 2.83%, down from 3.07% at a previous auction. The Spanish Treasury also sold EUR1.02 billion worth of 18-month bonds, at a yield of 3.07%, down from 3.33%.Following the auctions, the yield of Spanish 10-year government bonds was at 5.90%, close to the 6% threshold, which is widely seen as unsustainable in the long term.Elsewhere, the euro was lower against the pound with EUR/GBP dropping 0.39%, to hit 0.8040.Earlier in the day, official data showed that consumer price inflation in the U.K. ticked down to an annualized rate of 2.5% in August, from 2.6% the previous month, in line with expectations.Later Tuesday, the U.S. was to release official data on the current account, as well as a report on the balance of domestic and foreign investment in long-term securities.             ]]></raw>
