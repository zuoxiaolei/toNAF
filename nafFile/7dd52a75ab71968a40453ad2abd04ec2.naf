<raw><![CDATA[ By Tamawa Desai LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Foreign exchange derivativesactivity surged in the final three months of 2009 with turnoverrising to a record high, possibly reflecting an increase incarry trades, the Bank for International Settlements said. Turnover measured by notional amounts rose by 15 percent to$8 trillion, the highest on record, the BIS said in itsquarterly report published Sunday. Open interest increased by 11 percent to $310 billion, itsaid. "The data provide some support for the notion of the(renewed) attractiveness of foreign exchange carry trades," thereport said. Carry trades, popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, area trading scheme where investors raise funds throughlow-yielding currencies to invest in higher-yieldinginstruments. The BIS report noted open interest in two of the mostattractive target currencies -- Australian dollar and Brazilianreal -- had increased considerably since the height of theglobal financial crisis. But it said the funding currencies had changed from previousbouts of carry trade activity, though it was difficult to saywith what they had been replaced. Volumes for the two traditional funding currencies -- theJapanese yen and Swiss franc, had fallen in the three months toDecember last year. "Short-term interest rates are low in a number of largeeconomies, which has expanded the number of possible fundingcurrencies," it said. In a separate feature, BIS economist Marion Kohler saidcarry trade activty may have returned in the second half of 2009as extreme risk aversion had abated, and that may have promptedbigger fluctuations in exchange rates during and after therecent global financial crisis. Data also showed turnover had risen sharply for the Swissfranc. "Most of this appears to reflect higher short-term tradingrather than longer-term position-taking, as open interest inderivatives on the franc fell," the report said. The Swiss central bank has been actively intervening in thecurrency market since March last year to stem excessive rises inits currency as part of measures to halt deflation.
