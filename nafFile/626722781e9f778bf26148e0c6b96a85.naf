<raw><![CDATA[  * Risk appetite falls; stocks, commodities decline * Yen gains broadly, Australian, New Zealand dollars fall * Investors wary that rally in risky assets is excessive (Recasts, updates prices and changes byline) By Nick Olivari NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The dollar and yen rallied onThursday in revived safe-haven demand for the U.S. andJapanese currencies with the pullback in risk appetiteillustrated by declines in equity and commodity markets. The dollar and commodities are often inversely correlated,with gold and oil priced in dollars and seen as an alternativecurrency and hard asset themselves. Analysts said investors were turning cautious after recenteconomic data has not been as rosy as forecast, increasingworries that the sharp rally in risky assets over the pastseveral months may have been overdone. The yen rallied broadly, hitting its highest level againstthe euro in more than two weeks, while the higher-yielding,commodity-linked Australian and New Zealand dollars tumbled. "It's probably a combination of the notion that the globaleconomic data has been going through somewhat of a soft patchrecently and the fact that the year-end is approaching," saidVassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at Wells Fargo in NewYork. In mid-afternoon New York trade, the euro fell 0.4 percentto $1.4911. It remained within the range of a large $1.48 to$1.51 "double no touch" options structure expiring on Friday. A senior economic adviser to the German government toldReuters Television that Germany could face a double-diprecession in late 2010 or early 2011 as extra public spendingis withdrawn.  The single euro-zone currency also slid to a more thantwo-week low against the yen, according to Reuters data, aslosses accelerated after breaking technical support at the200-day moving average of around 132.00. The euro later rebounded to 132.58 yen, still down 0.9percent for the day in volatile trading with almost 2 yenseparating the day's high and low. The dollar fell 0.5 percent to 88.91 yen after hitting alow of 88.64, the lowest level since Oct. 9, according toReuters data. "The decline in risk appetite has prompted some squaringof positions particularly in the yen, which was oversoldagainst the majors," said Michael Woolfolk, senior currencystrategist at BNY Mellon in New York. RISKY ASSETS PULL BACK The three major U.S. stock indexes fell sharply, down 1.2percent to 1.8 percent in early afternoon trading. Oil andgold prices both retreated a day after gold hit a record highabove $1,150 an ounce. Investors were also wary of talk from emerging marketcountries about capital controls to limit some of the hotmoney flows into their economies, with new steps announced byBrazil and South Korea. The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, a non-tradedcalculation measuring the greenback's performance against abasket of six currencies, rose 0.2 percent to 75.31. The indexhit a 15-month low of 74.679 earlier this week. Some 10,379 contracts changed hands in the December dollarindex futures, with average daily volume year to date at8,286, and the futures last at 75.425. Open interest wasposted at 40,085. Federal Reserve officials on Thursday downplayed theconsequences of the falling U.S. dollar, underscoring thatdeflation is still a threat, especially with commercial realestate prices falling. A survey on Thursday showed factory activity in the U.S.Mid-Atlantic region grew in November for a fourth straightmonth, which was faster than expected, but that was not enoughto offset general economic gloom. The Australian dollar fell to a two-week low and lasttraded 1.2 percent lower at US$0.9182. The New Zealand dollarlost 2.1 percent to US$0.7304.
