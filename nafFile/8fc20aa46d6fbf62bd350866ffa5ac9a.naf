<raw><![CDATA[   * C$ ends at 97.21 U.S. cents * U.S. dollar strength key driver behind C$ drop * Bond prices soften across curve (Updates to close, adds quote) By Jennifer Kwan TORONTO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar retreatedagainst the U.S. currency on Wednesday as the greenback rosebroadly on speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve would take ameasured approach to quantitative easing. The U.S. dollar's rise pushed it into positive territoryagainst major currencies for the year as investors continued tounwind bets against the greenback before a highly anticipatedFederal Reserve meeting next week. [FRX/] Doubts over how aggressively the Fed is going to be withanother round of asset-buying to stimulate a faltering recoveryalso weighed on global equities and commodities. [MKTS/GLOB] "It comes down to the U.S. dollar, and the U.S. dollarstrength or weakness is simply a barometer of the market'sassumption around quantitative easing at the next Fed meeting,"said Jack Spitz, managing director of foreign exchange atNational Bank Financial. "The current market position is to be short U.S. dollarsand the U.S. dollar's gains over the past few days havereflected a pulling back of risk," he said. The Canadian dollar  ended at C$1.0287 to the U.S.dollar, or 97.21 U.S. cents, down from Tuesday's finish atC$1.0242 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.64 U.S. cents. The U.S. central bank has aired several times that it willattempt to boost growth by pumping more money into the economythrough government bond purchases, commonly referredto as quantitative easing. That has pushed the dollar and U.S.bond yields lower. But the greenback reversed course this week on uncertaintyabout how much the Fed will spend and whether the new measureswill be carried out swiftly or phased in over time. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the Fedis likely to unveil an asset purchase program next week worth afew hundred billion dollars over several months, and thatofficials wanted to avoid a "shock and awe" style approach.[ID:nTOE69Q02H] "As the market scales back its expectations on QE(quantitative easing), it scales back its short dollarpositions," said Spitz. BONDS LOWER Canadian government bond prices softened, tracking U.S.Treasuries lower as traders trimmed bets on the size ofpossible asset buying by the Fed. [US/] "The move is generally in line with what we saw in theU.S.," said Kam Bath, fixed income strategist at RBC Capitalmarkets. "It's people paring down their expectations of Fed stimulusnext week," he added. "That would explain the underperformanceat the belly of the curve because that's where expectationsfor Fed purchases were largely concentrated." The two-year bond  fell 5 Canadian cents to yield1.451 percent, while the 10-year bond  was off 58Canadian cents to yield 2.884 percent.
