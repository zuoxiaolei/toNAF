<raw><![CDATA[  * Worries about French banking sector hit euro * Swiss franc falls against dollar after SNB measures * Dollar/yen close to record lows, intervention risk rises (Adds comment, updates prices, changes byline) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The euro fell against mostmajor currencies  on Wednesday, while commodity currenciesdropped on persistent global economic uncertainty and worriesabout French banks with large exposure to peripheral euro zonedebt. French bank stocks were hit hard in Paris trading, withSociete Generale  shares closing down 15 percent. ASociete Generale spokeswoman denied all market rumors about thebank. It also asked France's stock market regulator to launchan investigation into the source of the rumors. Sharp losses in the French banking sector spilled over tothe U.S. stock market, which has yet to recover from Friday'sU.S. credit rating downgrade by Standard & Poor's. "The sell-off in the euro appears to be a risk-related movein general,' said Bob Lynch, global head of G10 currencystrategy, at HSBC in New York. "U.S. stocks were quite weak at the open. They havestabilized to lower levels since then and that has been thepattern as well for euro/dollar." The euro last traded down 1.0 percent at $1.42310, aftersliding to a session low of $1.41620 on trading platform EBS. It lost 1.4 percent against the yen to 109.19 yen, after sliding to a roughly five-month low at108.300. It was the euro's worst performance against the yen in amonth. The euro zone common currency also came under pressure onearlier market talk of a possible downgrade of France's AAAcredit rating. The country is seen as vulnerable after Standard& Poor's cut the United States' credit rating by one notch toAA-plus last Friday. But those concerns faded after all three major ratingsagencies -- Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's -- reaffirmedtheir AAA ratings on France with a stable outlook. SWISS FRANC PULLS BACK The euro dropped 0.2 percent to 1.03630 Swiss francs. The franc soared as high as 1.00750 per euro onTuesday, edging close to parity. Implied volatility, a measure of the market's expectationsof future movements, remained at extreme levels, with one-montheuro/Swiss franc implied vols  rising above 29percent. The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 76.760 yen. It hit a sessionlow of 76.347 on EBS , close to its record low hit inMarch of 76.25 and keeping investors wary that Japaneseauthorities may step in again to stem gains in the currency. Traders said there doesn't seem to be much action indollar/yen as investors on Wednesday preferred to go long theJapanese currency versus the euro. The single euro zone stillhas a long way to go before it hits record lows seen inmid-March. The dollar jumped 0.8 percent against the Swiss franc to0.72825 franc  after the Swiss National Bank said itwould significantly boost franc supply in the coming days in abid to stem the currency's rally to record highs and is stilllooking at a whole range of measures to slow the franc's surge.For details, see [ID:nL6E7JA1VK] [ID:nL6E7JA0BI] The dollar plunged more than 5 percent against the franc atone point on Tuesday, its worst trading day ever. Analysts, however, said the SNB's measures would do littleto halt exceptionally strong demand for the safe-haven francafter the Federal Reserve on Tuesday underlined the state ofthe struggling U.S. economy and promised to hold interest rateslow for at least two years. [ID:nL6E7JA0BI] [ID:nN1E7781WQ] Goldman Sachs said it expects dollar-negative forces tostrengthen and recommends that clients go short on the U.S.dollar on additional easing from the Fed. "The Fed yesterday shifted to a more dovish stance,"Goldman wrote in a note to clients. "The Fed also said itstands ready to increase its balance sheet further, leading ourU.S. economists to think (a third round of quantitative easing)now has a more than even chance of becoming reality." "All this suggests the dollar will likely continue toweaken on a broad basis," the bank said. The higher-yielding Australian dollar  dropped 0.8percent against the U.S. currency, while the New Zealand dollar slumped 2.4 percent. Sterling fell 0.9 percent to $1.6165 after the Bank ofEngland cut its growth and inflation forecasts . (Additional reporting by Wanfeng Zhou; Editing by Diane Craft)             ]]></raw>
