U.S. employers unexpectedly cut 85,000 jobs in December,government data showed on Friday, with the unemployment rateunchanged at 10 percent in December, cooling optimism on thelabor market's recovery  [ID:nN07203048] The Labor Department said November payrolls were revised toshow the economy actually added 4,000 jobs in that month ratherthan losing 11,000 as initially reported. With revisions toOctober, however, the economy lost 1,000 more jobs thanpreviously estimated over the two months. "The unemployment rate of 10 percent will continue topressure the Fed. to maintain its current accommodative stanceand that will hurt the dollar," said Andrew Bekoff, chiefinvestment officer for Family Office Group in New York. In the first full trading week of 2009, the euro rose 0.1percent  against the dollar, while the dollar fell 0.1percent against the yen . That reversed the trading trend for the month of December,2009, where the euro fell 4.6 percent against the dollar andthe dollar gained 7.6 percent against the yen.

"The Fed funds market, which may have gotten ahead ofitself in December in pricing in an early Fed hike, has alreadypared back expectations in January, a factor that will helpsupport the use of the dollar as a low yielding currency forfunding risk on trades," said Brown Brothers Harriman.
