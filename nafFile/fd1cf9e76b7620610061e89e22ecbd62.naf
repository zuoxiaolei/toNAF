<raw><![CDATA[ * Germany ready to contribute to capital increase * Central bank may seek funds to ward against bond losses * Trichet calls for more flexible euro zone rescue fund * Euro bonds off agenda at EU summit (adds ECB to discuss this week, Belgium, Slovakia) By Dave Graham and Sakari Suoninen BERLIN/FRANKFURT, Dec 14 (Reuters) - European Unionpaymaster Germany said on Tuesday it would support giving theEuropean Central Bank more capital to help fight a sovereigndebt crisis that continues to shake the euro zone. ECB sources told Reuters the bank's governing council wouldconsider at a meeting on Wednesday and Thursday whether to seeka capital increase from euro zone members to cover the risk oflosses on government bonds it has bought to support the16-nation single currency area. A Berlin government official, briefing reporters ahead of anEU summit on Thursday and Friday, said ECB President Jean-ClaudeTrichet might raise the matter at a dinner with EU leaders. "The government supports the ECB in all that it deemsimportant ... If such a request comes, we will judge itpositively," said the official, speaking on condition ofanonymity. The ECB declined comment. The German official said a bigger capital base would showfinancial markets that the central bank had the firepower to buynew government bonds if needed. One euro zone central bank source said the ECB was eyeing adoubling of its subscribed capital of almost 5.8 billion euros,which compares to a balance sheet of 138 billion euros,according to its latest annual report. The summit is due to approve a German-driven treaty changeto create a permanent crisis-resolution mechanism that couldforce private investors to share losses with taxpayers if a eurozone country was unable to repay its debt after 2013. Trichet called in comments released on Tuesday for EUleaders to give maximum flexibility in size and scope to theeuro zone's existing financial safety net, known as the EuropeanFinancial Stability Facility (EFSF). The rescue fund is limited by rules that specify it can onlybe used as a last resort and a requirement to maintain a cashbuffer to preserve its top-notch AAA credit rating.  MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY A senior EU source said experts were exploring ways aroundboth restrictions to ensure the full 440 billion euros earmarkedfor the fund can be lent, and to provide a flexible credit linebefore a country is shut out of capital markets. "On the EFSF, I can say we are calling for maximumflexibility and I would say maximum capacity quantitatively andqualitatively," Trichet said at a Frankfurt InternationalBusiness Journalists' Club event late on Monday. Ireland became the first country to seek assistance from theEFSF this month as part of an 85 billion euro EU/IMF rescueafter a banking crash swelled its public debt. Greece received a110 billion euro EU/IMF bailout in May just before the rescuefund was created. The German official said no other country was in imminentneed of EFSF aid. But Portugal and Spain are under bond marketpressure to follow suit due to their high budget deficits andloss of economic competitiveness. Spain had to pay a sharply higher yield than last month tosell 2.51 billion euros in 12- and 18-month bills on Tuesdayafter a renewed market sell-off that has driven up borrowingcosts for Madrid and other vulnerable euro zone sovereigns. In another sign of ebbing confidence in euro zonesovereigns, credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut itsoutlook for Belgian debt to negative on Tuesday, flagging a newrisk for money markets. The wealthy west European country hasbeen run by a caretaker government since elections six monthsago and has a debt-to-GDP ratio of nearly 100 percent. Germany and its allies are seeking to prevent any discussionat the EU summit of a proposal by two veteran finance ministersfor common euro zone bonds as a way to prevent speculationagainst member states' debt and reduce their borrowing costs. Berlin fears such bonds would raise its borrowing costs andreduce pressure on heavily indebted governments to put theirfinances into better order. Slovakian Prime Minister Iveta Radicova said the "E-bonds"idea, raised by Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of euro zonefinance ministers, and Italian Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti,was not on the summit agenda and was "permanently unacceptable".  LOSSES FEARED ECB sources suggested the central bank wanted more capitalchiefly to protect itself against potential losses rather thanfund any major increase of euro zone government debt purchases. "The issue is that the ECB is worried about potential lossesfrom its bond buying," one source said. "At the moment we are buying very modest amounts, but whatif that is increased, and what if the bonds you buy are suddenlyworth 30 percent less?" the source said, referring to the riskof a writedown on a euro zone government's debt. The ECB disclosed on Monday that it had increased purchasesof euro zone government bonds to 2.667 billion euros ($3.5billion) last week from 1.965 billion euros the previous week.It was the biggest weekly total since June but well below levelsseen at the height of the euro zone crisis. Altogether, the ECB has bought 72 billion euros in bonds --exclusively Greek, Irish and Portuguese, analysts believe --since it began intervening in May to stabilise markets.  ECB policymakers have repeatedly signalled that the centralbank cannot bear the brunt of fire-fighting against bond marketattacks on highly indebted euro zone states, urging governmentsto increase reform efforts and boost EU contingency funds. Trichet urged euro zone countries to take action to ensuretheir banking sectors are "appropriately restructured". The ECBis worried that ailing banks in weaker euro area countries havebecome totally dependent on central bank funding, making itharder to withdraw emergency liquidity support measures. Figures released on Tuesday showed Spanish banks borrowedless from the ECB last month as funding conditions continued toimprove. But Greek banks became even more dependent on the ECBlifeline, borrowing 95.1 billion euros in November, the Bank ofGreece said.(additional reporting by Marc Jones in Frankfurt, Paul Carrelin Berlin, Martin Santa in Bratislava, Nigel Davies in Madridand George Georgiopoulos in Athens; writing by Paul Taylor,editing by Mike Peacock, John Stonestreet)             ]]></raw>
