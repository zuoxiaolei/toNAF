<raw><![CDATA[* Germany set to budge for all-inclusive euro deal * Signals on Greek debt buyback, bigger rescue fund * Merkel pressing for EU to adopt German-style reforms * Regional elections dictate tough bargaining  By Stephen Brown BERLIN, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Germany's resistance to expandinga euro zone bailout fund and easing Greece's debt burden seemsto be softening as it scents a grand bargain in which Europeanstates would commit to tough German-style economic reforms. Berlin officials still insist in public there is no need toincrease the size of the European Financial Stability Facility(EFSF), and reject the possibility that Greece may be forcedinto some form of debt restructuring. But in private they are setting out the negotiating positionfor what Berlin sees as a package deal to be agreed in March,ranging from altering the terms of Greek debt to ambitiousreforms of European pay and pensions. Senior German officials tell Reuters the government is nowactively discussing practical options for expanding the role ofthe EFSF to alleviate Greece's debt dilemma. One option would be to empower the fund to lend Greece moneyto buy back its own bonds in the market at a discount. "But we have different opinions in the government. Some wantit, some don't," said one official, who asked not to be named. In a sign of Berlin's evolving position, Finance MinisterWolfgang Schaeuble repeatedly declined in a weekend televisioninterview to rule out the possibility that Greece might need toreschedule its debt. Many investors believe Greece cannot sustain payments ondebt projected to reach 158 percent of economic output in 2013under a 110 billion euro EU/International Monetary Fund bailout. Since the crisis reignited due to fears about Greece'sability to avoid a debt restructuring and about EFSF's abilityto cope with possible contagion to Portugal, Spain and beyond,Berlin has again been accused of dragging its feet. Chancellor Angela Merkel attacked the European Commissionfor publicly seeking an increase in the EFSF, which can actuallylend far less than its 440 billion euro headline figure due tothe need to hold money in reserve to ensure a top credit rating. So far, Berlin has spoken only about ways of maximising theexisting sum, but ministers hint privately they may be preparedto go further if assured it will be a "one shot" solution.  NO "SALAMI SLICING" The government has warned euro zone partners against a"salami-slicing" approach because, with seven state electionsthis year, it cannot afford to go to parliament repeatedly toask for additional aid, senior EU sources say. "We must address these goals in one comprehensive package sowe don't have to readjust it every few months," Schaeuble toldWirtschaftsWoche business magazine. One factor in the background is horse-trading over who willsucceed Jean-Claude Trichet as head of the European Central Banklate this year, although no one suggests openly that support forGerman central banker Axel Weber is part of the euro bargain. It may be no accident that Weber has floated a plan to easeGreece's debt burden without a default by extending the rescueloans for 30 years, casting himself as an architect of thepossible solution to the euro zone crisis. Merkel has said repeatedly that Germany will do "whatever ittakes" to save the single currency, reiterating that messagelast week in Davos after France's Nicolas Sarkozy. In a drive to lower the political cost of rescuing the euroand shed her role as a nay-sayer at EU summits, she has gone onthe offensive, demanding a major shakeup of Europe's retirementand wage-bargaining systems and of divergent corporate taxes. A paper from her office sets out reforms that, if imposed onEurope, might convince Germany's voters and constitutional court-- due to rule on the legality the EU rescue fund this year --that Merkel is not throwing good money after bad.[ID:nLDE70R1XX] It calls for euro zone states to emulate Germany's "debtbrake" constitutional amendment for fiscal discipline and movetowards its retirement age goal of 67, which would be difficultfor many European leaders including Sarkozy, whose more modestpension reforms aroused huge protests last year. Spreading such measures across Europe would "inspireinvestor confidence and have the advantage of making it easierfor us politically", said one German source. The paper seems influenced by less pro-European advisersthan Schaeuble, a 68-year-old veteran of Merkel's ChristianDemocrats (CDU), whose stern but flexible approach to the crisiscontrasts with that of cabinet hardliners.  "GOOD RESULTS" After her re-election in 2009, the centre-right chancellor'spopularity fell last year amid voter anger at the Greek bailoutin May and the creation of a rescue mechanism for other states. Those moves contributed to the CDU's defeat in a stateelection in North Rhine-Westphalia that cost Merkel her majorityin the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament which representsthe 16 federal states. Fresh losses in regional elections such as in conservativeindustrial bastion Baden-Wuerttemberg on March 27 would furtherhinder Merkel's ability to legislate. Officials say tentative proposals to bring forward a eurocrisis summit by a few weeks from late March respond not tocomplaints about German "procrastination" but to worries aboutthe impact on regional elections. [ID:nLDE70R26G] Domestic politics is shaping the argument within the Germangovernment over the content as well as the timing of theresponse, with Merkel keen to avoid taxpayers feeling they arebeing sacrificed for European largesse. One coalition party in particular, the Free Democrats led byVice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, publiclyopposes expanding the EFSF, striking a tough stance in hopes ofreviving flagging support in state elections. But even Westerwelle, after being lobbied by fellow liberalEuropean Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn, told anewspaper that expanding the EFSF was "no taboo" for his party,and Germany's reticence was a negotiating position. "I want good results. You don't get that if you declare yourprice in public beforehand or draw lines in the sand," he said.
