<raw><![CDATA[   * Says yuan move will help reduce global imbalances * Interest rate moves hard to predict due to uncertainty * Urges global action to fix imbalances, sovereign debt (Changes dateline, adds quotes, details) By Rod Nickel WINNIPEG, June 22 (Reuters) - China's move to let itscurrency appreciate will help reduce global imbalances and takesome pressure off the Canadian dollar, and ultimately benefitthe Canadian economy, a Bank of Canada official said onTuesday. The Chinese currency's peg to the U.S. dollar had "put moreof the burden of adjustment on other currencies, includingours," Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Timothy Lane saidfollowing a speech in Winnipeg. "We would see ... policies for more balanced global growthand the rotation of demand as being something that would takesome pressure off the Canadian dollar and basically bebeneficial to the Canadian economy." Lane said the value of the Canadian currency against theU.S. dollar would affect the central bank's decision oninterest rates on July 20 and beyond. "Clearly that is, as I mentioned earlier, a factor that, atcurrent levels it has been dampening the recovery in Canada,and certainly that would be one of the factors that we takeinto consideration in deciding, in assessing the outlook forthe Canadian economy in the future, and would therefore be afactor in our decisions on monetary policy." The the Canadian dollar was at C$1.0223 to the U.S. dollar,or 97.82 U.S. cents early Tuesday morning. Lane also repeated the bank's mantra that any furtherinterest rate hikes are difficult to predict due touncertainties in the global economy, particularly regardingEuropean debt woes. "Because of the uncertainties -- particularly thoseemanating from Europe -- we've been careful to emphasize thatthe extent and timing of any additional withdrawal of monetarystimulus would depend on how the outlook for economic activityand inflation evolves," Lane said in the prepared text of aspeech he was giving in Winnipeg. The Canadian economy has grown at robust rates for twoquarters but the clip is expected to moderate in the secondquarter, Lane said. In a report on Monday, the bank said most of the risks tothe Canadian financial system come from beyond the country'sborders. In his speech, Lane focused on two main risks: globalimbalances and sovereign debt. To rebalance global growth, countries that are runningcurrent account surpluses need to increase domestic spending,while deficit countries need to decrease theirs, he said. "In this regard, China's recent decision to enhance theflexibility of its exchange rate is an important step forward;its full implementation will contribute to strong, sustainable,and balanced global economic growth," he said. The consequence of countries not making the right policychanges could be another crisis, he said. To ensure leadingeconomies are on the right track they should submit to mutualassessment by their G20 peers in a process that he said wasstill being worked out. "Each member country will submit its policies to the G20for assessment by other members, with a view to promotingcoherence among macroeconomic policies," he said. On the issue of sovereign debt, Lane urged countries tocommit to austerity now and not postpone painful decisions,saying "promises of future action are rarely enough to convincemarkets."
