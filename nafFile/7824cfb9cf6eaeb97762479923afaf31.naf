<raw><![CDATA[  * Brazil central bank seen holding rates at 10.75 pct * Tightening cycle could resume next year * Lower rates could help presidential candidate Rousseff (Adds comment, updates yields) By Ana Nicolaci da Costa BRASILIA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank isexpected to hold interest rates steady later on Wednesday,ending a monetary tightening cycle that helped cool a red-hoteconomy as the country gears up for a presidential election. Policymakers are expected to keep the so-called Selic rate at 10.75 percent at the conclusion of a two-daymonetary policy meeting after markets close, according to mosteconomists surveyed by Reuters. For more, see: The central bank has lifted the Selic by 200 basis pointssince April, when the rate stood at an all-time low of 8.75percent. But with the economy cooling from its torrid pace in thefirst quarter and inflation slowing, analysts see room for thebank to hold rates steady through the end of the year. However,interest rates could start climbing again in 2011. "To bring inflation back to the center of the target,they'll need to start the tightening process again at the startof the year," said Jankiel Santos, chief economist for BESInvestimento in Sao Paulo. The Selic could end 2011 at 12 percent, he said -- stilllower than the 13.75 percent rate as recently as last year,marking a new era for Brazilian interest rates.Brazil shook off the global economic crisis more quicklythan many developed economies, chalking up Chinese-level growthrates in the first quarter that prompted fears of overheating. As the central bank raised interest rates and thegovernment phased out tax breaks for key industries, theeconomy cooled and inflation slowed.

Lower interest rates could be good news for presidentialfrontrunner Dilma Rousseff, the ruling party candidate in theOctober elections. Rousseff has a double-digit opinion polllead over opposition contender Jose Serra, a vocal critic ofthe bank's decision to raise interest rates earlier this year. Rousseff is backed by the hugely popular President LuizInacio Lula da Silva, who has given the central bank autonomyto set interest rates without political interference. Cooling activity has already crept into inflation data,with consumer prices unexpectedly falling in the month tomid-August and analysts revising down their inflationexpectations for 2010 for the second straight week in a weeklycentral bank survey. They now expect inflation to end the year at 5.07 percent,near the government target of 4.5 percent, plus or minus twopercentage points.
