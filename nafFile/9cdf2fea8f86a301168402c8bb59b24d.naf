<raw><![CDATA[  * Euro gains as euro zone inflation data tops estimates * Sterling soars; Egypt unrest spreading still a risk (Updates prices, adds comment, detail on U.S. data, Fed)By Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - A jump in euro zone inflationlifted the euro above $1.37 on Monday and bolstered the viewinterest rates in the region could rise more quickly than inthe United States and other advanced economies. That helped the euro reverse the losses it suffered onFriday as unrest in Egypt drove up oil prices and sparked asafe-haven bid for dollars and Swiss francs. Asian central banks and some Middle East accounts wereamong the most active euro buyers, traders said, and some saidthe euro could renew a march toward $1.40 in the weeks ahead,provided trouble in Egypt does not spread to other countries. Brad Bechtel, managing director at FX execution firm FarosTrading in Stamford, Connecticut, said inflation expectationsand month-end buying could drive the euro to $1.3750, adding"$1.40 is still on the cards" if Egypt tensions die down. While protesters filled the streets of Cairo for a seventhstraight day, investors seemed to take heart that violence anddisorder had at least not worsened. [ID:nLDE70U00B] "After Friday, people anticipated coming in to chaos andanarchy in Egypt. When that didn't happen, a lot of shorts werecaught wrong-footed," said Boris Schlossberg, director ofresearch at GFT Forex. The euro rose as high as $1.3739  and was last up 0.6percent at $1.3700. Overnight, $1.3570, the 50 percentretracement of its November-to-January decline, acted assupport, bringimmng in buyers from Asia and the Middle East. Sterling jumped 1 percent to $1.6014 , lifted by eurogains in a reverse of Friday's losses. The euro also roseagainst the Swiss franc  and yen . The dollarwas down 0.2 percent at 81.96 yen . Weekend reports that the European Union was working on asolution to reduce Greece's debt burden also helped boost theeuro, traders said. [ID:nLDE70U087] Schlossberg, however, said the potential for more unrest inEgypt will make it "a tough slog" for the euro to break $1.40or sterling to rise to $1.62 in the near term. Crude oil , reflecting uncertainty about events inEgypt, swung between gains and losses in New York beforepushing above $90 per barrel in late morning. It was some 4percent above Friday's low. INFLATION, EGYPT AND FED POLICY Data showing euro zone inflation rose 2.4 percent in theyear to January, above the European Central Bank's 2 percenttarget, boosted the view the ECB could hike rates sooner thanthe Federal Reserve.[ID:nBRLVCE7AU]. ECB President Jean-ClaudeTrichet has already warned about price pressures and is due tospeak Thursday after the ECB's monthly meeting. The three-month Euribor rate , a mix ofinterest rate expectations and banks' lending appetite, rose to1.074 percent, the highest since July 2009. [ID:nEAP000437]. Citing a high U.S. jobless rate, the Fed has made it clearit is not close to raising U.S. interest rates from near zero,even as U.S. economic data has shown signs of improvement. Data Monday showed U.S. consumer spending rose for a sixthstraight month in December, while business activity in theMidwest grew more than expected this month. [ID:nN31151915] The Commerce Department said Friday the economy grew 2.9percent last year after shrinking by 2.6 percent in 2009. Some worry that the Fed is underestimating inflation, andemerging market officials have said Fed policy and a weakdollar have worsened inflation outside U.S. borders. Andrew Busch, global currency strategist at BMO CapitalMarkets in Chicago, said higher food costs likely contributedto the timing of unrest in Egypt and Tunisia. "The potential risk is not over," he said. "Food inflationwill continue to drive global instability. Watch to see ifforeign politicians and central bank governors begin to ramp uptheir criticism of Fed monetary policy, which is perceived as acause of global inflation." If trouble in Egypt spreads to other Arab countries "and itpushes up the oil price even more, then that would probablyspark more short-term flows into the dollar," said Karl Olsson,currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
