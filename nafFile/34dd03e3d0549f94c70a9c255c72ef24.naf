<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro off 1-1/2 week low vs dlr, up slightly on day * Stg on backfoot after dovish BoE inflation report * FOMC decision at 1815 GMT awaited (Adds comment, details, updates prices) By Nick Olivari NEW YORK, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped from a1-1/2 week high against the euro on Wednesday and struggledagainst the yen as investors remained cautious ahead of theFederal Reserve's policy statement due later in the session. The focus on the Fed overshadowed a U.S. CommerceDepartment report that indicated the U.S. trade deficit widenedin June to $27.0 billion, as goods imports increased for thefirst time in 11 months on the back of higher oil prices. Sterling stayed under pressure after the Bank of England'squarterly inflation report suggested that markets were pricingin rate hikes too early. "The currency market will at least look for the Fed tosound a bit more optimistic on the state of the U.S. economy,though most eyes will likely be searching for comments on themonetary policy stance with regards to the future ofquantitative easing," said Sacha Tihanyi, currency strategistat Scotia Capital in Toronto. "While a great deal of uncertainty has been introduced bythe Bank of England's actions to expand their QE program, theU.S. dollar would likely suffer should the Fed signal movementin the same direction as dollar bulls would actually be hopingfor a signal that the program would not be extended inSeptember," Tihanyi said. The euro fell to a 1-1/2 week low against the dollar ataround $1.4087 before recovering to trade up 0.1 percent on theday at $1.4158 in early New York trade. The euro was 0.1percent lower against the yen at 135.62 yen. The dollar also eased against the Japanese currency to95.81 yen after earlier reaching the lowest level this week.Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar fell 0.1percent to 79.103. There was little reaction to euro zone industrialproduction data, which unexpectedly fell 0.6 percent in Juneagainst forecasts of a 0.3 percent gain. Sterling fell 0.1 percent at $1.6462 after the Bank ofEngland's quarterly inflation report. The BoE said British inflation will be well below the 2percent target in two years if interest rates were to be liftedin the first quarter, suggesting markets are too early inpricing in rate hikes. "If you look at the Bank of England's projectionsmechanically, they'd appear to suggest no increase in rates forquite some time," said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investecin London. "In that respect the (market) reaction was quiteunderstandable. But it's very early to suggest that policy isgoing to remain on hold for a very long time, given we've seensome strengthening in some of the key economic indicators." The Australian dollar fell 0.7 percent against the U.S.dollar to $0.8235. The Fed is expected to keep U.S. interest rates steady atnear zero at a meeting that concludes Wednesday, but the focusis on whether the central bank will end its program of buyinglong-term government securities amid signs the economy isstabilising from a deep recession. "The market is currently pricing in a 50 percentprobability that the first rate hike will take place at the endof Jan. 10 and Fed comments pointing towards a later date couldbe short-term dollar negative," said analysts at Commerzbank. Norway's central bank held its main interest rate unchangedat a record low of 1.25 percent on Wednesday, in line withanalyst forecasts as the Norwegian economy has shown signs ofstabilisation. The dollar was 1.2 percent lower against the Norwegiancrown, while the euro fell 1.3 percent against the Norwegiancurrency.             ]]></raw>
