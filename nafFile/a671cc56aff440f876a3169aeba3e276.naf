<raw><![CDATA[ * To raise lenders' required reserves by 50 bps * Increases ratio for biggest banks to record 20.5 percent * Increase effective April 21, seventh rise since November * More policy tighening ahead   (Adds quotes, background) By Don Durfee and Sally Huang BEIJING, April 17 (Reuters) - China raised banks' requiredreserves on Sunday for the fourth time this year, extending thefight against excessive liquidity and stubbornly high inflationin the world's second-largest economy. The reserve rate rise, which followed an increase inbenchmark bank interest rates on April 5, was the seventh sinceChina stepped up efforts against inflation in October andunderscored the government's determination to keep the economyon an even keel. The move was not a surprise -- investors predicted moretightening after last week's data showed an acceleration ininflation, and more worryingly, sustained capital inflows thatthreaten to keep inflationary pressure high. "This rise continues the tightening measures of the centralbank," said Lin Songli, an economist with Guosen Securities inBeijing. "The first-quarter GDP shows that the whole economy isgood, so there is still space for tightening." The central bank has also raised interest rates four timessince October, slapped price control measures on certaincommodities, and clamped down on property speculation. But price pressures driven by soaring global commodityprices and abundant liquidity continue to plague the Chineseeconomy.   Central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan said on Saturday thatpolicy tightening will continue for sometime, as inflation ishigher that the government is comfortable with. And last week, Premier Wen Jiabao signalled a hawkish stancefor the coming months, saying that the government would use alltools at its disposal to wrestle inflation under control. The 50-basis-point increase, effective from April 21, liftedthe required reserve ratio for the country's biggest banks to arecord 20.5 percent. It will lock up about 350 billion yuan($53.6 billion) of cash that banks would otherwise be able tolend.  MORE TIGHTENING AHEAD The latest economic data showed China's turbo-chargedeconomic growth barely slowed in the first quarter, giving thegovernment more confidence to press ahead with policytightening. "I think there will be more required reserves hikes in thecoming months, or even this month, but the possibility of aninterest rate rise this month is not that big," said ZhuJianfang, chief economist at Citic Securities in Beijing. The latest Reuters poll conducted on April 6 showed analystsbelieve the central bank will raise banks' required reservesthree times this year by a total of 150 basis points andincrease interest rates just once more this year. But although economists have argued recently that thecentral bank was near the end of its interest rate tighteningcycle, China's economic growth is still cruising near doubledigits and the scope for China's government to continuetightening may be bigger than previously anticipated. "The inflation picture is still worrisome and bank lendingrebounded in March," said Zhao Xijun, economist at RenminUniversity in Beijing. "I think the central bank will raiseinterest rate in the coming weeks -- probably in June." March's inflation data showed consumer prices rising to 5.4percent in the year to March, the fastest rate since July 2008,from 4.9 percent in the first two months of the year. At the root of China's rising prices is the vast amount ofmoney flowing into economy. Reserve requirements are a directway of ring-fencing that excess cash, keeping banks from lendingout a large chunk of it and thereby slowing money growth.  China's foreign exchange reserves swelled by nearly $200billion in the first quarter to more than $3 trillion,indicating hefty capital inflows given that China had a $1.02billion trade deficit during the first three months. Meanwhile, Chinese banks extended 679.4 billion yuan ($104billion) in new local currency loans in March, while the broadM2 measure of money supply rose 16.6 percent from a yearearlier, both above market expectations.
