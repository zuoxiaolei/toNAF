<raw><![CDATA[ * Agreements with Colombia, Panama, South Korea stalled * Obama, Pelosi promised "no timetable" for moving pacts (Adds Democratic aide comment, background on pacts) By Doug Palmer WASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Republican U.S.congressional leaders urged President Barack Obama to work withthem to win approval of long-stalled free trade pacts withColombia, Panama and South Korea as early as possible in 2010. "We agree with you that these trade agreements provideimportant new commercial opportunities that will benefit oureconomy and create jobs without adding to our nation'sstaggering budget deficit," House of Representatives Republicanleader John Boehner and three other top Republicans said in aletter to Obama sent late on Thursday. "We ask that you jump-start the implementation processthrough your leadership, particularly by promoting all three ofthese pending trade agreements when you speak to the nation inyour State of the Union address," they said, referring to anannual speech to Congress usually in late January. The letter followed a meeting between Obama and lawmakerson Wednesday in which Obama spoke favorably about wanting tomove on the stalled agreements, according to Republicancongressional aides. There was no immediate comment from the White House. A House Democratic aide said Obama told the bipartisangroup of lawmakers that he supports expanded trade and that hisNovember trip to Asia reinforced that support. "But he promised no timetable for action, nor did thespeaker," the aide said, referring to Nancy Pelosi, the Houseof Representative's top Democrat. All three agreements have been stalled for a number ofyears, mainly because of concerns raised by Democrats. Supporters see a window of opportunity for Congress toapprove one or more of the trade deals in the first half of2010, before the November congressional elections make that toopolitically difficult. Obama opposed the Colombia and South Korean pacts duringlast year's presidential campaign. But since taking office, hehas pledged to work with both countries and Congress to resolveconcerns blocking approval of the deals. "We offer our full support for your efforts and lookforward to an opportunity to work steadfastly with you toimplement each of these agreements as close to the start ofnext year as possible," the senior Republican lawmakers said. MANY HOUSE DEMOCRATS OPPOSE PACTS Since a large bloc of House Democrats oppose the free tradeagreements, Obama will likely need strong support fromRepublicans to win approval of the pacts. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 10 percent, the WhiteHouse has been looking for ways to create new jobs withoutadding to the already huge budget deficit. Proponents say approval of the free trade pacts would helpdo that. But many Democrats are skeptical and believe tradedeals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement are toblame for U.S. manufacturing jobs moving overseas. U.S. trade officials have been working to resolve labor andtax haven issues blocking the Panama agreement, the smallestand least controversial of the three pacts. Opponents of the Colombia deal say that country must takestronger action to stop violence against trade unionists andpunish those responsible for thousands of killings. The main stumbling block to the South Korean pact isconcern over the agreement's auto provisions. Critics say it is a one-sided deal that will open the U.S.market to more South Korean-made cars, without tearing downhidden barriers that block U.S. auto sales to that country.
