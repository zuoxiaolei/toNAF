Despite the improved market sentiment, which alsoencouraged some selling of safe-haven U.S. Treasury debt,stocks trimmed gains later as technology shares plummeted onWall Street. The euro weakened further, hurt by persistent concerns overthe euro zone economy. The recovery in stocks markets was prompted by news ofseveral merger and acquisition deals, considered a sign thatcompanies are making use of high cash balances and historicallylow borrowing costs to look for bargains and expand theirbusiness. "The whole market is geared to M&A activity," said DavidBuik, senior partner at BCG Partners. "We're of the opinionthat the quality of economic data across the world is poor, buton the other side of the coin there is enough M&A activity outthere to limit any kind of a fall in the immediate future." Among the deals, Campbell Soup Co  may make a $2.3billion break-up bid for Britain's United Biscuits, owned byprivate equity firms PAI Partners and Blackstone Group LP , the London-based Sunday Times reported. For details,see [ID:nLDE67L05L]. HSBC is also in talks to buy a stake in South Africa'sNedbank in a potential $6.8 billion deal. In Asia, an estimated$58 billion worth of M&A was playing out Monday. Hewlett-Packard Co  offered $24 a share in cash fordata storage company 3PAR Inc. The $1.6 billion offertops a competing bid by technology rival Dell Inc  andfears of a bidding war weighed on HP's shares, dragging techstocks down. [ID:nN23188685]. The three main U.S. stock indexes rose nearly 1 percentafter the market opened but trimmed gains later, with theNasdaq turning negative. At around noon in New York, the Dow Jones industrialaverage  was up 6.32 points, or 0.06 percent, at10,219.94, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  gained1.27 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,072.96. The Nasdaq CompositeIndex  dropped 8.67 points, or 0.40 percent, to2,171.09. The MSCI All-Country World equity index rose 0.19 percent while the FTSEurofirst 300 index  oftop European shares closed up 0.67 percent, following threeconsecutive session of losses. Mining shares gained as financial markets bet Australia'sinconclusive weekend elections would lead to a change ofgovernment, spelling the end to a plan to impose tax on majoriron ore and coal mines. The STOXX Europe basic resources index  rose 2.96percent, while BHP Billiton , Anglo American ,Antofagasta  and Rio Tinto  gained 0.6 percentto 1.6 percent. U.S. crude oil prices  fell 75 cents, or 1.02percent, to $73.07 per barrel, as a stronger dollar made itmore expensive for investors using other currencies to buy thecommodity. EURO WEAKENS The dollar rose 0.1 percent against a basket of majorcurrencies measured by the U.S. Dollar Index . The euro continued its slide, down 0.15 percent to $1.2686,as it was hurt by concerns about the euro zone economy andprospects of loose monetary policy for an extended period. The number of investors betting against the euro hasincreased, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commissionshowed. [ID:nN20156189] Data from UBS AG also showed a drop in net investment flowsinto the euro zone for a third consecutive week. "August's deceleration in activity (in Europe) has dentedsome of the euro bulls' arguments about economic outperformancevis-a-vis the United States and as such put a cap on any eurorally for now," said Boris Schlossberg, director for currencyresearch at GFT in New York. The Australian dollar reversed losses after being dented bypolitical uncertainty from an inconclusive general election. The currency fell earlier after neither major party inAustralia won an overall majority in Saturday's election.[ID:nSGE67L021] The Aussie dollar traded as low as $0.8864  but itrecouped losses to trade at $0.8929, helped by buying fromreal-money accounts. U.S. Treasuries prices gave back part of a recent rally.The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was down 12/32 inprice, with the yield at 3.6829 percent, as investors tookprofits and made room for this week's $109 billion sale of bondauctions.
