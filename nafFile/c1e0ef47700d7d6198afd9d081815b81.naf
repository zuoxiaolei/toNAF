<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was steady against the yen on Monday, trading close to a one-week high, as expectations for further monetary easing measures by Japan continued to weigh on demand for the yen, while U.S. budget concerns supported safe haven demand.   USD/JPY hit 93.72 during European morning trade, the session high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 93.56, inching up 0.04%.   The pair was likely to find support at 92.44, the low of March 1 and resistance at 94.30, the high of February 25.   The yen remained under pressure after Japanâ€™s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe nominated last week Asian Development Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda, a proponent of aggressive monetary easing, to replace current Bank of Japan governor Masaaki Shirakawa.Meanwhile, the safe haven greenback found broad support after USD85 billion of automatic spending cuts, known as the "sequestration", began on Friday as lawmakers could not agree on spending cuts and tax reform to tackle the country's budget deficit.   U.S President Barack Obama said on Sunday he could compromise with Republican lawmakers by cutting welfare entitlements such as Medicare.   Markets were also jittery after China announced more property market tightening measures on Friday, in a bid to contain housing costs.   The yen was almost unchanged against the euro with EUR/JPY easing up 0.02%, to hit 121.80.   Also Monday, official data showed that the number of unemployed people in Spain rose far less-than-expected in February, increasing by 59,400 after a 132,100 rise the previous month.   Analysts had expected the number of unemployed people to rise by 77,500 last month.             ]]></raw>
