<raw><![CDATA[ PRAGUE, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The Czech Republic does not needto negotiate a formal opt-out from joining the euro currency,which would not be to the country's advantage for a long time,Prime Minister Petr Necas said on Sunday. The Czechs have been cautious about adopting the euro and Necas's centre-right cabinet has pushed the issue far into thefuture, saying it would not set any date during its term inoffice, which will end in 2014. Necas said during a televised debate the euro zone hadchanged since the Czech Republic made a commitment to eventuallyadopt the euro, due to the economic crisis and the EU's responseto it "At this point, it is clearly showing that the costs ofkeeping the crown are lower than those of adopting the euro,"Necas during a televised debate. "It will remain like that for avery long time." The Czech economy is highly dependent on exports, andcompanies that have seen their margins shrink due to thelong-term firming of the crown have been calling for adoption ofthe single currency. But Necas said keeping the crown would help in the processof alignment of the Czech economy with the euro zone and wouldkeep inflation low. Necas said eurosceptic Czech President Vaclav Klaus hadasked the government to consider negotiating an opt-out from thecountry's commitment to join the euro, which was mentioned in acentral bank document for the cabinet. But he said there was no need for that. "No one can force us into joining the euro... We have a defacto opt-out," he said. He said the country would decide when to join the ERM-2exchange rate mechanism, a precursor to euro membership that applicants must remain in for at least two years, and this gavethe government enough discretion on timing. He also said euro adoption was a "theoretical problem" giventhe fact that the country had to first narrow its budget gap andundergo reforms of its pension and healthcare systems before itcould apply.
