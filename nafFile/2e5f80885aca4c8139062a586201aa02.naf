<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The euro eased slightly against the U.S. dollar in Asian trade Thursday, as investors appeared uninspired by a meeting between French and German leaders to address Europe’s debt crisis.   EUR/USD hit 1.4518 in early Asian trade, the pair’s highest since July 27; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4425, falling 0.01%.   The pair was likely to find support at 1.4151, last Friday’s low, and resistance at 1.4518, the day’s high.   Earlier Wednesday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that its producer price inflation index rose by 0.2% in July, after a 0.4% decline the previous month. Market expectations were for a July increase of 0.1%.   The core PPI, which excludes food and energy costs, increased by 0.4% in July.   By the end of Wednesday’s U.S. trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.04%, to end at 11,410. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.47% to 2,511, and the S&P 500 eased up 0.09% to 1,194.   In Tuesday’s meeting between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel the two proposed the formation of a “euro council” to be led by current EU President Herman Van Rompuy.   But the two rejected an expansion to the USD633 billion rescue fund for debt-threatened countries in the euro-zone, calling instead for tighter regional budget rules and a resubmission of a financial transaction tax.   European shares ended their trading day mixed, with France’s CAC 40 closing up 0.73% to 3,254, while Britain’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.49% to 5,331, and Germany’s DAX lost 0.77% to 5,949.   Meanwhile, the euro was higher against the British pound but down against the Japanese yen, with EUR/GBP gaining 0.06% to hit 0.8727 and EUR/JPY down by 0.05% to hit 110.49.   Market eyes were expected to focus on U.S. labor data and consumer price index numbers due out Thursday.             ]]></raw>
