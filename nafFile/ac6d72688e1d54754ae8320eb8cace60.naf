<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar falls broadly, boosting oil, gold prices * China sees risks in holding "excessive" U.S. assets * U.S. stocks higher but investors remain cautious (Updates prices, adds details, comments) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell againstmajor currencies on Tuesday after a senior Chinese currencyregulator warned about the risks of excessive dollar holdings,while stocks rebounded as investors bought beaten-down shares. The weaker dollar helped Brent crude oil prices rise above$116 a barrel, though gains were limited by expectations thatOPEC will raise its production targets this week and by worriesthat an economic slowdown will erode demand. World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index rose 0.5 percent, snapping a four-sessiondecline. The Thomson Reuters global stock index gained 0.6 percent. Emerging market stocks  climbed0.4 percent. The dollar hit a record low against the Swiss franc and aone-month trough versus the euro after Guan Tao of the StateAdministration of Foreign Exchange said China must be alert tothe risk of holding too many dollars at a time when Washingtonis pursuing loose monetary and fiscal policies. For details,see [ID:nL3E7H71AA] "It's a sensitive topic for markets, and it does seem thatChina has had its fill of dollars," said BNY Mellon strategistMichael Woolfolk. The dollar fell as low as 0.8327 Swiss francs . Italso slid 0.6 percent against a basket of major currencies, to 73.514, its lowest in a month. The euro hit aone-month high of $1.4694 . U.S. stocks rose a day after the S&P 500 index hit itslowest in more than two months. Some investors are looking forfurther volatility and a possible move lower before equitiesstabilize. Citigroup's chief U.S. equity strategist said U.S. stockindexes could fall as much as 10 percent from their May highs,but barring unexpected shocks, should not return to a bearmarket. [ID:nN07126450] "I think we are in a correction," Citigroup's TobiasLevkovich said at the Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit inNew York. "We're just going to struggle along here, and therewill be bouts of rallies and pullbacks." A 10 percentcorrection from the May 2 peak of 1,370 would put the benchmarkS&P 500 index at 1,233. The Dow Jones industrial average  was up 51.01points, or 0.42 percent, at 12,140.97. The Standard & Poor's500 Index  was up 6.66 points, or 0.52 percent, at1,292.83. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 12.11points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,714.67. The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European sharessurrendered early gains to close down a fraction at 1,104.05,the lowest close since mid-March. It has lost 3.3 percent inthe five sessions so far in June. BERNANKE AHEAD Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke could provide clueson the U.S. central bank's view of the economic slowdown andthe timing of the Fed's exit from its extremely easy monetarypolicy at 3:45 p.m. EDT (1945 GMT) on Tuesday, when he isscheduled to speak. The dollar has been under pressure in recent months, hurtby worries about the U.S. economic recovery and expectationsthe Fed will keep benchmark interest rates near zero forlonger, even as other major central banks are tightening. The European Central Bank is expected on Thursday to signala second rise in rates this year, which could offset worriesabout a potential Greek debt restructuring. Brent crude rose as the weaker dollar and Middle Eastturmoil lifted prices, but news that Saudi Arabia planned toraise output in June regardless of the result of OPEC'sWednesday meeting helped limit Brent's gains and put pressureon U.S. crude futures. Brent crude oil  was up $2.64 at $117.12 a barrel.U.S. crude  rose 45 cents to $99.46 a barrel. Spot gold  earlier rose as high as $1,550 an ounce.It later pulled back to trade at $1,544.80 as investors tookprofits on the metal's 5 percent rally in the past three weeks. U.S. Treasury debt prices remained lower after a solidauction of $32 billion of three-year notes. Benchmark 10-yearTreasury notes  were yielding 3.01 percent, up from3.00 percent late on Monday.
