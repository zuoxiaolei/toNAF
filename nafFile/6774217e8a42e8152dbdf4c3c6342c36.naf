<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The pound remained lower against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, as concerns over the outlook for economic growth in the U.K. and uncertainty over Britain’s future in the European Union continued to dampen demand for sterling.   GBP/USD hit 1.5757 during U.S. morning trade, the pair's lowest since August 28; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.5773, shedding 0.45%.   Cable was likely to find support at 1.5707, the low of August 21 and resistance at 1.5852, the session high.   The pound was trading close to five-month lows against the greenback after the International Monetary Fund cut Britain's growth forecast for this year and the next on Wednesday, adding to fears over the faltering U.K. recovery.The IMF said that Britain’s economy would grow by 1% this year, 0.1% lower than in its October forecast and by 1.9% in 2014 , 0.3% less compared with October.The IMF also trimmed its 2013 forecast for global growth to 3.5% from the 3.6% it projected in October, but said the global economy would expand by 4.1% in 2014 if the euro zone recovery continued.Meanwhile, uncertainty over Britain’s future in the EU lingered after Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to hold a referendum on the issue before the end of 2017, amid growing political pressure for Britain to re-negotiate its relationship with Europe.   In the U.S., the Department of Labor earlier said that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending January 19 fell by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 330,000, the lowest level since January 2008, compared to expectations for an increase of 20,000 to 355,000.Jobless claims for the preceding week stood at 335,000 people.   Sterling was also lower against the euro with EUR/GBP advancing 0.80%, to hit 0.8471.   Also Thursday, data from the euro zone showed that manufacturing activity in Germany and the wider euro zone improved in January, but indicated that France, the bloc’s second largest economy may be in a recession.             ]]></raw>
