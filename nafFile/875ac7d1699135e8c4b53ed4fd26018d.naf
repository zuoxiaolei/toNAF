<raw><![CDATA[ * Expects debt-GDP ratio to rise over coming years * Bond market depth, light interest burden offsets risk By Umesh Desai HONG KONG, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Japan's fiscal burden isexpected to increase over fhe coming years but risks to itscredit ratings are being offset by a strong external balancesheet, Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday. Japan's government last month approved a record budget forthe fiscal year starting April that will inflate the country'sdebt by $484 billion, and concerns about increased supplieshave hurt long dated bonds and steepened the yield curve. "With the world's highest debt-to-GDP ratio which continuesto increase, there are fiscal issues which weigh on Japan'sratings," James McCormack, head of Asia sovereign ratings atFitch, told Reuters an interview. "But it is not absolutely urgent (to address these issues).There is no funding or financing crisis." McCormack said the government's plan to issue 44.3 trillionyen ($480.1 billion) in new debt in fiscal 2010/11 starting inApril was within the agency's forecast of around 49 trillionyen. In November, Fitch warned it would review its AA-minusrating on JGBs if there was a material increase in issuanceabove 44 trillion yen. Fitch rates Japan's long-term foreign and local currencyissuer default ratings at AA and AA-minus, respectively. Theoutlook on both ratings is stable. JGB issuance to the market through regular auctions,including both new JGBs and refunding bonds, will hit a record144.3 trillion yen in fiscal 2010/11, up 4.9 percent from thisyear's record high. McCormack said the debt-to-GDP ratio will continue to rise,having already exceeded 200 percent, but reiterated any risk ofa downgrade was being offset by the country's strong externalposition. "Japan is not yet on the road to fiscal consolidation. Westill see the debt-GDP ratio going up for the next couple ofyears and we don't see a meaningful fiscal consolidationprogramme," he said. "The strengths of Japan are quite profound from a ratingperspective. It is the world's largest net external creditor --at end of 2009 it was about $2.5 trillion." He also said Japan benefitted from the depth of itsdomestic debt market, which was a stable and a liquid source offinancing its deficit, as well as high domestic savings and lowinterest rates. The interest-revenue ratio of 10 percent comparedfavourably with AAA-rated U.S.A. and Canada and lower thanItaly's, which has a AA-minus rating, but the rating weaknessesremained with no medium term fiscal consolidation strategy,McCormack said.
