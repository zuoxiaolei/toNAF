The data came along with a sharp upward revision of March'sreading and on the heels of April manufacturing output matchingits fastest pace in 15 years, indicating strong growth andrising inflationary pressures in Asia's third-largest economy. Separately, the finance ministry's chief economic adviser,Kaushik Basu, said the strong growth in manufacturing wouldcontinue and forecast the economy to grow 8.9 percent in theJune quarter, topping the previous quarter's 8.6 percentexpansion.   "This (inflation) increases the likelihood of aninter-meeting rate hike from the RBI as inflationary pressuresare really showing up," said Sebastien Barbe, Hong Kong-basedhead of emerging markets research and strategy at CreditAgricole. "It seems like the markets are also now less worried aboutthe situation in Europe, so the RBI may be less reluctant totighten before July."   Bond yields and overnight swaps rose on the data, whilestocks trimmed gains. Most analysts had earlier said the RBIwould wait until its July 27 review to raise interest rates,seeing its hands stayed by Europe's woes and and on liquiditytightness. [ID:nBMA007807] That view is now changing. "RBI will increase the frequency of its baby steps and weexpect some tightening measures in June itself and a repetitionof those in the July policy," said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chiefeconomist at Bank of Baroda in Mumbai. "Baby steps" to normalise monetary policy is what the RBIhas said is its preferred choice of action, but it has also keptopen the option of a rate hike ahead of the July review tocombat inflation which it deems "worrisome." K.C. Chakraborty, a central bank deputy governor, said therewas a "fifty-fifty" chance of a hike before the review, whileFinance Minister Pranab Mukherjee indicated he did not favour anear-term hike and said price pressures would ease in mid-July. "There will be inflationary pressures till middle of Julybut at this point of time I am not thinking of altering interestrates," Mukherjee told reporters in the city of Patna on Monday. The wholesale price index (WPI) rose an annual 10.16 percentin May, higher than the median forecast for 9.56 percent in aReuters' poll and April's 9.59 percent. In a sign the May reading could be an underestimate, Marchinflation was revised to 11.04 percent from the earlier estimateof 9.90 percent. Recent WPI data have been similarly revised up. India's economy grew at 7.4 percent in the year to end-March2010 and is seen expanding at 8.5 percent in the current fiscalyear that began on April 1. REFORMS MORE DIFFICULT Persistently high inflation, which has been over the centralbank's perceived comfort level of 5 percent for seven monthsrunning, could turn voters against the ruling Congress partybefore eight state elections scheduled in 2010 and 2011. It would also dampen enthusiasm for reforms, such as akeenly awaited freeing up of retail fuel prices, crucial toimproving public finances and stop state-run fuel retailers frombleeding. The government deferred last week taking a decision onfreeing fuel prices, worried about political opposition and theimpact on prices. For a Q+A on the impact of a delay in fuel price reforms,see [ID:nSGE65D04O] Policymakers have repeatedly said inflation would ease onbetter prospects for crops from good monsoon rains. But a hikein fuel prices could push it up, an adviser hassaid.[ID:nBMA007779] On Monday, Basu said the impact would be limited. "The inflation figure you are getting is going to go up," hesaid. "But if you go six months down the road ... in my opinionyou would see a smaller inflation then." The benchmark 10-year bond yield , which hadrisen 6 basis points after the WPI data, ticked up another pointto go past a five-week high of 7.68 percent. "The hawkish comments by Basu led to a further sell off inan already nervous market," said Bekxy Kuriakose, head of fixedincome at L&T Investment Management. One-year indexed swap rates  rose 6 basispoints. The swap rate has risen over 50 basis points from amore-than 5-month low of 4.71 percent in early May on concernsover tight liquidity and expectations of higher policy rates. Basu and Finance Secretary Ashok Chawla said the high WPIreadings were a matter of concern, but inflation would soften inthe months to come on cooling food prices. Chawla forecast WPI to fall to 5-6 percent by December, withBasu adding it would be below 5 percent by end-March 2011.
