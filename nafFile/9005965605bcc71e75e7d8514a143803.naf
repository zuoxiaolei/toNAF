<raw><![CDATA[ * Silver has more upside potential this year * A return to high $40's likely  By Amanda Cooper LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - Platinum is drawing investment asa financial asset and palladium boasts an enviable marketbalance but silver could top the precious pack this year as itslatest fall offers a chance to buy, GFMS's Philip Klapwijk said. The managing director of the metals consultancy, which onThursday released its 2010 Platinum and Palladium market survey,said that once the current price decline from last week's recordabove $49 an ounce has petered out, silver has enough favouramong investors to return to these levels. "If we see silver drop, perhaps down close to $30-mark then,(it) would look a pretty decent buy, because through to the endof the year, you've got the possibility of 40 to 50-percentprice gains," Klapwijk said in an interview with Reuters. "I'm not sure that silver would get above $50 but would wesee it in the upper $40's again? Quite possibly. I don't seethat scale of increase probably out there for gold and forplatinum and probably not for palladium either," he said. The silver price, which is still up about 22 percent so farthis year at $38 an ounce, is set for its largest weekly declinein nearly 30 years, led by selling after a series of sharp risesin margin requirements to hold U.S. silver futures, as well ashefty outflows of metal from the world's largest exchange-tradedfunds.  COMPLEX TRAILS Gold, which hit a record $1,575.79 an ounce on Monday, is uponly 6.5 percent this year, while platinum has risen by 1.7percent to around $1,885 an ounce. Palladium, which virtually doubled in price last year, haslost nearly 8 percent to trade around $728.25, its lowest innearly two months. GFMS expects platinum to show a seventh consecutive annualsurplus in 2011 as jewellery demand softens and consumption fromthe auto sector continues to depend on the struggling Europeanmarket, which is predominantly diesel-powered. Palladium on the other hand is forecast to show a deficit,possibly of over half a million ounces in 2011, for a fifth yearin a row, while demand is expected to show modest improvement,largely thanks to robust use of the metal in catalyticconverters for the gasoline-intensive Chinese and U.S. markets. "The motivation for investment in platinum ... has shiftedfrom an assessment of the commodity fundamentals and a decisionwhether these support higher prices or not, to broaderconsiderations that take into account financial and economicfactors and which are encouraging investment demand for thepurposes of portfolio diversification as a hedge against thedollar and financial risk," Klapwijk said.
