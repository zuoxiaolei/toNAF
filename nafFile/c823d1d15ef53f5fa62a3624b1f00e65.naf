<raw><![CDATA[ * U.S. dollar retreats after biggest rally in 3 weeks * BoE minutes seen as relatively dovish; sterling hit * U.S. CPI up 0.3 percent, but core inflation tame (Updates prices to midday, adds background on Fed and commentfrom St. Louis Fed's Bullard) By Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against theeuro on Wednesday as dealers took profits on the currency'sbiggest rise in three weeks, with fresh data doing little toalter the view that U.S. interest rates will remain at recordlows well into 2010. Reports showing slightly higher-than-expected U.S.inflation and a slide in new home construction helped keepeuro gains below $1.50. But most dealers say the dollar's longer-term decliningtrend is intact. They noted that although the Federal Reservemay be in the early stages of withdrawing its huge stimulusmeasures, it is still nowhere near raising interest rates fromrecord lows. On Tuesday, the Fed said it would pare back a discountwindow borrowing facility. And St. Louis Fed President JamesBullard said on Wednesday that officials will probably adjustasset-purchase programs before they resort to hiking interestrates. "That throws cold water on any lingering thoughts of ratehikes," said Jacob Oubina, strategist at Forex.com inBedminster, New Jersey. This also offsets comments this weekfrom Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who triggered a dollar rallywhen he said the central bank was attentive to the dollar'svalue. The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.4973 while against theyen, the dollar edged up  0.1 percent to 89.35 yen. Bernanke's rare dollar comments, which were echoed byother Fed officials and European Central Bank PresidentJean-Claude Trichet, had pushed the euro down toward $1.48 onTuesday. Earlier reports showing a slight gain in the overall U.S.Consumer Price Index and a slide in housing starts undercutsome foreign currency gains against the dollar on the viewthat a sluggish U.S. economy could undermine global recovery. But that wasn't enough to change the Fed's outlook. "We're not worried so much about inflation," said AmeliaBourdeau, senior strategist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut."Overall, it's still benign because the year-over-year figurewas still negative." Sterling slipped 0.4 percent to $1.6755 while the euro wasup 1 percent at 89.38 pence. The minutes of the Bank of England's Nov. 4-5 meetingshowed a three-way split, with seven of its nine membersvoting to expand the bank's quantitative easing program by 25billion pounds to 200 billion pounds. Perhaps the biggest surprise was discussion on potentiallycutting the rate of remuneration the BoE pays on bankreserves. This could ease policy by encouraging banks to lendmore. "Any hope for an MPC-related boost to sterling is gone,"said Daragh Maher, deputy head of FX strategy at Calyon inLondon, referring to the Bank of England's Monetary PolicyCommittee. U.S. President Barack Obama wrapped up a visit to China onWednesday, although few traders expect any near-term changesin Beijing's foreign-exchange policy.
