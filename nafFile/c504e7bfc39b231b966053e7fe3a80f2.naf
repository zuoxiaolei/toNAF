<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded modestly higher against the Japanese yen during Friday’s Asian session following the release of Japanese consumer price inflation data. In Asian trading Friday, USD/JPY inched up 0.01% to 99.30. The pair was likely to find support at 99.13, Tuesday’s low and resistance at 100.61, Monday’s high. Earlier Friday, data showed Japanese consumer prices excluding fresh food rose 0.4% last month, the biggest increase in four and a half years and a sign that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to thwart deflation are working. Economists expected Japan’s CPI to rise 0.3%. Traders appeared to focus more on the fact that excluding energy, prices fell 0.2%, extending four years of declines. Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, has been saddled with deflation for multiple decades and putting an end to that inflation is a key component of Abe’s efforts to reinvigorate the country’s economy. Any sign deflationary pressures are easing could also be taken as a sign that Abenomics is working. Citigroup said it sees CPI increases of 0.5% in July and August for Japan with the number falling back a bit in September. If prices continue to rise, Abe will need the so-called third arrow of his economic agenda, higher personal incomes, to kick in because with the yen already weak, soaring consumer prices will further erode purchasing power. About 40% of Japanese said their life is tough economically, according to a survey of 21,173 households by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research released on July 24, Bloomberg reported. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY fell 0.05% to 131.76 while AUD/JPY rose 0.10% to 91.87.             ]]></raw>
