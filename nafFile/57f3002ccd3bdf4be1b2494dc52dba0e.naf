The retreat in stocks and other riskier assets fed a rallyin theoretically safer euro zone and U.S. government bondprices, with comments from a Federal Reserve official thatadding to fears about the economy. The second quarter GDP data, due at 1230 GMT, will beparticularly closely watched after a stream of economic data inthe past month flagged a slowdown in the U.S. economy's recoveryfrom the worst downturn since the 1930s. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For a graphic on prospects of a double-dip recession, click http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/10/GLB_CYC.html^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The dollar was down 0.6 percent at 86.38 yen by 1053 GMT,after hitting an eight-month low of 86.15 yen on tradingplatform EBS. Stop-loss trades below the previous low of 86.25yen were triggered before support emerged from bids in the 86.20yen area. "U.S. economic data is underperforming and keeping pressureon the dollar," said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank ofTokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. "Concerns about the U.S. economy and Fed easing will alsoput U.S. yields, which are a key driver for dollar/yen, on thedownside," he said. Two-year U.S. Treasury note yields, which move inversely toprices, hovered near record lows of around 0.556 percent setearlier this month ahead of the GDP data. Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields were about threebasis points lower at 2.961 percent. The yields hit a 15-monthlow of 2.855 percent earlier this month on persistent fears theeconomy was tipping back into recession. The dollar also fell to a six-month low against the Swissfranc of 1.0364 francs. The euro, meanwhile, fell 0.6 percent to $1.3000, pullingback from a 12-week peak of $1.3107 hit on Thursday, when datashowed a jump in euro zone economic sentiment and lower Germanunemployment. "The grind higher in euro/dollar may continue but it seemsthere is still plenty of selling interest out there in themarket," said Daragh Maher, deputy head of FX strategy at CreditAgricole CIB. "Some softer U.S. data would clearly help thebullish euro case."  JAPAN STYLE QUAGMIRE? Economists forecast U.S. growth to have slowed to 2.5percent in the three months to June from 2.7 percent in thefirst quarter. But worries persist it could come in weaker. St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, avoting member on the Fed's rate-setting committee this year, said he was worried about the risks the United States might fallinto a Japan-style quagmire of falling prices and investment. World stocks as measured by MSCI were 0.4 percent down asEuropean shares retreated for a third consecutive session. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index shed 0.3 percent butwas still on track to record its best monthly gain since March,helped by upbeat corporate earnings. "What I see in this market is a fight between macro-economicdata and better-than-expected company results," said Koen DeLeus, economist at KBC Securities. "It appears the U.S. FederalReserve is preparing the markets for worst-than-expected data." Japan's Nikkei closed down 1.6 percent as signs that theU.S. recovery was faltering outweighed upbeat domestic earnings. Sluggish jobs growth, marked by a 9.5 percent unemploymentrate, is the biggest obstacle to the U.S. economy's recoveryfrom the most brutal recession since the 1930s. In Britain, consumer confidence fell for the fifth month ina row in July to its lowest in almost a year, further coolingdeemed for riskier assets. "This type of news flow will continue to depressexpectations over the pace of economic recovery," said GerardLane, analyst at Shore Capital.  U.S. crude prices retreated, heading for a fourthconsecutive weekly settlement within the $75-$80 range, withinvestor focus on a slowing economy and rising U.S. inventories.(Additional reporting by Tamawa Desai and Atul Prakash;Editing by Ron Askew)             ]]></raw>
