<raw><![CDATA[ * Bank stress test result due on July 23 - Lagarde * Number of banks involved to be announced soon * Dexia received criteria last week  (Adds Dexia comments) AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France, July 4 (Reuters) - The result oftests designed to show that Europe's banks are able to cope withfurther economic and other shocks will be published on July 23,French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Sunday. Europe's banking watchdogs have been running the stresstests to boost confidence in the sector as it emerges from thefinancial crisis to face mounting pressure from tighter capitalrequirements, extra taxes and additional regulation. "You will soon be seeing the number of banks that will besubmitted to the stress test, you will have better understandingof the exact criteria we apply and of how heavily we stress thesystem, and then later on July 23rd, the result of the stresstest will be issued," Lagarde told reporters on the sidelines ofa conference. "And you will see that banks in Europe are solid andhealthy," she added. Asked about French banks, she said: "I'mnot worried about my banks." Simulated tests carried out by analysts showed KBC, NationalBank of Greece, Commerzbank, Credit Agricole and Dexia faredmore poorly than big rivals, but without falling to dangerlevels. Dexia chief executive Pierre Mariani said the bank receiveddetails about the tests recently. "The criteria upon which the stress tests are to be basedwere communicated to us at the end of the week," Mariani toldReuters. "We are examining them." Mariani declined to comment on the details of the criteria,nor would he say how Dexia might fare. Banking regulators have already been testing the resilienceof 25 big EU lenders to an economic downturn and rising loanlosses. Sources have told Reuters that the tests will beexpanded to more than 100 across the region, with the tests alsocovering risks from banks' sovereign debt holdings. While some analysts have said the stress tests shouldrestore confidence in the sector and lead to a recapitalisationof weaker banks, others have said the exact criteria of thesovereign stress needs to be disclosed if the tests are toconvince the market.
