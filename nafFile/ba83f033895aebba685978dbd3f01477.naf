<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was broadly lower against its major counterparts on Thursday, as markets awaited testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke later in the day, while a well received Spanish bond auction and a surprise rate cut by China bolstered risk appetite.During European afternoon trade, the euro edged higher against the U.S. dollar, with EUR/USD rising 0.14% to hit 1.2599.Market sentiment found support after the People's Bank of China said it will lower benchmark interest rates by 0.25%, effective Friday, in a bid to bolster growth in the world’s second largest economy and alleviate the effects of the global economic slowdown.The euro pulled back from the session low against the greenback earlier after Spain successfully sold EUR2.07 billion of bonds, slightly more than the targeted amount, in an auction which met with solid investor demand, but saw borrowing costs rise.Meanwhile, investors were looking ahead to Fed Chair Ben Bernanke’s testimony on the U.S. economic outlook before a congressional committee in Washington later in the day, amid speculation that the U.S. central bank is mulling new measures to stimulate growth.The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD climbing 0.54% to hit 1.5577.The pound strengthened broadly earlier after the Bank of England left U.K. interest rates unchanged at 0.5%, and maintained its quantitative easing program at GBP325 billion.The announcement came after data showing that the U.K. service sector grew faster than expected in May, matching the strong rate of growth seen the previous month.Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against the yen, with USD/JPY advancing 0.64% to hit 79.68, but slipped lower against the Swiss franc, USD/CHF losing 0.15% to hit 0.9528.The greenback was down against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD shedding 0.36% to hit 1.0239, AUD/USD up 0.54% to hit 0.9980 and NZD/USD gaining 0.32% to hit 0.7730.The Australian dollar strengthened earlier after official data showed the country’s economy added 38,900 jobs in May, beating expectations for a 2,200 decline and following a 7,000 rise the previous month.Australia’s unemployment rate ticked up to 5.1% from April’s 5.0% reading, in line with expectations.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.21%, to trade at 82.09.Also Thursday, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week fell by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 377,000, in line with expectations.The previous week’s figure was revised up to 389,000 from a previously reported 383,000.             ]]></raw>
