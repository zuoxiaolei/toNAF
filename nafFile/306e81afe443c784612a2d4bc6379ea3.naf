<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar took back earlier losses against the euro on Monday after investors digested disappointing U.S. durable goods numbers and snapped up nicely priced greenback positions afterwards to await fresh cues from the Federal Reserve on the fate of monetary stimulus measures.In U.S. trading on Monday, EUR/USD was down 0.03% at 1.3374, up from a session low of 1.3357 and off from a high of 1.3394.The pair was likely to find support at 1.3298, Thursday's low, and resistance at 1.3452, Tuesday's high.The Commerce Department reported earlier that U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.3% in July, outpacing expectations for a 4.0% decline. The July figure marked the largest decline since August 2012.Core durable goods orders, which are stripped of volatile transportation items, fell 0.6% last month, defying expectations for a 0.5% increase.The numbers weakened the dollar earlier by keeping sentiments alive that the Federal Reserve won't rush to taper its USD85 billion in monthly bond purchases, which weaken the dollar to spur recovery.On Friday, the Commerce Department reported that new home sales in the U.S. dropped 13.4% to 394,000 units in July, far worse than market expectations for a 1.4% decline. The dollar, however, regained strength as many market participants concluded that the Federal Reserve remains on track to begin tapering the pace of its asset purchases this year, and doubts surrounding a September start date or a December start date have been priced into trading.The euro, meanwhile, was down against the pound and down against the yen, with EUR/GBP trading down 0.09% at 0.8586 and EUR/JPY trading down 0.14% at 131.90.On Tuesday, the Ifo institute is to release its German business climate report, while the U.S. is to publish private-sector data on house price inflation as well as a closely watched report on consumer confidence.             ]]></raw>
