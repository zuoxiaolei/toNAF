<raw><![CDATA[ * World stocks slip, focus on U.S. economy * Wall Street set for losses * Yen weaker after new finance minister's comments  By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Equities came off the boilglobally on Thursday, after rising every day so far this year,as investors stepped back to await key U.S. economic data at theend of the week. The dollar firmed, partly due to the yen softening after newJapanese Finance Minister Naoto Kan said he wanted it to weakenmore. Wall Street looked set to open lower. Investors have entered 2010 in bullish form, taking stocksto new 15-month highs in the United States, Japan and Europe.But the mood is contingent on firm evidence that global economyis recovering, particularly in the United States. U.S. jobs data due on Friday is seen as key. James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal ReserveBank, told an audience of university students in Shanghai thatthe labour market in the United States was improving and theeconomy was close to the point when the unemployment rate willstart to fall. Stock investors, however, were playing it safe. MSCI'sall-country benchmark  was down 0.4 percent aftergaining as much as 2.5 percent this week. "It's a fine line between weak (U.S. job) numbers that wouldrevive doubts over the pace of the recovery, and surprisinglystrong numbers, which would raise fears of early interest ratehikes," said Valerie Plagnol, chief strategist at CM-CICSecurities, in Paris. "But overall, the market has recently made spectaculargains, so we shouldn't be reading too much into today's dip.Some people are just taking profits." Europe's FTSEurofirst 300  was down 0.4 percent.Japan's Nikkei average  closed down 0.46 percent. Earlier, China's key stock index fell 1.9 percent after thecountry's central bank surprised the market by raising theauction yield of its three-month bills, a move seen as asignificant step-up in liquidity tightening. Investors are also concerned about a number of structuralproblems, not the least the state of some euro zone countries'finances. European officials were on the second day of an inspectionvisit to Athens to discuss Greece's stability programme. Greecehas seen its debt downgraded but insists it does not need to bebailed out by its EU partners.  WEAKER YEN? The yen fell against the dollar and other currencies afterJapan's new finance minister stirred talk the country may bemore inclined to stem any sharp rise in the yen. Speaking after being appointed finance minister, Kan saidmany Japanese firms were in favour of the dollar/yen around 95yen, higher than the pair has been trading in the latter part of2009. [ID:nTOE60607E] The dollar was up more than three-quarters of a percent at93.08 yen . "His comments may mark a shift of Japanese FX policy towardsweakening the JPY, in our view," Barclays Capital said in anote. "Such a stance seems to be appropriate for Japan,considering the weak growth prospects, particularly in the firsthalf of 2010, which will see less economic stimulus measuresand, therefore, a strong need for exports to push up the wholeeconomy." Against a basket of major currencies , the dollargained a half a percent. The euro was down 0.6 percent at$1.4325 . Euro zone government bond yields were generally lower inlight of the stocks decline.
