<raw><![CDATA[ * Stocks seen rising 15-20 pct in 2010 on recovery, copper * A Pinera presidency would provide a near-term boost * Peso could appreciate to as high as 465 per dollar By Aaron Nelsen and Maria Jose Latorre SANTIAGO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The rally in Chile's bourse isseen forging ahead in 2010 as the economy recovers and copperprices rebound, and would get an extra boost if theconservative market pick wins the presidency on Sunday. Chile's peso is also expected to continue its rapidappreciation as costly commodities bring more U.S. dollars inrevenues into the world's No.1 copper producer. The leading index IPSA  ended 2009 at an all-timehigh, gaining 51 percent in its biggest annual rise in 16 yearsas Chile emerges from its first recession in a decade. Howeverit lagged the 83 percent gain on Brazil's Bovespa . An upswing in commodity prices like oil and copper andstimulus measures are helping many emerging countries recoverfrom the crisis and has provided a boost to their bourses.[ID:nN15193308] Chilean stocks have since continued to rally, and are up5.6 percent so far this year alone, though any renewed bout ofglobal crisis hitting demand in major copper consumer China,and any consequent fall in copper prices, would underminegains. Investors see retail and commodity shares leading thebourse this year. "We're optimistic about 2010," said Ronald Espinosa, headof investments at the Inversiones Security brokerage. We're notexpecting to see a repeat of 2009, but we think it's going tobe a good year for the bourse, with an expected return ofaround 20 percent." A presidential win by the market favorite, billionaireSebastian Pinera, in a Sunday run-off election that is expectedto be very tight would add to momentum in the near-term.[ID:nN14113271] "The bourse will probably react in the very short term ifPinera wins," said Claudio Gonzalez, head of research andstrategy at the Tanner brokerage in Santiago. "But it would beshort-lived." Pinera is seen winning Sunday's vote by a razor-thin marginagainst former president Eduardo Frei, who is running for thecenter-left coalition that has ruled Chile since the end ofGen. Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship in 1990. A MORI poll published this week showed Pinera with a 1.8percentage point lead over Frei, within the margin of error. Pinera is banking on the private sector to invest heavily,create jobs and so boost economic growth, while Frei wants astronger state role in the economy. [ID:nN11163285] Pinera's critics say his plan relies too much on thestrength of the global recovery. However few expect any major changes to policies that havecemented Chile's position as one of the region's most stableeconomies, whomever wins. [ID:nN14192252] [ID:nN14131531] Key mining and retail projects are being revived as thecrisis abates and Chile's $170 billion economy is expected tobounce back from recession in 2009 to show growth of up to 5.5percent this year, the central bank estimates. TOO FAST, TOO SOON? Still, some analysts warn the IPSA's rapid surge so earlyin the year could limit gains for the rest of 2010. The markethas risen more than 18 percent since Nov. 26 alone, and theprice to earnings (PE) ratio of the IPSA stands at around 19. Commodity and retail shares are leading the rally, withindustrial conglomerate Copec  already up around 7.5percent year-to-date and top lithium producer Soquimich surging nearly 10 percent. "For the first half of 2010 the outlook is good becauseChile looks to benefit from the outlook for commodities," saidSalvador Arenas, head of research for LarrainVial. "The roadcould get more difficult in the second half of the year becausestocks will have incorporated a good part of gains for 2010." Forestry giants Copec and CMPC , Soquimich, andretail department store owners Cencosud  and Falabella are seen leading the year's gains. Chile's peso  is trading at 19-month highs and rose26 percent in 2009 on closing out of carry trades and strongcopper prices. The central bank had warned in recent months it couldintervene to disrupt a sharp appreciation of the peso. However,in an apparent shift bank President Jose De Gregorio last weekwarned any attempt to fix the currency was "extremelydangerous", which could leave room for further appreciation. The currency has climbed 3.7 percent so far in January toaround 489 per dollar and analysts say it will likelyappreciate to between 490 to 465 per dollar in 2010. "Copper, our main export, remains at near record highs andthat gives you an enormous surplus of dollars," said PatricioRoncagliolo, head of finance for FXCM Chile, who seesresistance at around 465 pesos.
