<raw><![CDATA[   Investing.com – The euro was down against the yen on Monday, falling to a fresh daily low, as a monetary stimulus measure introduced by the Bank of Japan did little to weaken the strengthening yen from near its highest level in 15 years.EUR/JPY hit 107.79 during European morning trade, the pair’s daily low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 107.81, tumbling 1.05%.The pair was likely to find support at 105.42, the low of August 24 and a 9-year low, and resistance at 109.61, the high of August 20.Earlier in the day, the Bank of Japan announced that it planned to extend a bank lending program it introduced in December, adding that it would increase funds in the program by 10 trillion yen to a total of 30 trillion yen.The extra 10 trillion yen unveiled today will be offered in six-month credit, with the term for the other 20 trillion yen remaining at three months.Bank of Japan Governor, Masaaki Shirakawa said that he believed the “monetary-easing measure, together with government efforts, will be effective in further ensuring Japan's economic recovery,", while adding that he needed “to pay more attention to downside risks stemming from unstable foreign exchange”.The yen was also up against the U.S. dollar, with USD/JPY shedding 0.67% to hit 84.78.Earlier in the day, the Bank of Japan announced that it kept its benchmark overnight lending rate at 0.1%.             ]]></raw>
