<raw><![CDATA[ * China-bound exports post 1st annual rise in 14 months * Chinese demand lifts exports of chemicals, auto parts * Economists say return to recession unlikely due to exports * Japan's domestic demand still a worry for the economy (Adds real export index, extra graphic) By Rie Ishiguro TOKYO, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Japan's exports rose by the most inseven years in November on signs of a pickup in demand fromChina, calming worries that the economy will slip back intorecession next year. Shipments to China rose from a year earlier for the firsttime since global trade collapsed late last year and economistssaid demand from China and the rest of Asia will continue tosupport exports and offset weak domestic demand. That is welcome news for a government scrambling to avert therisk of another slump in the economy even as many other countriesare preparing for recovery and the unwinding of emergencymeasures put in place during the height of the crisis. "I'd say the recovery in exports so far this year has beenclose to the best scenario we had thought of at the beginning ofthe year," said Junko Nishioka, chief economist at RBS Securitiesin Tokyo. "Given that exports are growing solidly despite the yen'srise last month, we don't need to be overly pessimistic aboutgrowth. The economy will perhaps slow down early next year but arecession is unlikely." Exports rose a seasonally adjusted 4.9 percent in Novemberfrom the previous month, increasing for the fourth straight monthand setting the strongest pace since November 2002. The real exports index, compiled by the Bank of Japan, edgedup 0.6 percent, rising for the eighth straight month. November exports fell 6.2 percent from a year earlier,slightly less than expected and the smallest fall since theglobal crisis blew up late last year. October exports had fallen23.2 percent from a year earlier. Exports to China in November rose 7.8 percent from a yearearlier, up for the first time in 14 months, with sales of suchproducts as chemical compounds, auto parts and resinscontributing to growth. Exports to China have jumped in a number of countries, thoughanalysts partly attribute this to the comparison with a weak setof figures for November 2008, when world trade was slumping. Thaicustoms data released on Monday showed November exports to Chinajumped 77 percent, and Korea reported earlier this month a 55percent rise. As a result, exports to Asia, which account for more thanhalf of Japan's total exports, rose 4.7 percent from a yearearlier, also the first annual rise since September last year. "Strong domestic demand in Asia, rather than demand createdby government stimulus, is making a bigger contribution to therecovery in Japan's exports than before," said Seiji Shiraishi,chief economist at HSBC Securities Japan. "Still, we need to be cautious about the outlook for exportsbecause not all Asia-bound exports are consumed locally but someof them are shipped elsewhere. So a slowdown is likely early nextyear when global stimulus runs its course," he said. Demand from developed economies was still falling,underlining the different pace of recovery in the world economy. Exports to the United States fell 7.9 percent, much smallerthan a fall of 27.6 percent in the previous month. But autoexports rose for the first time since April 2008. Japan's November trade surplus was 373.9 billion yen ($4.13billion), bigger than a median forecast of 344.5 billion yen. The rebound in exports has been a major driving force behindJapan's recovery from its worst recession in decades. Although few economists expect another recession, they sayJapan's economy will likely grow very slowly in the first half ofnext year. "We still expect the economy to show a temporary dip in thesecond quarter of next year because of feeble domesticconsumption and slumping corporate capital spending," saidAtsushi Matsumoto, economist at Mizuho Research Institute. Headline growth in Japan exports may also slip as Japanesecompanies shift production to China to take advantage of stronglocal consumption, he added. Earlier this month the government of Prime Minister YukioHatoyama, in office for three months, unveiled an additionalstimulus package worth $81 billion aimed at averting a downturnahead of upper house elections next year. It has also pressured the Bank of Japan to take action tosupport the economy further. This month the BOJ held an emergencymeeting and offered a new funding operation and just last week ittoughened its definition of deflation, setting the scene for newmeasures.
