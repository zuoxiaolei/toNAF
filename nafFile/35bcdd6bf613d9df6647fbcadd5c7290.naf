<raw><![CDATA[ * BOJ emergency meeting highly unlikely on Thurs -sources * BOJ has started considering additional easing steps - media * Report lends support to dollar/yen * Japan investors buying more foreign debt * Euro/dollar slips after Spiegel report on Greece * Support for euro seen at 100-day MA around $1.2776 By Kaori Kaneko TOKYO, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The dollar pared gains against theyen on Thursday after sources familiar with the matter said theBank of Japan is highly unlikely to hold an emergency meetinglater in the day. Rumours had circulated in the market that the BOJ would holdan emergency policy meeting at 2 p.m. local time (0500 GMT) aftera media report that the central bank had started consideringadditional monetary easing steps. The most likely option under consideration is expanding theBOJ's fund-supply tool put in place in December, Japan's Sankeinewspaper said, without citing sources. The central bank may either expand the fund supply volume to30 trillion yen ($352 billion) from 20 trillion yen, or extendthe duration of cheap, fixed-rate loans to banks to six monthsfrom three months, the paper said. The report weighed on the yen somewhat but the overallreaction was limited as investors remained cautious until theysee exactly what the authorities might do. "If the BOJ announces only what the report is saying, it islikely to disappoint the market. And there is a possibility thatthe yen may even appreciate further," said Yuji Saito, directorat Credit Agricole's foreign exchange department. The dollar rose 0.2 percent compared with late U.S. trade onWednesday to 85.65 yen, trimming gains from day's high at 85.81yen but holding above a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on tradingplatform EBS last week. "Such steps by the BOJ may help to spur dollar short-coveringagainst the yen. But it would be difficult to change the yen'sfirm trend," said Tomohiro Nishida, treasury department managerat Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking. WATCHING THE CENTRAL BANK Investors are watching whether the Japanese central bank orthe government will take new steps to rein in the yen'sexport-sapping rise ahead of a meeting between Prime MinisterNaoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa expectednext Monday. Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated his mantraon Thursday he is continuing to watch foreign exchange movescarefully. Japanese authorities seem unlikely to conduct yen-sellingintervention, however, unless the yen's rise accelerates sharply,market players say. The euro slipped after a Spiegel report that austerity stepsto fix Greece's debt trouble are damaging its economy but fallsin the currency were seen limited as the report provided fewfresh incentives. The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.2809 and support for thecurrency is seen at the 100-day moving average at $1.2776, whilethe upside is heavy around $1.2900, a trader at a Japanese banksaid. The euro was little changed against the Japanese currency at109.82 yen, after touching a seven-week low of 109.07 yen on EBSearlier this week. Japanese investors bought a net 2.18 trillion yen ($25.6billion) of foreign debt in the August 8-14 week, the largestvolume of purchases since the finance ministry started to gatherits weekly capital flows data in January 2005. Japanese investors have been net buyers of foreign bonds for14 straight weeks, picking up 14.52 trillion yen ($170.2billion). Japanese have bought a net 16.37 trillion of overseas debt sofar this year, already exceeding last year's total net buying of12.13 trillion yen. A source familiar with the data said Japanese banks have beenaggressively buying overseas debt, boosting the net buyingfigure. But banks' hefty purchases of foreign bonds are not seenhelping to rein in recent gains in the yen because banks hedgeagainst foreign exchange volatility when they buy bonds abroad orraise funds overseas to finance their purchases, the source said. Banks' buying of U.S. government debt is likely to havecontributed to a fall in Treasury yields and actually to havebeen more of a negative factor for dollar/yen, some analysts say. The pair's moves have recently had a strong correlation withU.S.-Japanese government bond yield spreads, which have narrowedas U.S. treasury yields fell sharply over the past few months.
