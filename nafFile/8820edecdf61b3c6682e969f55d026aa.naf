<raw><![CDATA[ * Nasdaq closes at 15-month high; Treasuries sell off * Dollar rises on back of higher Treasuries yields * U.S. yield curve steepest on record (Updates with U.S. markets close) By Walter Brandimarte NEW YORK, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Optimism about the economicrecovery on Monday encouraged investors to buy stocks and dumpU.S. Treasuries, while gold prices fell as investors expectedthe dollar to remain firm in the beginning of the new year. Speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interestrates sooner than forecast drove the dollar to a six-week highagainst the yen and kept it near its strongest level againstthe euro in three months. Investors are growing cautiously optimistic about theeconomy and more wary about inflation, especially after thismonth's strong jobs and retail data. Combined, those expectations inverted on Monday thecorrelation between a rising dollar and falling stocks that hasbeen in place in the past several months. "There's a belief that the U.S. economy is recovering at amuch more rapid pace than many people had previously thought,"said Greg Salvaggio, senior vice president of capital marketsat Tempus Consulting in Washington. "As a result, traders are a little bit anxious about thepossibility of a shift in the Fed's interest rate policy nextyear." U.S. and European markets were also boosted by merger andacquisition activity and rising energy shares, which gainedwith higher oil prices earlier in the day. The advance of legislation in the U.S. Senate that had beenstripped of provisions deemed detrimental to insurers and otherhealth companies U.S. markets an additional boost, sending theNasdaq to a 15-month closing high. The Dow Jones industrial average  ended up 85.25points, or 0.83 percent, at 10,414.14, while the Standard &Poor's 500 Index  gained 11.58 points, or 1.05 percent,to 1,114.05. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 25.97points, or 1.17 percent, at 2,237.66. Health-care shares stood out, with the Morgan StanleyHealth Payor index  up 3 percent. For details, see[ID:nN21199371. Aluminum producer Alcoa rose 7.9 percent after announcing ajoint venture to build an aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia, andon a Morgan Stanley upgrade.[ ID:nLDE5BK0I5] The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  jumped 1.4percent to 1,027.87 points, after two consecutive sessions oflosses, buoyed by energy shares. "Some of the laggard fund managers need to put more equityin their portfolios," said Heino Ruland, strategist at RulandResearch, in Frankfurt. "Some of us missed the boat. "There's no news out that would justify this sort of rise(today), and it's on low volume. I think the rally will gofurther. The economic recovery in the third quarter was strong,and it will also be in the fourth quarter." The MSCI all-country world stock index .MIWD00000PUS rose0.84 percent but the MSCI emerging markets stock index slipped 0.4 percent. US YIELD CURVE STEEPENS U.S. Treasury debt prices fell, with the 30-year bond downmore than a full point as investors looked to riskier assets. Bets that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interestrates in the future caused spreads between yields on two-yearand 10-year U.S. Treasury notes to widen sharply on Monday,taking the yield curve to its steepest on record. The yield spread between those two maturities widened to asmuch as 281 basis points from 274 basis points last week,according to Reuters data. Also weighing on Treasuries prices were worries about anexpected massive wave of government debt issuance next year.Trade volume was thin at the beginning of a holiday-shortenedweek, exacerbating price moves, analysts said. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  wasdown 34/32, with the yield at 3.6764 percent, up from 3.54percent late on Friday. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note was down 4/32, with the yield at 0.8639 percent fromfrom 0.80 percent. Higher Treasury yields, coupled with expectations that theU.S. economy might be recovering faster than expected, led theU.S. dollar to strengthen 0.93 percent against the Japanese yen, to 91.14. The euro  was down 0.41 percent at $1.4282 pergreenback. The U.S. Dollar Index , which compares thedollar against a basket of major currencies, was 0.32 percenthigher. Expectations that the U.S. dollar will hold its gainsthrough the beginning of the new year caused spot gold prices to fall $19.30, or 1.74 percent, to $1,092.80. U.S. crude oil  ended 1.21 percent cheaper at $72.47per barrel, after trading higher during most of the session.Traders said the stronger dollar weighed on prices of thecommodity, while trading was volatile due to the expirationupcoming expiration of January futures contracts.
