<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen pulls back from 15-yr high vs dlr, 9-yr peak vs euro* Market wary of possible Japan action on yen * Weak US durable goods orders weigh on dollar (Adds comments, details) By Vivianne Rodrigues NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The yen pulled back from15-year highs against the dollar and a nine-year peak versusthe euro on Wednesday on speculation Japanese authorities maytake action to stem the currency's rise. The euro see-sawed after strong German economic data, whilethe dollar pared some of its earlier gains versus both singlecurrency and the yen after a weaker-than-expected reading onU.S. durable goods orders for July. For more see. Traders were reluctant to keep betting on further yen'sgains after Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeatedhe would respond to yen moves when necessary. His commentsfollowed a Nikkei newspaper report that the finance ministrymay consider unilateral yen-selling intervention. Analysts said the report and Noda's comments offered achance for investors to pause the yen's latest rally, which sawthe dollar post its worst day versus the yen since May onTuesday, while the euro broke under a key resistance level. "The yen has come quite far quite quickly ... so we'reseeing some consolidation," said Daragh Maher, currencystrategist at Credit Agricole CIB. He added that news Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawawill attend a Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole in theUnited States later this week was also making some traders waryof extending the yen's rally for the moment.      Someanalysts said Shirakawa's travel plans had increasedspeculation that Japanese authorities may be preparing to acton the yen. At the same time, others argue the central bank isunlikely hold an emergency policy meeting in his absence. In morning trading in New York, the dollar was up 0.3percent on the day to 84.35 yen, within reach of a 15-year lowhit on Tuesday around 83.60. Traders said there was higher demand for short-termdollar/yen options with a 85.00 yen strike price asintervention jitters increased, adding this was supporting theU.S. currency. But demand for the dollar faltered after a report showednew orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose farless than expected in July. Excluding transportation, ordersposted the biggest fall since January 2009. "It adds to the slew of softer-than-expected data comingout of the U.S.," said Matthew Strauss, a senior currencystrategist at RBC Capital Markets, in Toronto. "Clearly the risk of entering into a period of very, verysluggish growth has risen," he added.    EURO UNDER PRESSURE The euro traded 0.2 percent higher at 106.55 yen,recovering from a nine-year low hit on Tuesday. The singlecurrency pulled back from the day's high of 107.66 yen. Analysts said the euro had bumped lower on concerns aboutfiscally weak euro zone countries, reflected in a wider yieldspread between 10-year Irish and German bonds, which expandedto its widest since May.      Standard & Poor's on Tuesdaydowngraded Ireland one notch to AA- with a negative outlook,fanning worries about euro zone sovereign debt and the bankingsystem.. Against the dollar, the euro was slightly higher on the dayat $1.2641. Risk aversion supported the Swiss franc and drove the euroeuro to a lifetime low of 1.2973 francs on EBS.
