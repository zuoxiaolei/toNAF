<raw><![CDATA[ * Rehn sees economic stagnation, political irrelevance risk * Prefers coordinated action to Germany's short-selling ban * Praises Italy's budget cuts  BRUSSELS, May 26 (Reuters) - The EU's monetary affairs chiefsaid on Wednesday Europe faced economic stagnation and politicalirrelevance if it did not carry out reforms and chided Germanyfor acting alone in banning some short-selling activities. Olli Rehn, the European Union's commissioner for economicand monetary affairs, said the EU was at a crossroads as ittackled debt problems in Greece and other countries using theeuro. "Either we take determined and joint action for Europe'seconomic and political revival or we face economic stagnationand political irrelevance," Rehn told an economic conference inBrussels. He later told Reuters it was vital for most of the 16 statesin the euro zone to accelerate fiscal consolidation and praiseda 24-billion-euro ($30 billion) austerity plan announced byItaly. "These budget cuts are very significant and go in the rightdirection. Such significant measures of fiscal consolidation asdecided by Italy yesterday do help restore confidence in theeuro zone," Rehn said. Confidence in the euro zone as been damaged by Greece's debtproblems and concerns that other countries such as Italy, Spainor Portugal could face similar problems. The EU also faces criticism for not responding faster to thecrisis, which has damaged its global image and caused falls inthe value of the euro. Asked about German moves to ban some short-sellingactivities, Rehn said: "We would prefer coordinated action."  "I do understand German concerns based on theirlong-standing stability-oriented culture and fiscal discipline,"he added. Germany caught markets and its EU partners unawares lastweek when the government's financial watchdog announced a ban onnaked short-selling of shares of Germany's top 10 financialinstitutions, and of euro government bonds and related creditdefault swaps. Naked short selling involves short selling a financialinstruments without first borrowing the security or ensuringthat the security can be borrowed. Germany also aims to "regulate further points" with a draftlaw it plans to enact, a German finance ministry spokesman saidon Wednesday. Such moves are intended to stabilise financial markets hitby concerns over the euro zone debt crisis. (Reporting by Marcin Grajewski, editing by TimothyHeritage/Toby Chopra)             ]]></raw>
