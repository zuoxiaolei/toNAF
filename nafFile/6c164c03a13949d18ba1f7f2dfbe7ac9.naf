<raw><![CDATA[ * Czech finmin: Eurobond possible in H1, 10-15 yr maturity * No more Eurobonds planned, but up to next govt * Drops idea of dollar-denominated bonds * Says Greece faces "very tough task" to cut deficit  By Jana Mlcochova and Jan Lopatka PRAGUE, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The Czech Republic may raise 1-2billion euros through a 10-15 year Eurobond issue in the firsthalf, Finance Minister Eduard Janota said on Thursday. Detailing the ministry's borrowing plans, he said he was nolonger considering a dollar issue and also planned no moredomestic euro-denominated or variable-rate paper which theministry used last year. The minister, member of a caretaker cabinet, said he plannedno more than the one Eurobond issue but his successor due totake office after May 28-29 election may change the plan. The Czechs, rated 'A' by Standard and Poor's, need to borrowa record 280 billion crowns ($14.70 billion) in 2010 to covernew and maturing debt as the budget gap narrows slightly amid ananaemic recovery. Market speculation of an impending Eurobond heightened afterthe ministry cut back a 15-year domestic auction last week afteryields jumped. Janota pointed out on a printed-out graph how yields hadrisen shortly before the auction, saying that was the reason forthe cutback rather than lack of demand, and reiterated that aeuro issue was not imminent although it could come by June. "We can issue a Eurobond still in the first half of the yearand I am serious, although originally I was not so stronglyconvinced about it as a bigger proportion of (debt) repaymentscomes in the second half," Janota told Reuters in an interview. He said shorter maturities could be more favourablefinancially for the Eurobond but he needed to take into accountthe country's debt profile and expected refinancing needs. "I know these days it is better not to go above 10 years (inmaturity). But I have to respect the development of the nextrepayments and I have to have that in some smoothed level. Icannot ignore that factor." "We will draft the charts... and it (the Eurobond) will besomething between 10 and 15 years." The issue will only take place if it is cheaper than issuingdebt on the domestic market, including hedging costs, he said. The Czech 10-year Eurobond yielded 17 basis points less thanthe domestic 10-year benchmark on Thursday. NO BIG IMPACT FROM GREECE Janota said the Greek debt crisis had not made a big impacton the market, with Czech spreads, or premia to hold Czech bondsrather than safe German bonds, rising only slightly.  The Czech 10-year bond yield traded 114 basis points overthe corresponding German Bund, up from 62 basis points at thebeginning of the year. Greek 10-year debt traded to yield 338 basis points over theBund on Thursday. Janota said Greek debt problems could affect other EUcountries. He said he felt sorry for the tough job the Greeksfaced in cutting the budget gap as required, or by 4 percentagepoints of GDP this year.  "I would not want to be in the shoes of the Greek financeminister, it is simply crazy."  SEES NEXT CABINET CUTTING DEFICIT Janota said he believed the next government formed after theelection would stick to his euro convergence programme, a planannually submitted to the EU which sees the Czech budget deficitfalling to 3 percent in 2013 from 5.3 percent seen this year. Opinion polls show that the leftist Social Democrats, whohave advocated extra social spending and higher taxes, have thebiggest chances of forming the next cabinet. Janota said the leftists' plan to hike taxes as well as somespending could work to cut the deficit. But a policy of imposinghigher taxes on corporations may have a negative impact on thecountry's competitiveness and exports, key driver of growth.  (Editing by Stephen Nisbet)             ]]></raw>
