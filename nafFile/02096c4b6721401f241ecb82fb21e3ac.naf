<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The euro pared gains against the U.S. dollar on Monday, pulling back from an almost four-week high after ratings agency Standard and Poor’s said the debt rollover plan for Greece may place the country in “selective default.”EUR/USD pulled away from 1.4579, the pair’s highest since June 9 to hit 1.4538 during late Asian trade, easing up 0.09%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.4426, last Thursday’s low and resistance at 1.4695, the high of June 7 and a one-month high.French lenders proposed a plan to reinvest half of the proceeds from maturing Greek government bonds into new 30-year Greek bonds. The European Central Plan said that it supported the plan, as long as it was voluntary.But S&P said that if the proposal was implemented they would regard it as a default event.“It is our view that each of the two financing options described in the Federation Bancaire Francaise proposal would likely amount to a default under our criteria,” S&P said earlier. Over the weekend, euro zone finance ministers approved a EUR12 billion installment of Greece's bailout and said details of a second aid package for Athens would be finalized by mid-September.Meanwhile, the euro dipped against the pound, with EUR/GBP slipping 0.03% to hit 0.9033.Later in the day, the euro zone was to publish official data on producer price inflation as well as a report on investor confidence, while markets in the U.S. were to remain closed for Independence Day.             ]]></raw>
