<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro edged higher against the U.S. dollar on Friday, but gains were limited as hopes the current U.S. budget impasse may soon come to an end lent support to the greenback.  EUR/USD hit 1.3545 during late Asian trade, the session high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3539, adding 0.14%.  The pair was likely to find support at 1.3478, the low of September 30 and resistance at 1.3592, the high of October 7.  No deal emerged after a 90-minute meeting between President Barack Obama and Republican leaders on Thursday, but talks continued into the night in an effort to reopen the government and avoid a possible U.S. debt default.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew reiterated Thursday that the U.S. will reach its debt ceiling on October 17 and warned that the political crisis is starting to hurt the economy. The comments came during testimony to the Senate finance committee.  The greenback also remained mildly supported after the minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting said the decision not to begin tapering stimulus was a "close call," fuelling expectations that the bank will begin to roll back bond purchases in the next few months.  The euro was steady against the pound with EUR/GBP inching up 0.01%, to hit 0.8469.  Later in the day, the University of Michigan was to release preliminary data on consumer sentiment.             ]]></raw>
