<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar hit two-week highs against the Canadian dollar on Monday as the Canadian dollar remained weaker following Friday’s weak domestic data on employment and trade.USD/CAD hit 1.0084 during early U.S. trade, the pair’s highest since January 28; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.0077, gaining 0.48%The pair was likely to find support at 1.0024, the session low and resistance at 1.0099, the high of January 28 and a six-month high.Official data on Friday showed that the Canadian economy shed 21,900 jobs in January, compared to expectations for a gain of 5,000. The unemployment rate ticked down to 7.0% from 7.1% in December.Meanwhile, official data showed that Canada’s trade deficit contracted to CAD901 million in December from CAD1.7 billion in November, slightly better than expectations for a deficit of CAD1.0 billion, but the report showed that imports fell faster than exports.A separate report showed that Canadian housing starts dropped to 106,600 in January down from a revised 197,100 the previous month. Economists had expected housing starts to fall to 195,000 last month.The data added to fears over a slowdown in the Canadian economy after the Bank of Canada said last month that rate hikes were less imminent, citing a weaker economic outlook.In contrast, U.S. government data showed that the trade deficit narrowed to the smallest since January 2010 in December. The upbeat data fuelled hopes that figures for fourth quarter growth may be revised upwards after preliminary data last week showed that the economy contracted by an annualized 0.1% in the three months to December.The Commerce Department said trade deficit narrowed to USD38.5 billion from a USD48.6 billion deficit in November, compared to expectations for a deficit of USD46.0 billion.Elsewhere, the loonie, as the Canadian dollar is also known, was lower against the euro, with EUR/CAD rising 0.54% to 1.3480.The eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers was holding talks in Brussels on Monday, following last week’s European Union summit.EU leaders reached an agreement on a seven year budget on Friday. European governments will contribute slightly less to this budget than they did for the previous seven year budget, following calls to curb spending by Brussels.             ]]></raw>
