The euro was on pace for its best quarterly gain in eightyears after data showed euro zone banks had relied far less onEuropean Central Bank funds than analysts had expected. Fordetails see: [ID:nN30337480] The euro  was last down 0.1 percent at $1.3604 afterthe earlier five-month high against the U.S. dollar. Stocks initially rallied and the U.S. dollar trimmed losseson rising hopes for better economic activity ahead after threeseparate U.S. economic reports came in better than expected. But the rally in U.S. and European equity markets was shortlived as traders reported many investors sold shares to lock-ingains for reporting end of month and quarterly performance. Gold eased but not before hitting yet another record highon investors seeking an alternative to a wilting dollar andfuture protection against potential inflation risks. The round of surprisingly strong U.S. economic data failedto snuff widespread expectations that the Federal Reserve willmove to increase money supply in a bid to keep the U.S. economyfrom falling back into recession. New U.S. claims for jobless benefits fell last week, a signof an improving labor market, while Midwest business activitygrew more than expected in September. Also, U.S. second-quartergrowth was revised a touch higher on firmer consumer spending. "Despite the good numbers, the reports are not solid enoughto prevent the Fed from adding more stimulus to the country,"said Joe Manimbo, a currency trader at Travelex Global BusinessPayments in Washington. Vassili Serebriakov, a currency strategist at Wells Fargoin New York, agreed: "I don't think it's going to change themarket's mind on further Fed easing, but I think markets willbe alert to further upside surprises to U.S. data in the comingweeks," he said. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  index of topshares fell 0.2 percent to 1,063.11 points. The index posted a7 percent quarterly gain, its highest in a year. The Dow Jones industrial average  was down 84.39points, or 0.78 percent, at 10,750.89. The Standard & Poor's500 Index  was down 7.90 points, or 0.69 percent, at1,136.83. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down 20.81points, or 0.88 percent, at 2,355.75. Equity markets in Europe fell for a fourth straight day asinvestors digested Spain's credit downgrade and Ireland'smassive bank bailout scheme even though the news was expected. "Both headlines from Spain and Ireland have been more orless what the market has been expecting, so there were nonegatives there," said Michael Leister, strategist at WestLB. European banks took 29.4 billion euros in six-day ECBfunds, almost half a Reuters poll forecast of around 50 billioneuros. The results of the ECB tender operation suggested regionalbanks need less central bank funding than expected, leadingGerman government bond prices to fall sharply. December Bund futures  fell to a three-day low of130.97, down as much as 84 ticks. Oil reversed earlier losses to hit a seven-week high above$79 a barrel, supported by a weak dollar. [ID:nSGE68T04L] U.S. Treasury debt prices were lower. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  wasdown 6/32 in price to yield 2.52 percent. The dollar index fell to an eight-month low, under pressurefrom investors shunning the U.S. currency, but later gainedstrength. The dollar was higher against a basket of major currencies,with the U.S. Dollar Index  up 0.32 percent at 78.939. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.17percent at 83.54. The Australian dollar climbed to a two-year high againstthe U.S. dollar  as investors bet that the Reserve Bankof Australia will raise the benchmark interest rate next week.[ID:nN30285299] U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose 1.7 percent to$79.21 a barrel. Spot gold  reached $1,314.85 an ounce while U.S. goldfutures for December delivery  also hit a record$1,316.20 an ounce before bullion prices headed south. Asian stocks outside Japan fell 0.4 percent but were setfor their best quarter in a year as investors poured money intoregional markets on the back of robust Chinese-driven growth. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan has gained more than 17 percent this quarter. Japan's Nikkei  ended 2 percent lower but stillposted its best monthly performance in six. On a quarterlybasis the Nikkei is flat, sharply lagging other major markets.
