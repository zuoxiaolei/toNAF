<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The New Zealand dollar was little changed against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, as concerns over the outlook for global economic growth and the handling of he debt crisis in the euro zone continued to dampen investor confidence. NZD/USD hit 0.81!Ã© during European morning trade, the daily high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.8181, edging up 0.02%. The pair was likely to find support at 0.8112, the low of August 8 and resistance at 0.8223, the high of October 8.  Risk sentiment remained under pressure after the International Monetary Fund cut global economic growth forecasts for 2012 and 2013 on Tuesday, justifying the recent round of central bank stimulus which aimed to support to the world's fragile economies. Earlier in the day, the IMF said the crisis in the euro zone remains the greatest threat to the global economy and warned that policymakers need to urgently strengthen fiscal and financial ties within the euro area.  Markets were also jittery amid uncertainty over when Spain will request a sovereign bailout and when Greece will agree with its international lenders on terms for the next tranche of funds.  The kiwi was lower against the Australian dollar with AUD/NZD rising 0.31%, to hit 1.2513.  Also Wednesday, the Westpac Banking Corporation said that consumer sentiment in Australia rose 1% in October, after a 1.60% inrease the previous month. Later in the day, the Federal Reserve was to publish its Beige Book.             ]]></raw>
