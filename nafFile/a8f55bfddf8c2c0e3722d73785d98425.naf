<raw><![CDATA[ * Nov industrial orders +1.6 pct mth/mth (Reuters poll +0.5) * Orders -1.5 pct yr/yr - Eurostat (Reuters poll -6.2 pct) (Recasts with economists' comments) By Jan Strupczewski BRUSSELS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial new orderssurged more than three times as much as expected in Novemberagainst October, boding well for economic growth in the lastquarter of 2009 and the first three months of this year. Orders in the 16-country area rose 1.6 percent from Octoberand were 1.5 percent lower than a year earlier, the EuropeanUnion's statistics office said on Friday.  Economists polled by Reuters had on average expected a 0.5percent month-on-month increase and a fall of 6.2 percentyear-on-year. "The healthy rebound in euro zone industrial orders inNovember bodes well for production in the near term at least,"said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. Eurostat also revised upwards its October orders data toshow slightly smaller declines than previously reported. "It is good news. It should help turn the inventory cycle inEurope and should mean good growth numbers in the fourth quarterin the euro zone, perhaps 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter," saidCarsten Brzeski, economist at ING. Industrial new orders point to trends in economic activityas they translate into production over the coming months.  The euro zone pulled out of recession in the third quarterof 2009 with growth of 0.4 percent. Economists have said thefourth quarter may have been weaker because third-quarter growthwas based on fickle inventory rebuilding and exports. Orders for capital goods, such as machinery ordered bycompanies, fell 1.2 percent in November against October, whenthey had declined 4.9 percent month-on-month. "This maintains suspicion that companies are still limitingtheir capital expenditure," Archer said. Excluding highly volatile demand for ships, planes andtrains, orders jumped 1.5 percent on the month and were 1.8percent lower than in November 2008. The orders growth was driven mainly by demand forintermediate and non-durable consumer goods, which jumped 1.8percent and 1.2 percent respectively on the month. "The orders data will be seen in growth numbers in the firstquarter of 2010 -- the fact that it was mainly intermediate andnon-durable consumer goods leading the growth would mean thetime lag would be rather short," Brzeski said.
