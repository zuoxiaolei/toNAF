"The Goldman news really changed the tide for financialmarkets," said Steven Butler, director of currency trading atScotia Capital in Toronto. "The market was already feeling risk averse even beforeGoldman. That news just accelerated the unwinding of riskytrades and so we're seeing safe-haven bids in the dollar andyen." The U.S. dollar and Japanese yen typically get a bid intimes of heightened risk aversion, given their normally stablebanking systems and their positions as the world's two largesteconomies. The dollar and yen had both risen on Friday beforethe Goldman news was announced, as investors again worriedabout the fate of a European Union-International Monetary Fundaid plan to help Greece avoid a debt default. As a result, the premium demanded to buy Greek governmentbonds rather than German bonds rose further. [GVD/EUR] In late afternoon trading, the euro was down 0.5 percentagainst the dollar at $1.3506 , just off a one-week lowof $1.3473. The $1.3500 level was seen as key because it marks the peakreached last Friday before the euro zone single currency gappedhigher after the weekend in response to the agreement on termsof the Greek bailout deal. The U.S. dollar also surged against the Canadian dollar,rising 1.2 percent at C$1.0130 .

The euro fell 1.5 percent to 124.37 yen , aftergoing as low as 123.88 yen. The dollar  fell nearly 1.0percent to 92.10 yen after falling as low as 91.91. The yen was already stronger on the day ahead of theGoldman news, largely shrugging off comments from a lawmakerfrom Japan's ruling party who said monetary easing andintervention to weaken the yen were needed to beat deflation.[ID:nTKF106921] The Japanese currency, sometimes used as a proxy for otherless-liquid Asian currencies, may have been boosted afterChinese President Hu Jintao said China has always acted on theprinciple of gradually putting in place a managed floatingexchange rate system. [ID:nN16136302] Hu Jintao made the comments in a speech, a transcript ofwhich was released on Friday. "The news doesn't change our view that China will belooking at flexibility in its currency regime and moving to acrawling peg," said Mike Moran, senior currency strategist atStandard Chartered in New York. "But the volatility that wehave seen suggests that the market is extremely sensitive toany news on China." Sterling, meanwhile, fell on concerns a May 6 UK electionmay result in no single party winning a majority, as pollsshowed the heads of the two main parties were beaten in a TVdebate by the leader of the third, the Liberal Democrats.[ID:nLAC005697] The British pound fell 0.7 percent against the dollar to $1.5389.
