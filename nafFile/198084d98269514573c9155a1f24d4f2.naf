<raw><![CDATA[   * Greek PM says EU/IMF deal needed to push reforms * Says ready to make the changes needed * Committed to cutting deficit by 4 pct of GDP By Dina Kyriakidou and Renee Maltezou ATHENS, April 28 (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister GeorgePapandreou said on Wednesday an EU/IMF deal to help his countryavoid default was not a bailout but would help push for longoverdue reforms. Greek borrowing costs have hit record highs weeks beforebillions of euros in debt expires, plunging Greece into a debtcrisis that has shaken international markets. European Union and International Monetary Fund officialsare in Athens to negotiate the terms of aid, that would come toover 100 billion euros over three years. "We asked and we received the aid mechanism not because itwill get us out of debt and we will go back to the samesituation, but in order for Greece to get support for thesegreat changes," Papandreou told an economic conference. "We ask for no bailout, we are only asking for reasonableterms on our loans, so that we can carry on with more creative,more innovative work." Papandreou lashed out at markets, which have been drivingup Greek interest rates, saying more regulation was needurgently before "the fire" spread to other countries. He said Greece's economic fundamentals did not justifyinterest on Greek bonds, which was prohibitive for borrowing. The spread of Greek 10-year paper over the German benchmarkrose to over 1,000 basis points after Standard & Poorsdowngraded Greece to junk bond status Tuesday and was around800 basis points on Wednesday. "This is yet further proof the markets do not regulatethemselves and they do not, by definition, functionrationally," he said. "Interest rates on loans to Greece today are beyond anylogic, and this reflects on the one hand a total loss ofsobriety on the markets and on the other hand the power ofspeculative pressure exerted on our country." He said his socialist government, which came to power inOctober, had launched more reforms in six months than hisconservative predecessors in six years, and vowed to cut a 13.6budget deficit by at least 4 percent of GDP this year. He warned other countries may face the same troubles asGreece if the international community did not regulate marketsbetter. "Yes, we Greeks do have our special problems. And we aredealing with them," he said. "Yet let this be a clarion callfor the wider emergency we are facing, which needs globalgovernance, global financial governance, and we need it fast."
