<raw><![CDATA[ (Corrects 7th paragraph quote saying South Africa will add2.8 million people, not 5 million, in next five years)  * South Africa has asked to join BRIC, investors sceptical * South Africa bigger economy, Nigeria larger population * Nigeria growth to outstrip S.Africa, capital markets weak  By Carolyn Cohn LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - South Africa, the largest economyin Africa, is eager for elevation to the coveted BRIC status ofemerging markets, but investors say Nigeria is a more probableAfrican contender, even if promotion for either is some way off.Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, at last month's G20meeting in South Korea, said South Africa had "applied" to jointhe four-member BRIC grouping of fast-growing emerging economies-- Brazil, Russia, India and China. Turkey, Mexico and Indonesia are typically the countriesinvestors eye as an addition to the BRICs, which have grabbed anoutsize slice of emerging market investment in recent years dueto their scale, growth and impact on the global economy. But resource-rich Africa, boasting some of thefastest-growing countries in the world, has become a focus forinvestors looking for high returns over a longer timeframe. Investment flows into Nigeria are tiny compared with SouthAfrica. Nigeria saw equity fund flows of just $216 million forthe first 10 months of this year, compared with $3.4 billion forSouth Africa, according to fund tracker EPFR. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^For graphic showing EPFR comparison of 2009 and 2010 inflowsinto South African and Nigerian equity and bond funds, seehttp://r.reuters.com/dyx79q^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     Yet while South Africa is the larger economy, Nigeria isexpected to catch up in the next few years. "In Nigeria, you still have 70 percent of the populationliving on a dollar a day, but there is a demographic impact. Inthe next five years, Nigeria will add another 23 million peopleand South Africa will add another 2.8 million," said Razia Khan,head of Africa research at Standard Chartered. Nigeria's economy may overtake South Africa's by 2023,Standard Chartered says, assuming South Africa grows by 4percent and Nigeria by 7 percent on a purchasing power paritybasis. Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O'Neill, whocoined the term BRIC nine years ago, told last week's Reuters2011 Investment Outlook Summit he was constantly getting e-mailssuggesting he added or subtracted countries from the acronym. South Africa, at a population of under 50 million people, isjust too small to join the BRIC ranks, O'Neill says. "How can South Africa be regarded as a big economy? And, bythe way, they happen to be struggling as well." Meanwhile, recent policy changes in Nigeria, including the appointment as finance minister of former Goldman Sachs bankerOlusegun Aganga, could present new possibilities. "Nigeria has shown some vague signs. If they could imposethe level of leadership, a whole new way of governance in whichcorruption is dramatically reduced, Nigeria is I think veryinteresting," O'Neill said.  "It's 20 percent of Africa's population, which means itcould be pretty powerful."  Nigeria's population already totals more than 150 million,larger than Russia's, and on some estimates could double in thenext 20 years. Investors are already targeting the African consumer andgrowing middle class, and a rising population would increaseconsumer demand. Acha Leke, a Lagos-based director at consultancy McKinsey,is cautiously optimistic on the power of population. "Demographics is a double-edged sword -- you have a massive,massive market, but you have a bunch of people to educate andcreate jobs for. This could be a great opportunity, it has to becarefully managed."  CORRUPTION WATCH Nigeria may have an edge over South Africa, but it still hasa long way to go. Corruption is a deterrent, with the country coming 134th outof 178 countries in Transparency International's 2010 CorruptionPerceptions Index, compared with 54th for South Africa. Some of Nigeria's biggest challenges include its inadequatepower grid and other infrastructure shortages. In the short term, political uncertainty is also an issuefor Nigerian investors ahead of April elections, with southernerPresident Goodluck Jonathan facing a tough battle securing theruling party nomination because of a pact in the party thatpower rotates every two terms between the mostly Moslem northand largely Christian south.  And in capital markets, South Africa is far and away thewinner, as the biggest financial market in Africa.  South Africa is a regular borrower in international debtmarkets, while Nigeria last week delayed a debut sovereign bond. South Africa is also a constituent of the benchmark MSCIglobal emerging equities index, while Nigeria is only in theless liquid frontier markets index. Andrew Brudenell, a frontier markets fund manager at HSBCAsset Management, says Nigeria's elevation to major emergingmarket status is not likely to be any time soon. "There is potential for Nigeria in macro-economic terms, thestock market is a little bit further behind. The question iswhether it becomes an emerging market as there are all thesechecks and balances -- liquidity and other financial criteriahave to be met."
