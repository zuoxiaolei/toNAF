<raw><![CDATA[ By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Investors have one overarchingfixation as they head into next week -- is China's volatilestock market going to trigger a global correction that will eatup many of the stock gains made since March? They will also be keen to get the latest consumer confidencenews from the U.S. economy, along with related data on houseprices. Japan, too, is likely to come into view as its generalelection approaches. But it is easy to see how much of the focus next week couldbe on Shanghai. The bourse's Composite Index lost more than 20percent in 11 trading days to Wednesday. That -- at least bytradition -- takes it into a bear market. Fund trackers EPFR Global calculates that jitters aboutChina during the latter part of that period pushed net outflowsfrom Asia ex-Japan and global emerging markets to 24-week andyear-to-date highs, respectively. The fear among investors is that a further fall could becontagious and nudge other risk assets into a correction afterso many weeks of gains. Concern may be overblown, however. For one thing, theShanghai index bounced back more than 6 percent in the last twosessions of the week, underlining just how volatile it is. Then there is the issue of low August volumes exaggeratingmoves. China's economy is also in relatively good shape, especiallywhen compared with developed ones. Factory output and capitalspending are both rising and the authorities continue to hold toa cherished eight percent GDP growth target. Jeremy Beckwith, chief investment officer at wealth managersKleinwort Benson, reckons the fall on the Shanghai bourse hasmore to do with the freewheeling style of domestic Chineseinvestors than on anything fundamental. "It hasn't led to too much weakness in the Western markets,"he said. He is backed up by the numbers. The U.S. S&P 500 andpan-European FTSEurofirst 300 each lost less than 1 percentduring the period of Shanghai's tumble. Whether this remains the case will probably hinge oncontinued support for growth in China and for improvement in theUnited States and Europe. "The risk is that the Chinese think that they have gotthings back where they want to be ... and tighten up (rates) abit," Beckwith said. The link between Chinese economic growth and Shanghaistocks, meanwhile, has been tightening over the past threeyears, with the bourse as something of a leading indicator. ------------------------------------------------------ For a graphic showing the relationship between Chinesestocks and growth, see: http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/089/CN_STKILLGR0809.gif ------------------------------------------------------ CONSUMER WATCH The reason China is so important to global investors is thatits economy has become one of the main drivers of world growth.Hurt less by the global recession than others, many are bankingon it pulling the world out of trouble. The other big driver, of course, is the battered U.S.economy, so investors remain on the look out for any signs thatit is poised to follow the likes of Germany, France and Japanout of formal recession. Consumer sentiment -- how prepared Americans are to spend --is a key to that and next week will provide a number ofguideposts. Personal spending data and the final University of Michiganconfidence reading close off the week on Friday, but only afterhouse price data on Tuesday, new home sales on Wednesday and theConference Board's consumer confidence report on Tuesday. Many are expected to show some stabilisation or improvement. "Pressure (on U.S. consumers) is fading slowly," Sarasinbank said in its latest outlook, predicting that house pricescould be bottoming out and new home sales showing signs ofrevival. If the U.S. economy can provide some of the upside surprisesthat have been seen elsewhere, Chinese stock volatility maycease to be quite as worrying for investors.
