<raw><![CDATA[* China subsidises all industrial sectors - EU trade chief * EU taking "more and more action" on Chinese state aid * EU firms fear Chinese retaliation on subsidy claims  By Terhi Kinnunen HELSINKI, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The European Union will takefurther action against Chinese state subsidies that hurtEuropean interests, but regulators need European whistleblowersto help them succeed, the EU's trade chief said on Friday. "We have come to the conclusion in the European Commissionthat the real problem with China is subsidisation," EU TradeCommissioner Karel De Gucht told reporters while visitingFinland. "We are taking more and more action in that respect." But EU trade officials rely on EU firms to provide evidencethat aid and financing programmes give advantages to theirChinese rivals -- and many EU firms operating in China arereluctant to do so for fear of retaliation, De Gucht said. "The big problem with subsidisation is that we need proof.We cannot start a case against a country... if we have(insufficient) proof. And that proof has to come from thecompanies," he said. "A lot of companies are ready to say off the record this isunacceptable, do something about it, but afraid of coming outand saying this publicly." The legality of Chinese state subsidies is coming underincreased investigation by the EU, particularly as Chineseproduction encroaches on sectors in which the EU hastraditionally been strong, such as cars and telecoms networks. That focus has heightened tensions between the EU and China.China denies its industrial programmes are illegal and isfighting at the World Trade Organization for its right tocontinue them. De Gucht said the EU would press ahead despite the tensions. The European Commission recently cited "massive" state aidfor China's telecoms firms as an example of illegal support. But subsidies are not limited to that sector, De Gucht said. Chinese subsidies pose a problem to the EU "not only intelecom, but in all sectors," he said. It has also proposed the EU's first anti-subsidy tariffagainst China over support for glossy paper manufacturers. Ifapproved by EU states next month, the duties could set aprecedent for similar cases, EU diplomats say.  "China is rather upset about it, but we are going tocontinue with that," De Gucht said.(Reporting by Terhi Kinnunen; Writing by Juliane vonReppert-Bismarck; Editing by Rex Merrifield)             ]]></raw>
