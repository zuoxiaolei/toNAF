<raw><![CDATA[ By Tamawa Desai LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Global shares rose on Thursday asinvestors pursued riskier assets after U.S. President BarackObama focused on job creation rather than any concrete detailsof banking reforms which had spooked financial markets. European stocks bounced backed from a one-week slide, butgains were hampered by concerns about the fiscal health ofsmaller euro zone countries such as Greece and Portugal, whosegovernment bonds continued to take a hammering. Market optimism after Obama's first State of the Unionspeech late on Wednesday pulled the dollar off five-month highshit after the U.S. Federal Reserve kept its low interest ratepolicy intact as expected but saw one policymaker dissent. Wall Street looked to open higher as U.S. stock futures rose0.2 percent . World stocks as measured by MSCI were 0.3 percent higher on the day. "(Obama) held off from being as aggressive as he has beentowards Wall Street," said David Morrison, market strategist atGFT Global. "The result was that the market was a lot happier." The U.S. administration's proposals last week on restrictingrisk-taking and potentially breaking up the banking sector hadfuelled a global market sell-off. European shares  gained 0.6 percent by midday trade,after rising some 1.3 percent earlier. Concerns about Greece and other peripherals weighed on theeuro , as the spread between Greek and German governmentbonds hit a record high since the single European currency waslaunched more than a decade ago. Budget proposals from the Portuguese government on Wednesdayfailed to reassure ratings firms [ID:nLDE60R0RX] [ID:nLDE60R0GZ]and the premium to hold Portuguese debt compared with benchmarkGerman bonds also rose. Credit default swaps, which indicate the cost of insuringgovernment bonds against default, also rose for both countries. "Sentiment definitely remains negative for the euro becauseof the Greece problem," said Lutz Karpowitz, currency strategistat Commerzbank in Frankfurt. "I thought the Greece story would eventually die down, butthat doesn't seem to be the cause, and there are more countriesin the pipeline (who are facing debt problems)."  BERNANKE EYED The U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady and gavea cautiously upbeat view on the economy. Markets will eye anexpected vote on Fed chief Ben Bernanke's second term in theSenate on Thursday. In Europe, German unemployment came in much better thanforecast while European Central Bank Executive Board memberGertrude Tumpel-Gugerell said it was time fiscal and monetarypolicy returned to "normal". Central banks are cutting back on the excess liquiditypumped into the financial system after 2008's banking turmoiland markets are looking for signs of how fast the ECB and othersmay complete the process and start to raise interest rates. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of thegreenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, wasflat on the day at 78.700 . It rose as far as 79.066, itshighest since August last year. Bernanke had been widely seen as getting the support heneeds but a recent surge of public anger at big banks has meantthe vote could be a lot closer than expected. His terms aschairman runs out on Sunday. Data due out include U.S. durable goods orders which areexpected to show a rise in December, and weekly jobless claims. U.S. crude oil futures rose above $74 a barrel, reboundingfrom six-week lows [O/R], while gold  firmed after thedollar eased.
