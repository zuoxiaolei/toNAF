<raw><![CDATA[ * Dlr index drops as low as 78.111, its lowest this year * Aussie climbes to 10-mth high and sterling hits 9-mth peak * Euro reverses gains to 2-mth high By Satomi Noguchi TOKYO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on Mondayand hit its lowest point this year against a basket of currenciesafter higher oil prices, steady global stock markets and U.S. GDPdata boosted investments in riskier assets. The Australian dollar, a commodity-linked currency, climbedto a 10-month high versus the dollar, helped partly by oil pricesholding firm around $70 a barrel in Asian trade after jumpingnearly 4 percent late last week. Commodity prices rose on Friday as data showing U.S. grossdomestic product for the second quarter fell at a 1.0 percentannual rate, below analysts expectations for a 1.5 percent drop,raising hopes that fuel demand would recover. The dollar's slide was driven largely by technical factorssuch as stop-loss buying in sterling, which hit its highest levelin nine-months, traders said. "The dollar looks set to fall further with the dollar indexbreaking decisively below recent lows," said a trader for aJapanese trust bank. The trader also said the sustainability of the dollar's broaddrop will be tested by a slew of U.S. economic data out this weekstarting with the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturingindex for July, which is due later in the day. The biggest market focus will be Friday's U.S. job reports asU.S. economy appears to be picking up steam even without itsstrongest engine -- consumer spending. Masafumi Yamamoto, head of FX strategy for Japan at RoyalBank of Scotland, said the Aussie would rise further against thedollar and the yen this week if U.S. data adds to hopes for aneconomic recovery. But Yamamoto also said in his note to clients that furthergains in the euro were hard to see with caution ahead of moreearning reports from European banks this week. The euro quickly reversed earlier gains to a two-month peakagainst the dollar in choppy trade as Japanese exporters sold theeuro to repatriate overseas earnings, traders said. HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, and Barclays are scheduled toreport half-year results later in the day followed by StandardChartered on Tuesday and Lloyds Banking Group on Wednesday. Results from major European banks are expected to be buoyantafter a strong recovery in capital markets activity this year,but losses on mortgages and commercial loans will weigh on theretail parts of the businesses, analysts predict. The dollar index, a gauge of the U.S. currency's performanceagainst six other major currencies, fell as low as 78.111, thelowest since mid-December, before recovering to trade at 78.337,near flat from late New York trade on Friday. The Australian dollar climbed as high as $0.8394 on theReuters dealing system, the highest since late September. Traders said the Aussie is being supported by expectationsthat the Reserve Bank of Australia may drop a key reference onmonetary easing at its policy meeting on Tuesday while keepingthe cash rate unchanged at 3 percent. The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.4248 after rising as high as$1.4310 on trading platform EBS, its highest since early June. Sterling jumped as high as $1.6780, its highest in ninemonths, before stabilising at $1.6737, up 0.2 percent on the day. Against the yen, the euro was flat at 135.02 yen afterfalling as low as 134.78 on EBS from the day's high of 135.44yen. The dollar was also unchanged at 94.75 yen.
