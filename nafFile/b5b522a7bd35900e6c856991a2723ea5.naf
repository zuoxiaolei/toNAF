<raw><![CDATA[ * Asia stocks up 1.2 pct on slower pace of U.S. job losses * G20 pledge on stimulus also a positive * Aussie hits 1-yr high, helped by upbeat job ads data * Asia ex-Japan equity valuations near '07 bull markethighs  (Repeats to more subscribers) By Kevin Plumberg HONG KONG, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Shares in Asia rose on Mondayafter U.S. data showed a slowdown in layoffs, while Chineseshares extended gains on hopes that Beijing will pull out morepolicy tools as needed to support its volatile stock market. Investors were also heartened after G20 finance ministersand central bankers agreed to keep economic stimulus measuresin place for longer. Major European stocks were expected to rise as well, withfutures on the Dow Jones Eurostoxx 50 up 1.1 percent.     TheG20 outcome, in addition to Friday's draft rules from Chinaallowing more foreign portfolio investment, helped give a broadboost to Asian equities. Even though U.S. payrolls data on Friday showed theunemployment rate jumping to a 26-year high, the total monthlydeline in jobs was the lowest in about a year. Economists at Rabobank said in a note to clients that whilethe worst U.S. recession since the Great Depression likelyended in June or July, "it is likely the labour market willthen take several months to stabilise before positive jobsgrowth resumes." Analysts have noted that the strong relationship of stocks,commodities and higher-yielding currencies rising togetherseems to be weakening, which some see a a signal that some ofthese trades are crowded just as valuations were looking steep. The Australian dollar and commodity prices, which haveusually risen along with equities, were largely steady despitethe solid gains in stocks. Japan's Nikkei share average rose 1.6 percent on buying oftechnology-related stocks and large exporters. Advantest Corp and other chip-related shares gained, buoyedby broad buying of their U.S. peers after Intel Corp's chiefexecutive said the need to replace aging personal computers andMicrosoft's launch of Windows 7 will prompt companies to startspending on PCs next year. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan rose1.2 percent, nearing the 11-month high reached in August. Thetechnology and consumer discretionary sectors, which have beenvery popular for the last six months, led the gains. Some analysts have warned that momentum, rather than value,is driving Asian stocks at this point, with valuations on thebenchmark MSCI index up near the 2007 bull market highs basedon prices compared with expected earnings one year forward. That one-year forward P/E ratio stands at 15.1 afterreaching 15.41 in August, the highest since late 2007,according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Shanghai Composite index of domestic stocks rose 1.1percent as investors jumped back into property-related sharesin the wake of Friday's draft changes raising the limit thatforeign institutional investors are allowed to invest in thecountry's markets. After plunging 22 percent in August, the Shanghai index hasalready bounced 9 percent after nearly five trading days inSeptember. BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset managers, saidit had already begun buying A-shares before the announcedchange in QFII rules but that shift was a signal that Beijingdid not want asset prices falling too much. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, which unlike the Shanghaimarket is completely open to foreign investors, rose 1.4percent, on strength in the large cap banks. U.S. stock markets will be closed on Monday for the LaborDay holiday. DATA BUOYS AUSSIET The Australian dollar was up slightly on the day atS$0.8522 after earlier touching a one-year high. The Aussie got a partial boost from data showing jobadvertisements rising for the first time in 16 months inAugust, adding to the signs of an accelerating economy that hasstoked expectations for higher rates in coming months. Short-term speculators on the International Monetary Marketonly slightly trimmed their net long Australian dollarpositions, but slashed their net long euro positions and nearlytrebled their net long yen positions, data up to Sept 1 showed. Short-covering was thus likely to blame for some broadweakness in the yen, traders said. The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 93.20 yen bouncing furtherfrom around 91.90 yen reached last Thursday, a near two-monthlow. U.S crude for October delivery rose 25 cents, or 0.4percent, to $68.27 a barrel. Brent was up 0.7 percent to $67.27a barrel Some analysts zeroed in on the more bearish parts of theAugust U.S. payrolls report which showed the unemployment raterising more than expected, despite a bigger than forecastimprovement in payrolls. "As the long Labor Day weekend comes to an end, we'relooking at the end of peak gasoline demand season in the U.S.,which means we're now entering a period of slack seasonaldemand with refineries scaling back their production," saidToby Hassall, a commodities analyst at CWA Global Markets inSydney. "High unemployment in the U.S. also underscores theweakness we're seeing in the consumer sector, which will put ahandbrake on the overall recovery in energy demand even as wesee industrial demand recovering." Gold in the spot market was down 0.2 percent to $991.60 perounce. U.S. gold futures for December delivery were down 0.3percent at $994.20 per ounce, after settling down $1 at $996.70on Friday. The contract rose to $999.50 on Thursday, thehighest since February.  (Additional reporting by Fayen Wong in Perth)  (Editing by Kim Coghill)             ]]></raw>
