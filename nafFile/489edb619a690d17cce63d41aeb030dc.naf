<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro pared back gains against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, as the greenback remained supported by the view that the U.S. economic recovery is gaining momentum.EUR/USD pulled back from 1.3285, the pair’s highest since March 8, to hit 1.3225 during European afternoon trade, up just 0.02% on the day.The pair was likely to find support at 1.3171, Tuesday’s low and resistance at 1.3331, the high of March 2.Market sentiment was boosted slightly earlier after the March 20 deadline for Greece to avoid a default passed.On Tuesday, Greece repaid EUR14.5 billion in maturing debt, just one day after receiving the first tranche of aid, under the terms of its second bailout. While last week’s debt restructuring deal had minimized the risk of a default, relief at the safe passage of the bond redemption buoyed investor sentiment.Meanwhile, the dollar was supported by the view that the economic recovery in the U.S. is gaining traction.Government data on Tuesday showed that number of building permits issued in the U.S. in February rose to the highest level since October 2008, while housing starts dipped only slightly.The euro was slightly higher against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP adding 0.17% to hit 0.8350 and EUR/JPY gaining 0.36% to hit 111.08.Later Wednesday, the U.S. was to release industry data on existing home sales.             ]]></raw>
