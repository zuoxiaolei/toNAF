<raw><![CDATA[ * U.S. Feb. jobs data, Bernanke, ECB meeting in focus * Divergent euro zone-U.S. rate view supports euro * Swiss franc hits record high vs dollar, more gains seen By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc may extend itsrally next week as tensions in Libya and fears of contagionprompt investors to seek safety, while the U.S. dollar's fatecould hinge on the monthly U.S. jobs report. The Swiss currency on Friday posted its biggest two-weekadvance against the dollar in eight months as investors fearedthe uprising in Libya could spread to other oil-producingcountries. A spike in energy prices could hurt U.S. consumerspending and crimp global economic growth. "So far the situation remains fluid. It doesn't look likeit's going away anytime soon. So as long as it persists, theSwiss franc should benefit," said Mary Nicola, currencystrategist at BNP Paribas in New York. U.S. jobs data for February, due next Friday, will also bea major focus for investors. Economists polled by Reuters areexpecting an increase of 178,000 jobs, up sharply from a meager36,000 gain in January. [ECI/US] A better-than-expected jobs report could boost optimismabout the labor market, which has been a weak spot in theeconomic recovery, and benefit the dollar. The dollar fell 4.7 percent against the Swiss franc overthe last two weeks, the largest decline since late June. Itearlier hit a record low of 0.9229  on tradingplatform EBS, before recovering to last trade at 0.9284, up 0.3percent. The euro last traded at 1.2767 Swiss francs ,down 0.1 percent on the day and off 1.3 percent this week. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke testifies to Congress on Tuesdayand Wednesday, and analysts think he is unlikely to suggestmuch appetite within the central bank for scaling back a $600billion government bond-buying program launched in November. "Fed Chairman Bernanke will likely repeat the logicunderlying the Fed's comfort in his semi-annual testimony toCongress this week. It is a stance that will continue toundermine the USD relative to its more hawkish peerselsewhere," said Daragh Maher, deputy head of global FXstrategy at Credit Agricole CIB in London. HAWKISH ECB? The European Central Bank is expected to leave interestrates at a record low of 1 percent next week. Investors willclosely monitor comments by ECB head Jean-Claude Trichet forclues about the outlook for monetary policy. Recent inflation-fighting rhetoric from Bank officials haveboosted expectations euro zone interest rates will rise morequickly than those in the United States. "With inflation rising, that could be a main concern, so wecould see them pick up their hawkish rhetoric," BNP Paribas'Nicola said. The latest positioning data showed currency speculatorsboosted bets in favor of the euro in the latest week to thehighest since October. They also increased long positions inthe Swiss franc. [IMM/FX] The euro last traded down 0.4 percent at $1.3743 ,reversing earlier gains that had taken it to $1.3839, to thehighest level against the dollar in more than three weeks. The next upside target lies around $1.3862, this year'shigh. A break above could see the euro rise toward the $1.3950area, the 200-week moving average, followed by strongresistance at the $1.40 level. The dollar rebounded on Friday, helped by a retreat in oilprices after Saudi Arabia stepped up crude supply. The inverserelationship between the greenback and oil has strengthenedthis week. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose 0.3 percentto 77.281 , after earlier hitting a low of 76.945. Higher oil prices and expectations the Fed will lag othermajor central banks in tightening hit the dollar this week,sparking speculation the greenback has lost its safe-haven roledespite tensions in the Middle East and Africa. But Adam Cole, global head of FX strategy at RBC CapitalMarkets in London, said risk appetite is playing "secondfiddle" to interest rate expectations. To suggest that the U.S. currency has lost its safe-havenrole, he added, "overlooks the upside risks to the dollar ifunrest in the Middle East continues to spread beyond a smallnumber of hot spots and hence spills over into a deeper andmore broadly based sell-off in risky assets."
