<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen falls on first co-ordinated G7 intervention since 2000 * Bank of France, Bank of England confirm yen selling * Yen dives in Asia but Europe falls limited * Traders sceptical move will work   (Changes dateline, recasts, adds quotes, previous TOKYO) By Neal Armstrong LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - The yen fell broadly on Fridayas European authorities sold the Japanese currency in the firstco-ordinated Group of Seven intervention since 2000, but traderssaid impact in European time appeared to be limited. Speculators such as hedge funds were keen to test theauthorities' resolve by buying into the yen's sell-off, with themarket still anticipating repatriation flows into Japanfollowing last week's earthquake and subsequent nuclear crisisto support the Japanese currency.Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Japan agreedwith central banks of the United States, Britain and Canada aswell as the European Central Bank to jointly intervene in thecurrency market. The Bank of France and the Bank of England confirmed theyhad been selling yen. The Bundesbank said they would participatebut did not say whether they had acted. All of which pushed theeuro to a session high of 115.56 from around 114.70. The dollar was only able to extend its gains marginally to82 yen after jumping nearly 4 percent on the day to as high as81.90 yen in Asian time on trading platform EBS, extending arebound from a record low of 76.25 yen plumbed on Thursday. Tokyo market estimates put the BOJ's earlier intervention at2 trillion yen ($25 billion) over the course of the day, similarto its big one-day bout of intervention in September. Traders widely expected the U.S. Federal Reserve tointervene when U.S. markets open from 1200 GMT. Traders reported heavy dollar offers at 82.00, helping topush it back down to 81.34. The euro soon slipped back to114.26, up around 3.3 percent from closing New York levels. "European central banks have been intervening but it's notgoing well," said a London-based sales trader. The G7 has long warned against excessive volatility inexchange rates. But many traders were expected to need to unloaddollars at higher levels and slow any advance, especially afterThursday's shocking plunge in dollar/yen that saw it collapsemore than 4 percent in just an hour.  Upside targets were at 82.45, Monday's peak, and then 83.30-- the intraday high from last Friday before this week'sfireworks. "The intervention needs to be concerted andaggressive....and even then I'm sceptical," said another traderin London.      The first G7 joint intervention in a decade capped afrantic week for Japanese markets that saw the Nikkei suffer itsworst two-day rout since the 1987 crash and the yen soaring asinvestors watched the country's nuclear crisis escalate.On Thursday, dollar/yen's break of the 1995 record low of79.75 triggered a cascade of automatic sell orders, some tied toleveraged positions and structured FX derivatives, in thin tradebetween the U.S. and Asian trading days.  TELLING HISTORY  While traders were sceptical any intervention would beeffective, Citibank analysts said the history of G7 actionsuggested it could reverse the yen's uptrend in the long run. "The last time G7 conducted a joint intervention was inSeptember 2000 when the G7 economies put a floor under the euro.And one month later EUR/USD bottomed out and then turned intothe long term upward trend which continued until 2008," saidanalysts at CitiFX in a note. "In terms of yen, the typical example of joint interventionis the Washington G7 in 1995. At the time USDJPY ended its longyears downward trend and turned into an uptrend," they added. Some others warned, however, that the likelihood that U.S.interest rates were set to stay low well into the future couldhamper any upswing for the dollar. As the dollar rebounded, the cost of hedging against afurther yen rise fell. Implied volatility on one-monthdollar/yen options was at 14 percent, well off highs near 21percent on Thursday and showing the market calming a bit. The euro rose to a four-month high against the dollar ofaround $1.4093 after the intervention in euro/yen. It was lastat $1.4053, up around 0.2 percent on the day.(Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano, editing by PatrickGraham)             ]]></raw>
