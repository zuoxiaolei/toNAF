<raw><![CDATA[ By Jonathan Lynn GENEVA, Sept 25 (Reuters) - World leaders promised to workas "quickly as possible" to conclude the World TradeOrganisation's long-running Doha round trade talks, and willtake stock of progress early next year, a draft G20 document atthe Pittsburgh summit said on Friday.  * The pledge reaffirms the goal of completing Doha in 2010laid out by leaders at the L'Aquila summit in July and repeatedby key trade ministers in New Delhi earlier this month. * The question is whether they will order their negotiatorsin Geneva to put that pledge into action by showing enoughflexibility to compromise on the remaining differences. * The Doha talks, launched in late 2001, are the longesttrade round and have missed many self-imposed deadlines. Memberscame close to a deal in July last year and WTO Director-GeneralPascal Lamy reckons 80 percent of the deal has been agreed. * Estimates of the value of a deal, which would be phased inover several years, vary. The most recent, by Washington'sPeterson Institute for International Economics, says it couldboost world GDP by $300-700 billion a year by cutting farmsubsidies and industrial and agricultural tariffs, freeing uptrade in services and helping developing countries trade more. * The United States is pushing big emerging countries likeChina, India and Brazil to open up more so the White House canargue to Congress the deal will create opportunities for U.S.businesses. Developing countries, who say they are supposed tobe the main beneficiaries, say this puts too big a burden onthem. * The Pittsburgh wording represents a compromise between theUnited States and other trading powers seeking a commitment tofaster progress. The European Union, Australia and Brazil wanteda deadline for early 2010 to reach a breakthrough on theformulas for cutting subsidies and tariffs in the core areas ofagriculture and industrial goods. The United States resistedthis pressure because of concerns in Congress about trade,according to European sources. * Once those formulas, known as "modalities", are agreed, itwill take many months to translate them into a detailed tradedeal covering every product, and to negotiate the remainingareas of a deal, from services to rules on unfair imports.Failure to wrap up modalities later this year or early nextwould jeopardise the 2010 goal for an overall deal. * In anticipation of a breakthrough, the WTO is trainingdeveloping country members on the technicalities of applying theformulas to individual products, a process known as scheduling. * There is broad agreement on the overall shape ofmodalities. The differences arise in the exceptions to theformulas that rich and poor countries and some individualdeveloping countries could apply. *  One sticking point is a proposal supported strongly bythe United States for some groups of countries to go beyond theformula and eliminate tariffs in some industrial sectors, suchas chemicals. Emerging countries are suspicious of this. * The contrast between the deadlock in negotiations inGeneva and the pledges from leaders has led both negotiators andministers to complain openly about a disconnect in the talks. * Key trade ministers agreed in New Delhi earlier this monthto intensify the talks in Geneva, bringing in senior officialsfrom state capitals regularly, to break the deadlock. * The officials agreed last week on a packed schedule, butin intensive talks this week on industrial goods there waslittle movement on either non-tariff barriers or sector deals,where members did exchange information about the shape ofpossible deals, but did not report any progress while Brazilsaid its economy would suffer from them. * The Pittsburgh agreement to review progress early nextyear also represents some slippage. WTO chief Lamy said onTuesday members should be able to take stock in December. * A long-delayed ministerial conference of the WTO, to beheld from Nov. 30 to Dec. 2, is not intended to negotiate atrade deal but ponder the long-term role of the WTO.             ]]></raw>
