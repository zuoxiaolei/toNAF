<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro rises on cautious optimism over Irish budget * Support likely to be fleeting, euro zone weaknesses remain * Dollar burdened by expectations of further Fed easing (Changes dateline, adds comment, previous TOKYO)  By Neal Armstrong LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on Tuesdayon optimism Ireland will pass an austerity budget later in theday, though support was expected to be fleeting, with the singlecurrency still dogged by structural weaknesses in the euro zone. The dollar was broadly weaker, slipping to a three-week lowagainst the yen, after comments from Fed Chairman Ben Bernankestoked expectations of prolonged U.S. monetary easing measures. The euro remained vulnerable with European policymakersfailing to come with new policies to tackle the region's debtcrisis.  An Irish Times report suggesting the austere Irish budgetwould be passed on Tuesday triggered cautious investor optimism. "The euro is gaining some support on optimism that the Irishbudget will be passed but I expect any rallies to be fleeting.Structural weaknesses in the euro zone remain in place," saidLee Hardman, currency analyst at BTM-UFJ. "It would be far more significant for the euro if the budgetwasn't passed as this would bring down the Irish government andexacerbate concerns about the debt crisis spreading," he said. The euro was up around 0.2 percent on the day at $1.3335,after rising to $1.3372, over a cent above Monday's low of$1.3246. Traders said strong demand from a UK clearer helped itto rally in European trade.     The picture was complicated by the dollar's own weaknessafter Bernanke did not rule out further bond purchases -- atheme that sent the greenback to an 11-month low last month. Traders said the fact the Federal Reserve could end upbuying more than its initial target of $600 billion ingovernment bonds meant it was not out of the woods yet. That view manifested itself most clearly in dollar/yen,which fell to a three-week low of 82.34 yen, after Bernanke'scomments helped it break out of a rough 83.50-84.50 range. Itlater steadied to trade close to flat at 82.70. The dollar fell briefly below its 55-day moving average at82.53 yen. Support was at the bottom of the Ichimoku cloud ataround 81.70. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performanceagainst a basket of major currencies, was slightly softer at79.530, having fallen in the past three sessions. The Australian dollar traded at $0.9924, close to a two-weekhigh of $0.9938 set on Friday. It dipped slightly after thecentral bank kept rates on hold at 4.75 percent and saidinflation would be little changed over the next few quarters. "We have February pencilled in at the moment (for the nextrate hike), but that sounds a little soon and we may have topush that back a bit. Sometime in the first half of next year."said Michael Blythe, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank inSydney. The Aussie also quickly recovered from initial losses fromtalk about Chinese monetary tightening. The official Chinese Securities Journal reported thatChina's central bank may raise interest rates this weekend toenshrine its shift to a "prudent" monetary policy in the face ofrising inflation.
