<raw><![CDATA[ * World stocks rebound from 10th straight day of losses * Wall Street up more than 2 percent at midday * Investors look to relief from Fed at 2:15 p.m. * Gold posts another record high (Adds quote, updates prices) By Leah Schnurr NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - World stocks rebounded from a10-day rout on Tuesday as investors looked to the U.S. FederalReserve to calm markets, though rallies in gold and the Swissfranc showed some were clinging to safe assets. The Federal Reserve has rescued world markets in the past,which may explain why some investors were pulling back from therecent gloom. But such expectation also leave markets open todisappointment should the statement after the Fed's meeting onTuesday be deemed inadequate. The Fed may have limited options because the current crisisis not liquidity-driven, as it was in 2008. The meltdown acrossassets instead reflects worries about faltering economic growthand paralysis at the highest levels of government -- on bothsides of the Atlantic -- in dealing with economic problems. "Short term, the market will hinge on what the Fed has tosay, but we think the next few months will remain volatile andit is difficult to say whether now is the right time to buy,"said Julian Chillingworth, chief investment officer atRathbones Brothers plc in London. In a sign of hesitation that the equity-market reboundcould be cut short, safe-haven bets were still favored as goldhit another record and investors pushed into the Swiss franc. Fears of a new global economic downturn, reinforced by adowngrade of the United States' credit rating last Friday andthe debt crisis in the euro zone, had sent world shares down asmuch as 20 percent from May's peak. MSCI's all-country world index  recoveredfrom early losses and was up 1.1 percent. The earlier drop putit on track for a 10th straight day of declines, which isextremely rare. The record is 13, back in the 1990s. U.S. stocks were up more than 2.0 percent at middayfollowing Monday's biggest drop in almost three years. Europeanshares  also bounced to close up 1.3 percent. "You had a cataclysmic sell-off in the marketplace," saidCliff Draughn, president and chief investment officer atExcelsia Investment Advisors in Savannah, Georgia. "You are technically way oversold and secondly, this wholething has been political." The Dow Jones industrial average  gained 173.66points, or 1.61 percent, at 10,983.51. The Standard & Poor's500 Index  was up 25.34 points, or 2.26 percent, at1,144.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 71.94points, or 3.05 percent, at 2,429.63. The Fed statement is due at 2:15 p.m. EDT (1815 GMT). It isunclear, however, what the Fed's options are, with interestrates already near zero and the central bank's latest round ofbond purchases having failed to stimulate credit demand. Fordetails, see [ID:nN1E77724B] SAFETY FIRST The saving grace for markets now is that the main arteriesof the financial system -- short-term funding markets andclearing and processing operations -- are not imperiled, asthey were in 2008. Standard & Poor's downgraded major clearingcompanies on Monday but it has not affected their operations. There were no signs of distress in overnight repurchasingmarkets, where institutions borrow money from one another usingU.S. Treasury securities as collateral. Treasuries, which soared on Monday, gave back some of thosegains in active trading. The 10-year Treasury note  was down 11/32, itsyield rising to 2.35 percent, erasing about 1/3 of the previousday's gain. The 30-year bond  was down 26/32, yielding 3.69percent. It touched 3.75 percent in overseas trading andhovered near its lowest levels since Sept. 2010. Higher-than-expected inflation data from China added toconcerns about the global economy. The country's industrialoutput also grew at a slower pace in July, with the centralbank trying to keep prices in check without dragging down theeconomy. [ID:nL3E7J91PZ] A Reuters poll found the United States faces one-in-fourodds of slipping back into recession, and a weaker economicoutlook is raising the likelihood the Federal Reserve will soondo more to boost growth. [ID:nL9E7I401E] Gold  hit a record $1,778 an ounce in its biggestthree-day rally since the financial crisis in late 2008. Itgained more than 3 percent on Monday. Spot prices retreated from the highs but were still up 1.4percent. The Swiss franc surged to record highs for the third day ina row against the euro and the U.S. dollar. The euro dropped to a fresh low against the franc at1.03550 Swiss francs  on trading platform EBS. Itwas last at 1.03880, down 3.0 percent for the day. The euro wason track for its biggest one day loss against the franc sinceDecember 2008. The Japanese yen, which also tends to benefit in times ofmarket stress, breached 77 yen per dollar, above levels thattriggered official intervention from Tokyo last week.
