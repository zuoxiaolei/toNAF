<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar hits 7-mo high vs yen; recovers ground vs euro * Japanese investors seen looking for returns abroad in Q2 * U.S. ISM index better than expected, boosts dollar(Updates prices, adds comment, data) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters) - The dollar climbed to aseven-month high against the yen on Thursday, bolstered byupbeat U.S. data and moves by Japan's investors to invest fundsinto higher-yielding currencies overseas to mark the start ofits new fiscal year. Data showing the U.S. manufacturing sector expanded inMarch at its fastest pace in more than five years furtherboosted the greenback versus the yen and weighed on the euro. "Definitely (the ISM) is a great number, better thanexpected and I expect some dollar strength," said Dan Cook,senior market analyst at IG Markets in Chicago. "The onenegative was the small drop in employment. Not something youwant to see in a week focused on employment." The U.S. payrolls report is due on Friday, with analystsforecasting the economy added 190,000 jobs last month. Thatwould be an outcome that would likely lift the dollar and boostexpectations for higher U.S. interest rates. Strong manufacturing data from Europe and Asia also boostedrisk appetite and the view that recovery is taking hold ineconomies around the world. That, however, kept dollar gains incheck against other major currencies, including the pound andCanadian dollar. "We had a slew of nice upside surprises from manufacturingdata in China, Europe, the UK ... so that's a good start to themonth and if we get a good payrolls number tomorrow, that's adollar-positive," said Matthew Strauss, senior currencystrategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. A spike in risk appetite also encouraged Japanese investorsto sell the yen as the new fiscal year gets underway. The dollar rose as high as 94.04 yen, according to Reutersdata, its best level since late August 2009. It was last at93.89 yen, up 0.5 percent on the day. EURO UNDER PRESSURE VS STERLING, YEN The euro was slightly down at $1.3502, as Wednesday'squarter-end buying faded and analysts continued to fret about adebt crisis in Greece. Traders brushed off a Bank of Japan survey showing a widelyexpected improvement in business sentiment during the Marchquarter. Instead, investors appeared eager to put money intooverseas currencies and assets that offer higher returns thanthose in Japan, where interest rates are seen staying lowindefinitely. The euro also hit a two-month high at 126.62yen. Sterling hit a five-week high against the euro of 89.04pence, with traders citing an opinion poll showing theopposition Conservatives could gain a majority in the upcomingelection, diminishing UK political uncertainty. The pound rose 0.4 percent to $1.5233, while the dollarfell 0.5 percent to C$1.0099. A strong Swiss purchasing managers' index boosted the francto 1.4151 per euro, its best showing since the euro waslaunched in 1999. The New Zealand dollar fell 0.7 percent to US$0.7056 afterthe International Monetary Fund said the currency wasovervalued and the government needed to cut costs and shrinkdebt. Optimism on the U.S. jobs picture was tempered slightly aday ago when a private report showed the economy unexpectedlyshed 23,000 private-sector jobs last month. Omer Esiner, a senior analyst at Travelex Global BusinessPayments in Washington, said that pushed an index of the dollaragainst major currencies off 10-month highs seen last week. The dollar "is still well within familiar ranges," he said."In fact, it's at the lower end of its recent ranges ahead ofthe jobs number. The support is coming from positioning aheadof this jobs data." (Additional reporting by Nick Olivari) (Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)             ]]></raw>
