<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was little changed against the yen in cautious trade on Thursday, as investors looked ahead to Fridayâ€™s U.S. report on nonfarm payrolls.USD/JPY hit 82.36 during late Asian trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 82.44, dipping 0.02%.The pair was likely to find support at 82.03, the low of November 30 and resistance at 82.60, the session high.The yen remained under pressure amid expectations that upcoming elections on December 16 will add to political pressure on the Bank of Japan to implement more aggressive monetary easing measures.Japanese opposition leader Shinzo Abe, who is widely expected to become the new prime minister, has said in recent weeks that he favors more easing by the BoJ in order to spur growth.The deputy governor of the BoJ said Wednesday that bank will debate whether to take additional easing steps at its policy meeting later this month.Investors were continuing to watch ongoing negotiations to avoid the U.S. fiscal cliff, amid hopes that lawmakers will reach an agreement in time to avoid the spending cuts and tax hikes due to come in to effect early next year, which could threaten the U.S. economic recovery.The yen eased back from eight-month lows against the euro, with EUR/JPY inching down 0.12% to 107.63.Later in the day, the European Central Bank was to announce its benchmark interest rate, while the U.S. was to publish the weekly government report on initial jobless claims.             ]]></raw>
