<raw><![CDATA[ * Chavez popularity could suffer after devaluation * Increased spending before election will soften blow * Inflation will jump this year By Frank Jack Daniel CARACAS, Jan 9 (Reuters) - A devaluation of Venezuela'sbolivar currency helps President Hugo Chavez's warchest beforean election this year but his opposition smells blood in theunpopular measure, which will raise consumer prices. In an attempt at jump-starting the recession hit economy ofSouth America's top oil exporter, Chavez on Friday announced anew dual system for the fixed rate bolivar. It gives a betterrate for basic goods in a bid to maximize revenue whilelimiting inflation. The new system devalues the currency to 4.3 and 2.6 againstthe dollar, from a rate of 2.15 per dollar in place since 2005. The socialist Chavez believes the state should have aweighty role in managing the economy. During his 11 years inoffice he has nationalized most heavy industry. Business andfinance are tightly regulated. The devaluation of the bolivar is politically risky butmeans every dollar of oil revenue puts more bolivars in thegovernment's coffers. That will allow Chavez to lavish money onsocial projects and fund salary increases ahead ofparliamentary elections in September. Opponents were quick to criticize the socialist president,who a year ago promised that the global financial crisis wouldnot touch "a hair" of Venezuela's economy, saying the move willmake people poorer. "By establishing the exchange rate at 4.3 bolivars perdollar, the quality of life for Venezuelans is automaticallydevalued since we now have half the money we had before," saidCaracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma, a Chavez opponent. Opposition parties, emboldened by public dissatisfaction atfrequent blackouts and water shortages and a 2.9 percenteconomic contraction in 2009, hope to strip Chavez of hisparliamentary majority in September elections for legislators. The devaluation is embarrassing for Chavez, who resistedcalls from economists and many government allies to make themove last year when oil prices were at their lowest andelections a long way off. "Venezuela's decision to devalue the Bolivar culminates anevent that the market has been anticipating for a long time,"said Walter Molano, an analyst at BCP Securities. "It helpsalleviate the country's fiscal woes and puts it on a soundermacroeconomic footing." The measure makes Venezuelan businesses more competitive bylowering the cost of its products overseas and making importsmore expensive. However, Chavez risks taking a blow to his popularityratings, which are about 50 percent, as prices for manyproducts inevitably will rise in the country of 28 millionpeople, which relies on imports for much of its consumption. Finance Minister Ali Rodriguez said the devaluation willadd 3 percent to 5 percent to inflation, already the highest inthe Americas at 25 percent last year. "The popularity of the government is obviously going to besharply and negatively affected," said economist Pedro Palma."The inflationary impact of the measure diminishes the realincome of people. People can consume less." The new two-tiered exchange system offers the 2.6/dollarrate for goods deemed essential, including food, medicine andindustrial machinery. Other products, including cars andtelephones, will be imported at the higher 4.3 rate. The devaluation also will affect foreign companiesoperating in Venezuela who will now have to pay more torepatriate profits. Economist Pavel Gomez of the IESA economic school said thescheme would increase opportunities for graft in a country thatalready is corruption-ridden. "Multiple exchange schemes are incentives for corruption,more so if they are applied in the Venezuela way," he said."Those who have good contacts can buy at 2.6 and sell at 4.3." Chavez, whose popularity usually rises on correlation withpublic spending, also said on Friday that the Central Bank hadtransferred $7 billion of foreign reserves to a developmentfund used to finance investment projects.
