<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro rises above $1.22 as Asian equities rally * Rally is risk-driven; Aussie/dlr hits 1-month high * Obama stimulus plans could undermine dollar  (Adds comment, changes lead; previous TOKYO) By Neal Armstrong  LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Monday as animprovement in sentiment towards riskier assets hit the dollarand prompted a bout of short-covering in the single Europeancurrency, lifting it further away from a recent four-year low. But analysts said the recovery in the euro was unlikely topush it out of its downtrend, as the structural problems in theeuro zone which had plagued the currency had not altered. "We've seen a good session for equities overnight. Thislooks to be a pro-risk move, driven by the higher-yieldingcurrencies such as the Aussie. Fundamentally, nothing haschanged for the euro," said Kenneth Broux, market economist atLloyds Banking Group. At 0728 GMT, the euro was up around 0.6 percent versus thedollar at $1.2180, having traded as high as $1.2208 on tradingplatform EBS. Traders said hedge funds had been seen cutting out of shortpositions on a break of the $1.2150/60 area in Asia. Theyhighlighted resistance for the euro at $1.2234, the 21-daymoving average. The euro has traded below the 21-day sincemid-September 2009. Technical analysts also highlighted resistance at $1.2330and $1.2445, the 2008 and 2009 lows.  The euro has lost 15 percent against the dollar this yearbut managed to gain 1.6 percent last week as it pulled up from afour-year low at $1.1876.  European Union leaders meet on Thursday and are expected tomake a new attempt to convince markets they can contain debtproblems by agreeing how to tighten economic policy coordinationand strengthen budget discipline.  EURO SHORTS BOOSTED Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed speculatorsboosted their bets against the euro in the week ended June 8,although net short positions were below record levels. With the market still very short euros, Sue Trinh, a seniorFX strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong, did not ruleout a push up as far as $1.24-$1.25 within its downtrend. "If the moves continue then we could start running intosystematic-type stops for the likes of euro/dollar and the DXY(dollar) more generally," she said. The Australian dollar topped $0.8560, its highest in amonth. Resistance was seen at $0.8570-80, stemming from a low inFebruary and a 38.2 percent retracement of its April-May drop. The Aussie also gained 0.6 percent on the low-yielding yen,which was soft across the board, to 78.70 yen, touching itshighest in nearly four weeks. The euro rose around 1 percent to trade above 112 yen forthe first time in a week. The rise in the yen crosses allowedthe dollar to make a brief show above 92 yen. The dollar was down around 0.7 percent versus a currencybasket at 86.880. Analysts said the greenback could beundermined by U.S. President Barack Obama and his aides callingfor more economic stimulus to support the economy. "With the market focusing on public finances, thispolitically motivated move could put the dollar under pressuregoing forward," said Broux at Lloyds. A top White House adviser said on Sunday the administrationwanted to speed up job creation. (Additional reporting by Charlotte Cooper, editing by NigelStephenson)             ]]></raw>
