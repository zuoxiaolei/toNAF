<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro steady; Spain sells debt, but banking worries remain * Swiss franc up on safe-haven bid amid Middle East tension * U.S. CPI data awaited at 1330 GMT  By Jessica Mortimer LONDON, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The euro steadied versus thedollar on Thursday, with solid demand at a Spanish debt auctionoffset by broader euro zone banking and sovereign debt concerns,while concern about Middle East tensions lifted the Swiss franc. Spain and France sold a combined 11.87 billion euros of debtat auctions which analysts said fared well, with a longer-datedSpanish bond notably attracting good bids as it looked cheap onthe Spanish curve. [ID:nLDE71G0Z7] [ID:nLDE71GOSE] The Spanish auction helped pull the euro off a session lowversus the dollar, though the fragility of the euro zone bankingsector was highlighted by a jump in emergency overnightborrowing at the European Central Bank. [ID:nLDE71G0I6] "The Spanish government sold the debt, but there areconcerns about the increased overnight borrowing at the ECB,"said Gavin Friend at nabCapital. He added that banking sector concerns should be enough toprevent the euro rising above resistance around $1.3625. Eurosentiment came under pressure earlier this week due touncertainty over rescue plans for German lender WestLB. The euro was down 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.3555, off a session low of $1.3537 when it broke belowreported stop loss orders at $1.3550. Support was seen above the100-day moving average at $1.3539. Against the Swiss franc, the euro  was down 0.4percent at 1.2965 francs, while the dollar was down 0.2 percentat 0.9569 francs . Middle East concerns helped the Swiss franc move beyond 1.30francs per euro as investors sought safe havens, though analystssaid a continued rise in stocks suggested that investors'aversion to risk was limited. "If events in the Middle East do escalate we will see safehaven flows which will help the Swiss franc, but equities arestill holding up for now," said Kenneth Broux, market economistat Lloyds. Investors kept an eye on spreading anti-government protestsafter Bahraini police stormed a protest camp on Thursday, whiletensions in the Middle East were underlined by plans -- latercancelled -- for Iranian warships to sail through the SuezCanal. [ID:nLDE71G00E] [ID:nLDE71G0CU]  DOLLAR STEADY; VOLS LOWER Against a basket of currencies, the dollar  was up 0.1percent at 78.252. Investors awaited U.S. CPI data due at 1330 GMT for anysigns of whether U.S. inflation is ticking up, after FederalReserve minutes suggested policymakers were in no hurry to shiftan ultra-loose monetary policy [ID:nN16297279] The euro and other major currencies remained trapped inranges. Expectations that spot prices will not move too far inone direction or the other pushed euro/dollar implied volatilityto 10.7 percent  its lowest level since September. "Vols are suggesting that there is unlikely to be a rangebreak any time soon," said nabCapital's Friend. Euro/Swiss franc one-month volatilities  fell onThursday, although risk reversals continued to move in favour ofSwiss franc calls, with the one-month 25-delta around 1.40 compared to a neutral bias at the start of the year. Options analysts said selling demand from hedge funds droveeuro/franc implied vols lower, adding that a move in the spotprice closer to 1.30 francs earlier this week had increased suchdemand.
