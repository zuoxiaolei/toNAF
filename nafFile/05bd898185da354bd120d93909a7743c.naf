The pair was likely to find support at 0.9314, the low of September 2 and resistance at 0.9416, the high of July 21.  Upbeat U.S. manufacturing data on Tuesday added to expectations that the U.S. central bank could start to unwind its asset purchase program at its upcoming policy meeting on September 17-18.  The Institute for Supply Management said its purchasing managers’ index rose to 55.7 in August from a reading of 55.4 in July, expanding at the fastest rate since April 2011. Analysts had expected a reading of 54.0.Investors were looking ahead to Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report which is seen as central to the Fed’s decision on tapering.
