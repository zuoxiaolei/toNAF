<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds more detail, quotes, background) By Jan Strupczewski and Marcin Grajewski BRUSSELS, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The euro is on the strong sideagainst the dollar and could strengthen more because of carrytrades and speculative play on its possible further rise, IMFEuropean head Marek Belka said on Wednesday. "There is such a risk, because we have a situation of carrytrades -- speculation on further euro appreciation and on thedifference in interest rates," Belka told reporters. He said the Brazilian real and the Russian rouble were alsounder appreciation pressure from such trades. He said that while the Polish zloty was also likely to besubject to carry trades, it was close to fair value. "The zloty is more or less where it should be, one could saythe zloty is in a good place," said Belka, a former Polish primeminister. Belka said the Chinese yuan was undervalued and itsappreciation would help fix global trade and savings imbalances. "One of the elements of the imbalances is the undervaluationof the yuan, there is no doubt about it," Belka said. He said the International Monetary Fund, which recentlycompleted a regular report on the euro zone economy, did notthink the single currency area would dip into recession again. "This is not something we expect," he said.  The euro zone economy emerged from recession in the thirdquarter and the European Commission forecast at the start ofNovember that despite weaker first and second quarters of 2010,when growth could be just 0.1 percent quarter-on-quarter,economic growth would continue. Belka said the IMF has recommended to Europe to graduallywithdraw blanket support to the banking system so as not tocreate speculative bubbles with easy access to cheap credit. "Those institutions that turn out to be weaker should betreated individually," Belka said. "The cheap money creates a temptation for some financialinstitutions to 'gamble for resurrection', to gamble that theywill somehow survive," Belka said. "There is a natural tendencyto hide behind the shield that central banks have created forthe financial system." He also said it was not clear when IMF funds could againflow to Ukraine, because the country's authorities could notagree on policies among themselves. "For us the partners in Ukraine are both the government andthe central bank so there must be agreement between them on thesteps that are taken," Belka said. "So far there is no unity ofviews there, and so it is not business as usual." He also noted that Ukraine presented in parliament a budgetthat was not in line with IMF requirements and that parliamentpassed a social standards bill that Ukraine could not afford. "We are now in a phase of a pause ... there are problemswith the completion of the IMF review of Ukraine because thereare some significant divergences between Ukrainian authorities,"he said.
