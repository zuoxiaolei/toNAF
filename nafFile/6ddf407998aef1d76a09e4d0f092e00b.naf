<raw><![CDATA[ By Natsuko Waki	 LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The yen tumbled from near recordhighs on Thursday after Japan intervened to curb the currency'sexport-damaging strength, while concerns about slowing globaleconomic growth pushed world stocks towards the previous day's2011 low.	 Japan spent an estimated 1 trillion yen ($13 billion) tosell the yen in Tokyo and London trading hours and is likely toleave extra liquidity from the intervention in the system. TheBank of Japan pledged to ease monetary policy further to bolstergrowth by buying assets such as stocks and bonds.	 Japan's action follows an unexpected interest rate cut bySwitzerland to weaken its currency on Wednesday.	 Investors anticipate the Federal Reserve and the Bank ofEngland may need to adopt fresh rounds of quantitative easing. 	 Speculation that the European Central Bank may resume itsbond buying provided only a brief support for the market as thefocus quickly shifted back to concerns about peripheral eurozone countries. 	 "This is going to be a long and drawn out campaign, since,for Japan, the Fed is more likely to cut than hike interestrates and thus the dollar remains pressured and for the Swissthere seems no resolution to the euro zone debt crisis," saidChris Turner, chief currency strategist at ING. 	 The dollar rose more than 4 percent to 80.24 yen ,having fallen as low as 76.29 on Monday.	 The MSCI world equity index was down 1percent on the day, although it stayed above the previous day's2011 low. The index is on track for its biggest weekly gain in ayear.	 European stocks lost 0.9 percent while emergingstocks fell 1.2 percent. U.S. stock futures were down1 percent , pointing to a weaker open on Wall Street.	 Speculation the Fed may buy Treasuries again contributed to a turnaround on Wall Street on Wednesdayas the previous round involving $600 billion bond buying whichended in June supported risky assets. 	 Last year's Japanese FX intervention and easing by theFederal Reserve led to Brazil's finance minister Guido Mantegato declare a "currency war" was erupting as developed economiessought to weaken their currencies to support export growth.	 This in turn boosted hot money inflows to emergingcountries, fanning inflation and helping trigger interest raterises by some central banks. 	 There were signs that some emerging economies were joiningthe developed world's attempt to guide their currencies weaker.Turkey surprised investors by cutting interest rates onThursday, while Russia refrained from raising the cost ofborrowing this week, both citing economic risks.	 "It seems a fresh chapter is opening up in the currencywars, with both Japanese and Swiss officials trying to drawlines in the sand regarding the strength in their currenciesthey are prepared to tolerate," Turner said.	 U.S. crude oil  lost 1.1 percent to $90.87 a barrel.	 The dollar rose 1.1 percent against a basket of majorcurrencies. The euro was down 0.7 percent at $1.4233.	  EUROPE DEBT WORRIES	 Speculation that the ECB may resume its bond buying provideda brief support for the market before the focus quickly shiftedto fears that peripheral euro zone governments may havedifficulty in funding their deficits especially when the globaleconomy is slowing.	 Italy's 10-year government bond yield wasabove 6 percent while Bund futures  erased early lossesto gain 10 ticks.	 Italy and Spain have been under increased pressure in recentweeks as markets feel the size of the euro zone's bailout fundis too small to protect larger economies if contagion from theGreek crisis cannot be stopped.	 "It's just the fear factor and worries over botheuro zone debt and the U.S. economy. I think sentiment isdefinitely on that ilk at the moment and it's hard to see anyjustification at the moment to step in to halt the rot," MartinDobson, head of trading at Westhouse Securities, said.
