<raw><![CDATA[ * Stability of the euro at risk so aid imperative - CDU * Greece must show it is progressing on deficit cuts - CDU * Opposition SPD calls for debate, likely to back aid  (Recasts with SPD, quotes, details) BERLIN, April 26 (Reuters) - German Chancellor AngelaMerkel's ruling coalition will back Greek aid because the euro'sfuture is at stake, but Greece must first prove it is tacklingits budget deficit, a senior official in her party said."We said we would help if the euro's stability is at stake,we're now in that situation," Volker Kauder, parliamentary floorleader of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), told Germantelevision station ARD. "However, firstly we need to check carefully that Greece ispressing ahead with its deficit cuts. It's not going to behanded over on a silver plate," he said. "We'll have to help,but the conditions for that have not yet been met," he added. Public opposition to a bailout for debt-stricken Greece iswidespread in Germany, and Merkel has consistently pursued atough line on offering potential aid. Kauder said he expected the ruling coalition ofconservatives and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) would backany financial support for Greece in parliament. "If the conditions are met, we'll do it. The chancellor hasalways said the last resort would be when the stability of theeuro is in danger. I think we'll get the majorities in thecoalition then," Kauder added. Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD) have threatenedto delay efforts to accelerate the legislative process ofapproving any aid, and a senior member of the party said onMonday it was important that any bill was properly discussed. The SPD's Petra Merkel, who heads the budgetary committee ofthe Bundestag lower house of parliament, told ARD it wasimportant to hold a transparent public debate on Greek aid. Asked whether her party, whose votes would not be needed toget a bill through parliament, would block aid, she said: "We won't reject it. We're going to look at exactly what'spossible and what alternatives there are," she said. "I alsothink we're likely to take the view that we'll have to help." It was vital that aid for Greece did not encourage otherdebt-laden euro zone members to follow suit, she added. The SPD could slow down the parliamentary process bydemanding committee hearings to discuss the aid. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble is due to meetparliamentary leaders in the coalition on Monday to discuss theeuro zone/International Monetary Fund aid package for Greece, ofwhich Germany could shoulder up to 8 billion euros.
