<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds background) MADRID, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Spain's Industry Ministry is intalks with the European Union over its plans to encourageutilities to burn domestic rather than imported coal, anofficial said on Friday. "We have explained to them what our plans consist of and itis up to them to decide whether our proposal may be understoodas state aid, or not," the official said. Seeking approval from Brussels will delay passage of agovernment draft decree, which Spanish coal mining firms hadhoped would come into effect in January. Spain's competition watchdog said earlier this month thatthe decree would lead to a "significant distortion" in theenergy market, because imported coal is less expensive thandomestically mined coal. The Spanish CNE energy regulator estimates the plan isdesigned to burn up 10 million tonnes of stockpiled coal, inaddition to another 10 million due to be mined in Spain by 2012. The CNE predicted the plans would cost producers anddistributors more than 800 million euros ($1.15 billion), andutilities have queried the government's proposals. Suppliers have said Spanish government plans, ifimplemented, will cut coal imports substantially. A major supplier to Endesa, the utility which operates mostof Spain's coal-fired plants, estimates it will ship 4 milliontonnes next year, down from 12 million. The predicted drop will be due to low demand for power andcheap gas, as well as government plans. Coal's share of Spain's energy mix has fallen sharply overthe past 12 years and made way for plants that emit lessgreenhouse gases, such as natural gas-fired plants and boomingrenewable energy sources.
