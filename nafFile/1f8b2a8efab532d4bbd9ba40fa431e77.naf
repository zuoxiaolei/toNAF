<raw><![CDATA[ * Sterling forecasts see modest upgrade from strategists * Inflation, rising chance of BoE hike cited as reasons * Pound expected to continue steady appreciation vs euro  By Andy Bruce LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Growing speculation the Bank ofEngland will fight inflation by raising interest rates soonerrather than later has prompted a modest upgrade to sterlingforecasts for this year, a Reuters poll of strategists showed. Sterling hit a three-month peak against the dollar onWednesday above $1.62, which nobody predicted in last month'spoll. Median forecasts from the latest survey of 62 foreignexchange analysts, taken this week, showed it weakening onlyslightly in the next 12 months. While they bumped up their cable forecasts by around 2 centsfor each timeframe compared with the Jan. 5 poll, they now seethe pound falling back to $1.58 in one month, $1.57 in threemonths and six months, before climbing to $1.60 in 12 months. Growing speculation that the BoE will bring forward a ratehike to counter inflation, which hit an eight-month high of 3.7percent in December, was chief among analysts' reasons for theupgrade to forecasts. "We still expect sterling to benefit from apparentlyresuming risk appetite, the consequent weak dollar andspeculation that the BoE will be forced to hike rates due torising inflation pressures at home," said Roberto Mialich fromUniCredit, historically one of the poll's most accurateforecasters. Minutes from the Bank's January rate-setting meeting showedpolicymaker Martin Weale unexpectedly joined Andrew Sentance invoting to raise rates in December -- and there were signs someof the other seven members were thinking about it too. Predicting British interest rates has become a difficultbusiness. A poll of economists on Tuesday showed on balance theythought the BoE would look beyond high inflation and keep rateson hold at 0.5 percent until the fourth quarter to support theeconomy. However, market expectations as measured by short sterlinginterest rate futures  suggest a hike before the middleof this year.  TURNING POINT? Sterling should be less volatile this month, according tocalculations derived from the standard deviation of forecasts inthe poll. Compared with actual volatility of 8.7 percent inJanuary, the survey shows this declining slightly to 8.3 percentin February. While the first batch of data for the UK's economicperformance in 2011 have so far looked largely positive, a turnfor the worse could trigger a profound shift in sterlingperformance from here. "We could well be poised for another major shift insentiment this time around depending on what the BoEcommunicates and how data pan out over the coming three weeks,"said Kenneth Broux at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets. Unexpectedly positive construction sector data on Wednesdaysent the pound to a three-month high, while economists expectservice sector PMI surveys to show further progress on Thursday. Against the euro, strategists largely retained theirforecasts for a modest sterling appreciation. The euro, which lost several percentage points against boththe pound and dollar last year, will decline further from itspresent level of 85.4 pence to around 83 pence in 12 months'time, the poll showed.
