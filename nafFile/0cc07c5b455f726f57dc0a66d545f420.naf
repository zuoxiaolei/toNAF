The move left the door open for more measures to curb thepeso's  appreciation and followed intervention byBrazil to ease the real's climb and Peru's buying dollars tocurb the sol. For details, see [ID:nN10255466] [ID:nN14108242] "The Board of Directors of the Central Bank decided toresume the accumulation of international reserves. To do this,it will purchase daily at least $20 million through competitiveauctions for at least four months counting from (Wednesday),"the bank said in a statement on its website. The peso, one of the region's strongest performingcurrencies this year, fell 1.43 percent to a low of 1,817 pesosper dollar from Tuesday's close after the bank's announcement.The local unit closed down 0.89 percent at 1,807.1 onWednesday.  The Colombian peso has soared 12.5 percent against thedollar this year, the sol  has risen more than 3percent and the real has rallied 4.5 percent since June.Brazil's currency weakened 1 percent on Wednesday after thegovernment threatened to step up intervention.

For scenarioson possible measures, click on [ID:nN15183902] Wednesday's "intervention announcement was relatively mild,which shows the authorities are still shying away from moreforceful FX market direct or indirect intervention measures,"said Alberto Ramos of Goldman Sachs. Traders said the bank bought $19.9 million at 1,805 pesosper dollar in its first auction on Wednesday after announcingthe restart of dollar purchases. Between March and June, the monetary authority bought $1.6billion on the foreign exchange market, but stopped greenbackpurchases at the end of June. "Surely this announcement will generate volatility andpressures for a rise in the dollar in the short term althoughit has been shown that this type of action cannot change thestructural tendency," Daniel Velandia, manager of economicstudies at the brokerage Correval, said in a note. "However, the uncertainty about the amount of theintervention will prevent an important fall of the dollar inthe coming days and we continue thinking that if the dollarrestarts its falling tendency strongly in the near future,there will be additional measures." Colombia's trade minister, Sergio Diaz Granados, said lateon Tuesday that after the government pushes through its fiscalplans, the central bank would have room to purchase as much as$9 billion. [ID:nN15156198] The central bank has other options available to stem thepeso's rise, including capital controls on short-term portfolioinvestment, though such measures would not be favored byinvestors eyeing a return to investment grade for Colombia. "History shows that this may be successful in preventingthe currency from appreciating further," Capital Economics saidin a report. "But it is unlikely to weaken it substantially --something the authorities are hoping to achieve." (Editing by Dan Grebler)             ]]></raw>
