<raw><![CDATA[ Oct 20 (Reuters) - China has curtailed exports of rareearths, causing offshore consumers to consider alternativesupply sources for the minerals which are used in everythingfrom TV screens and computers to mobile phones and toys. China supplies about 95 percent of the world's rare earths. Following is a list of winners and losers if China's rareearths exports dry up: LOSERS MANUFACTURERS * Industrial manufacturers in Japan and Korea, whichconsumed a fifth of the world's rare earths last year, would behardest hit by reduced Chinese exports. Sectors that would bearthe brunt of restricted supplies would be makers of metalalloys, magnets, catalytic converters and polishing compounds. * In the United States, manufacturers of catalyticconverters would suffer the most, followed by the metalalloying and ceramic-making sectors. * European Union consumers would face shortages mainly inmanufacturing of catalytic converters, given the highconcentration of auto-making in the region. WINNERS MINERS * Some new and mothballed rare earths producers wouldlikely get the green light to proceed if China's exports driedup. Many of these projects did not make economic sense whileChina completely dominated the market. The major projects are: * Mountain Pass, located in the United States and owned byMolycorp Minerals: once the world's largest producer of rareearths, the mine ceased removing ore from its open pit in 2002.Molycorp has continued some production from existing stocks andplans to restart mining an annual rate of 18,000 tonnes in2012.* Hoidas Lake (Canada, Great Western Minerals Group): theproject is at an advanced exploration stage with start-uptentatively scheduled for post-2014 at an annual rate of3,000-5000 tonnes a year.* Nechalacho (Canada, Avalon Ventures Inc): earlyexploration and costing work is underway to develop a projectin about five years producing 3,000-5,000 tonnes a year.* Mt Weld (Australia, Lynas Corp): due to start up in 2011,initially producing about 10,500 tonnes, rising to 21,000tonnes annually in 2013.* Dubbo Zirconia (Australia, Alkane Resources): could beactivated as early as 2013 at an annual rate of 2,500 tonnes. * Nolans (Australia, Arafura Resources): tentativelyscheduled to be in production in 2014 and operating at anannual rate of 20,000 tonnes.* Kvanefjeld (Greenland, Greenland Minerals & Energy): themine is being designed to produce 20,000 tonnes of rare earthsas a co-product to uranium. No start date has been disclosed.  (Reporting by James Regan; Editing by Mark Bendeich)             ]]></raw>
