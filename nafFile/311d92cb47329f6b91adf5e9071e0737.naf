<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro slips after widely expected ECB rate rise * C.bank raises rates by 25 bps, Trichet news conferenceawaited * Tone of Trichet news conference key for euro direction By Nia Williams and Naomi Tajitsu	 LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Thursday,failing to benefit from a widely expected interest rate rise bythe European Central Bank as investors speculated the bank maysignal a more dovish stance on policy for the coming months. 	 The euro slipped to a session low of $1.4251, down0.4 percent on the day, after the ECB delivered a 25 basis pointrate rise to 1.50 percent. 	 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet will address reporters at1230 GMT. Investors were on tenterhooks to see if he wouldsignal another rate rise this year in the face of inflationrisks, even as the euro zone suffers from debt problems whileeconomic growth remains patchy.	 Traders said last-minute selling by large banks before therate decision had pressured the euro lower, while analysts saidinvestors were betting on more euro losses later in the day.	 "The market is still slightly short euros because there aredoubts also to whether the ECB can sustain its current ratepath," said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS. 	 He said the ECB may not be able to keep its hawkish stanceon rates if economic growth slows in Germany, the bloc'sstrongest nation.	 Any indication the ECB will put its tightening cycle on holdcould repel investors buying the euro for its favourable ratedifferentials versus the dollar, a key pillar of support for thesingle currency beset by Greek debt problems.	 "People would use that as an opportunity to add to shortpositions in the euro. The reaction to an ECB surprise istypically about 100 pips so the euro could go down to $1.4200,"said George Saravelos, FX strategist at Deutsche Bank.	 Analysts will scrutinise Trichet comments for insight intothe ECB's policy outlook, with some offering hints ondeciphering his rhetoric.	 "If Trichet uses 'Monitor very closely' on inflation andre-iterates that monetary policy is 'Very accommodative', thisshould be interpreted as the next hike being not more than threeto four months away," Danske analysts said in a note.	 "(If he) steps up the rhetoric a bit more and says 'Veryclose monitoring', thereby signalling that the next hike couldbe only two to three months away, the market reaction will bemore significant," they added.	  A ramp up in rhetoric could push the currency higher, theysaid, as many in the market are currently pricing the next hikein November or December. 	 But Danske analysts said any upside could be limited asweekly data has shown speculators remain net long on the euro,betting it will appreciate.	 On the flipside, they said a reference to current policy as"accommodative" -- toning down the language from "veryaccommodative" used recently -- would be considered as a dovishstance, which may trigger euro selling.		 EURO RISKS	 The euro was on the back foot versus other currencies,hovering at a session low versus sterling of 89.25 pence .	 The euro traded at 1.2060 francs, up slightly onthe day, but it hovered in range of a lifetime low around 1.1800hit late last month, as the safe-haven franc has benefited fromthe flare up in sovereign debt concerns. 	 "Our flow has been really mixed," a London trader said."It's going to be messy today but I'm selling any euro rally."	 The options market also indicated the risk of substantialeuro upside is limited by continuing concerns over peripheraleuro zone debt. 	 The euro zone debt crisis gained fresh legs this week afterratings agency Moody's slashed its rating for Portugal to junkstatus, fuelling worries that Greece's debt problems couldengulf other countries within the euro zone. 	 The issue has been weighing on the market and could add tobearish sentiment on the euro if Trichet sticks to his line todate and offers no sign of how a solution can be reached.	 "We have growing disparity between the underperformingperiphery and the largely resilient core of the euro zone. Thisdisparity is causing a dilemma for the ECB," said Citi analystValentin Marinov. "I suspect the euro will continue tounderperform other risk-correlated currencies as a result."	 The dollar was flat at 80.93 yen , staying within awell-worn range roughly between 79.80 and 81.30. Against acurrency basket , the dollar rose 0.2 percent to 75.279.	 Overall, the dollar has failed to gain significantly fromeuro weakness as concerns about the United States' own budgetdeficit praying on investors' minds.	 U.S. non-farm payrolls for June are due on Friday and areexpected to have expanded modestly from May's weak figure butremain low at around 110,000. 	 A second month of weak payrolls would point to a soft patchin the U.S. economy and weigh on the greenback.	Better-than-expected Australian employment data helped the Australian dollar climb 0.3 percent on the day, whilethe New Zealand dollar was flat at $0.8268, not far offa 30-year peak of $0.8332 set this week.
