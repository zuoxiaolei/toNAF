<raw><![CDATA[ * Economy, euro zone continue to weigh * World stocks heading for weekly loss * Euro slips  By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, June 10 (Reuters) - World stocks headed for theirfifth weekly loss out of the past six on Friday, depressed byconcerns about a slowing global economy and by Europe's ongoingstruggle to control Greek debt. Wall Street also looked set to open lower. The euro slipped against the dollar despite the EuropeanCentral Bank's all-but-official confirmation that it will raiseinterest rates in July. Brent oil hit a five week high and U.S. crude reached over$102 a barrel but both later slipped back after Saudi Arabiabegan offering more oil to Asian refiners, easing worries aboutsupplies following an inconclusive OPEC meeting.  MSCI's all-country world stock index  wasdown a quarter of a percent, losing more than 6 percent over six weeks and gaining only 1.5 percent for the year to date. Some worries about the state of the world economy wereassuaged on Thursday by better-than-expected U.S. trade deficitdata, which may imply stronger second-quarter growth thanexpected. But the euro zone debt troubles and a generally defensivestance by many investors pulled stocks lower."Even though in our base scenario we still believe that thisis a temporary slowdown and that economic growth will pick uplater in the year, the markets will continue to be nervous andvolatile in the meantime," said Philippe Gijsels, head ofresearch at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels. Stresses in the euro zone remained firmly in place, despitemoves by Greece to institute a new austerity plan and someprogress among euro zone leaders to agree a new bail out. European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet appearedto be at loggerheads with Germany over the role that privateinvestors might play in some kind of refinancing of Greek debt. The FTSEurofirst 300  stock index was down 0.4percent. Earlier Japan's Nikkei  closed up half apercent.  EURO WEAKER The euro struggled to keep its footing as the worries aboutdebt problems overwhelmed any support from a likely interestrate rise by the European Central Bank next month. "The image of European policymakers and the ECB standing toeto toe on this particular issue is something investors finddeeply unsettling," said Michael Derks, chief strategist atFXPro. The euro was down a third of a percent at $1.4462 ,although it got a brief boost when Germany's Bundestag voted infavour of a motion to approve new aid for Greece. Core euro zone debt was generally a bit stronger, but therewas more pressure on the periphery. The premium investors demand to hold Spanish and otherlower-rated government bonds rather than benchmark German Bundsrose. Five-year credit default swaps (CDS) on Greek governmentdebt rose 25 basis points to 1,545 basis points, according todata monitor Markit. This means it costs 1.545 million euros toprotect 10 million euros of exposure to Greek bonds. Spanish CDS were 9 basis points up at 269 basis points,while Portuguese CDS were 12 basis points higher at 725 basispoints. Ireland's were 8 basis points higher at 695 basispoints.
