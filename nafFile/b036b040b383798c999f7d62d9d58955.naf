<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro bounces off low to trade near flat * Above-forecast German factory orders help euro * Dollar seen as safe haven when risk aversion rises * Euro zone debt, Hungary concerns linger (Adds comments, details; changes byline) By Steven C. Johnson and Vivianne Rodrigues NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - The euro fell below $1.19 onMonday for the first time in more than four years, butrecovered some losses as strong German manufacturing dataprompted investors to book profits after the currency's recentslide. European corporate demand helped the euro rebound after ittouched $1.1876  -- its weakest level since March2006. But it remained well below $1.20, a key psychological levelpierced on Friday after Hungary's warning about its deficitstoked investor worries of the severe debt problems plaguingsome European countries. "After Hungary's warning and weaker-than-expected U.S. jobsdata on Friday, selling got a bit overdone," said AmeliaBourdeau, senior strategist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut. "But what investors are doing is waiting for short squeezeslike this that push the euro up and then preparing to re-entershort positions," she added. "Things were overdone last weekbut there isn't much on the horizon that's euro-positive." Data on Friday showed speculators trimmed net shortpositions on the euro slightly in the week ended June 1, butwere still heavily positioned against the currency, which haslost nearly 17 percent against the dollar in 2010. [IMM/FX] The euro  last traded down 0.1 percent at $1.1961. OnFriday, it tumbled 1.5 percent after a weaker-than-expectedU.S. jobs report suggested the global recovery may be runningout of steam diminished investor taste for risk and enhancedthe dollar's safe-haven appeal. Stocks traded near flat aftertumbling on Friday. The euro was down little changed at 110.03 yen while the dollar rose 0.1 percent to 91.99 yen . The eurohit a record low at earlier 1.3850 Swiss francs , down0.4 percent. The yen and Swiss franc, along with the dollar, typicallygain when risk aversion is high, while investors tend to avoidcurrencies tied more closely to growth or commodity prices,such as the Australian dollar , which fell 0.5 percentto $0.8196 on Monday. Sterling rose 0.2 percent to $1.4490  while theeuro earlier fell to an 18-month low at 82.12 pence as traders said investors were moving out of German bunds andinto UK gilts amid fears of continued debt woes in the eurozone. Traders say the next option trigger for the euro comes at$1.1850 and a likely target at $1.1825, the euro's March 2006low. Below that, traders saw little support until its November2005 low of $1.1638, though the euro's 1999 launch level of$1.1747 was also a potential key marker. But the road there will be a winding one. The euro's "comean awfully long way in recent days and it won't head lower in astraight line," said Paul Robson, a currency strategist at RBSin London. DATA BOOST, DEBT WOES PERSIST A bigger-than-expected jump in German industrial orders andreasonable demand at an offer of Belgian government debt werehelping to bolster the euro Monday, market participants said.[ID:nTAR001846] [ID:nLDE656107] But debt concerns have not disappeared. Hungary -- a member of the European Union but not the eurozone -- added to market jitters on Friday when the incominggovernment said the country might be facing a Greek-stylecrisis. [ID:nLDE6550I7] That reignited fears about European banks' exposure to thedebt of some European countries. While the problems in Hungary are not considered as severeas those in Greece, some analysts say it may be more vulnerableto crisis since it is not in the euro zone and does not use theeuro. "Greece can't devalue or easily default on its debt, butpresumably Hungary can, so it's a double-edged blade," saidMichael Woolfolk, senior strategist at BNY Mellon in New York. Euro zone governments will issue about 27.5 billion eurosworth of new bonds this week, with Spain, Portugal and Italyall due to hold auctions. [GVD/EUR]             ]]></raw>
