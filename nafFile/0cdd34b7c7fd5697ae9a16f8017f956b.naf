<raw><![CDATA[* Euro slips 0.4 percent ahead of euro zone finmin meeting * Investors anxious for deal on boosting euro safety fund * Global stocks dip; Smiths, BP keep Europe shares positive  By Jessica Mortimer LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against thedollar on Monday while global stocks dipped as hopes of swiftaction from policymakers to boost the euro zone's rescue fundfaded ahead of a meeting of finance ministers. A debate on increasing the effective lending capacity of theEuropean Financial Stability Facility is expected to dominatethe meeting, but concerns about whether officials can reachagreement weighed on market sentiment. The euro extended falls as European Central Bank policymakerAthanasios Orphanides was quoted saying the market may haveoverreacted to the ECB's statement last week. The bank's warningon inflation had prompted investors to bring forward bets on thetiming of a first rise in euro zone interest rates, sending theeuro to a one-month high. "Expectations for tighter ECB monetary policy measuresaren't going to go away. But higher rates and a cobbled togetherrescue package for the euro zone aren't positive for the euro inthe long run," said Ian Stannard, senior currency strategist atBNP Paribas. The euro lost 0.4 percent on the day against the dollar at$1.3316, having rallied some 4 percent last week to a high of$1.3458 on Friday. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was up 0.1 percent at 79.249. Ministers will discuss an increase in the fund, but therewas a growing realisation that a deal was not imminent, withFrance saying it would be March before a firm plan was in place. "It's becoming increasingly apparent that Germany doesn'twant an increase in the rescue fund and that's weighing on eurosentiment today because there were positive expectationsbuilding last week," said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist atUBS in Zurich. Some analysts pointed to a Feb. 4 European Council meetingas a more likely stage for such decisions to be made, thoughthis week's meeting should give investors a sense of how muchagreement there is among euro zone members to enlarging thefacility. German Bund futures were 6 ticks higher at 124.96.

With U.S. markets closed on Monday, the focus was on eventsin Europe, with news that Spain was opting for the syndicatedsale of its debt instead of an open auction driving its bondyields back up after a recovery in recent sessions. European shares, however, edged up 0.1 percent, lifted bygains in oil shares and a surge in British engineering firmSmiths Group after it rejected a bid for its medical servicesunit, which offset falls in mining stocks. Oil stocks were led higher by BP following the share swapand arctic exploration deal that the London-based oil majorsigned with Russia's Rosneft late on Friday.  Commodity prices were broadly lower on a firmer dollar andahead of the euro zone meeting. U.S. crude oil was down 30 cents at $91.24 a barrel, whileICE Brent for March lost 37 cents to $98.01, staying not farbelow $100, a level not seen since the beginning of October2008. "The oil price has been in an uptrend since the middle ofNovember and now we are getting close to $100.
