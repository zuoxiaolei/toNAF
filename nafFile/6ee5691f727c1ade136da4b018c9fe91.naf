<raw><![CDATA[   (Adds U.S. government, industry comment) BEIJING, April 12 (Reuters) - China has imposedanti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on a U.S. specialty steelproduct, and also hit Russia with anti-dumping duties in thesame case, its customs administration said. U.S. producers will be assessed anti-dumping duties of upto 64.8 percent and anti-subsidy, or "countervailing," dutiesof up to 44.6 percent on the grain-oriented electrical steel,it said on its website on Monday. Grain-oriented electrical steel, also known asgrain-oriented silicon steel, is used for the cores ofhigh-efficiency transformers, electric motors and generators. The state-backed China Chamber of Commerce of Metals,Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters hailed theMinistry of Commerce's April 10 ruling, which the Ministry hasnot yet publicly announced, state news agency Xinhua said. "During the investigation the Ministry found that U.S.producers had received subsidies by the U.S. government, andtheir unfair competition hurt Chinese producers," Xinhua said,quoting an unnamed person at the chamber of commerce. Carol Guthrie, a spokeswoman for the U.S. TradeRepresentative's office, said the United States was studyingthe decision and considering possible next steps, includingchallenging the measures at the World Trade Organization. "Before taking such action, we would, of course, consultfirst with the affected U.S. industry," Guthrie said inWashington. On Friday, the U.S. announced a final decision to imposestiff duties on Chinese-made oil country tubular goods, whichare steel pipe used in the oil industry [ID:nN09121864]. China has not yet formally responded to that decision,which was announced days before a trip by Chinese President HuJintao to Washington. Deputy U.S. Trade RepresentativeDemetrios Marantis is also in Beijing this week, to holdmeetings on trade with Chinese counterparts. China is encouraging its steel industry to move up thevalue chain and produce more high-tech steel, but its increasedexports of those products threaten lucrative markets forAmerican producers. China will impose anti-dumping duties of 7.8 percent on AKSteel Corp. and 19.9 percent on Allegheny Ludlum Corp., the twoAmerican producers that responded to its request forinformation. AK Steel faces anti-subsidy duties of 11.7 percentand Ludlum faces 12 percent. A spokeswoman for the Specialty Steel Industry of NorthAmerica, which accused China in an October 2008 report ofmaintaining "massive, pervasive and illegal" support forspecialty steel, said they were studying China's decision andhad no immediate comment on the move. China said Russian silicon steel producers OJSC NovolipetskSteel and VIZ-Stal Ltd face anti-dumping duties of 6.3 percent,while others face duties of 25 percent. The investigation was prompted by China's two largestsilicon steel producers: Baosteel Group, the state-owned parentof Baoshan Iron and Steel <600019.SS>, and Wuhan Iron and SteelGroup, parent of Wuhan Steel <600005.SS>. Probes into imports of U.S. grain-oriented electrical steelfocused on six issues, including subsidized electricity, gasand coal, and incentives for steel sales and funding in thestate of Pennsylvania, the ministry said last summer.[ID:nSHA169760].
