<raw><![CDATA[ * To sell from controversial Marange fields * Country has stockpile of about 4.5 million carats * Regulators to determine level of compliance  (Repeats to add PIX tag in header field) By Steven Scheer JERUSALEM, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe plans to resumeselling diamonds from its controversial Marange fields withindays, saying it fully meets the standards required by the bodythat regulates trade in conflict diamonds. Obert Moses Mpofu, Zimbabwe's minister of mines and minedevelopment, said a report that will be unveiled at this week'sKimberley Process meeting in Israel shows the African countryshould no longer be subject to industry sanctions. "We have done everything in our power to meet the minimumstandards of the Kimberley Process certification scheme," Mpofutold Reuters on the sidelines of the four-day meeting inJerusalem that began on Monday. "This puts us in a position to resume exports withoutsanctions. We will start selling diamonds again immediatelyafter the meeting," he said. Mpofu said Zimbabwe, in which 30 percent of the economycomes from minerals, has a diamond stockpile of about 4.5million carats that are due for export. "We can't continue to hold them with no reason," he said. In June, Zimbabwe's government agreed that diamonds fromMarange would only be sold under the Kimberley Process -- acertification scheme aimed at preventing the diamond trade fromfinancing violence. Marange became involved with the Kimberley Process after30,000 illegal diggers descended on the fields in 2006,prompting the government to deploy the army to stop rampantpanning and smuggling.  Rights groups accused the security forces of committingatrocities during the crackdown. Zimbabwe has accused the West of a plot to stop it frombenefitting from diamonds but it received approval for twoshipments of diamonds in July. The Marange mine -- at 66,000hectares (163,100 acres) considered the largest diamond find inthe last century -- is largely untapped, making its potentialhuge. "There is recognition that there have been markedimprovements in Marange," said Stephane Chardon, chairman of theKimberley Process working group on monitoring. "But only someparts are compliant and in other parts, less progess has beenmade." During this week's meeting, the main item on the agenda ofthe some 75 countries participating will be Zimbabwe'scompliance with the Kimberley Process. Chardon told Reuters that Zimbabwe still needs furtheraction to curb illicit trade and smuggling of diamonds. He said that by the end of the meeting, the KimberleyProcess will issue conclusions on how much more of compliance,if any, will be required from Marange. "Do we still need closer monitoring or can they exportfreely?" Chardon said. Boaz Hirsch, chairman of the Kimberley Process, said thereis agreement that Zimbabwe has implemented its rules to acertain extent but there were disputes as to whether theimplementation was 50 percent or 90 percent. In addition to Marange, Zimbabwe exports diamonds through adomestic unit of global miner Rio Tinto. The Kimberley Process was formed eight years ago andofficials believe it has succeeded in virtually ending warsfinanced by conflict diamonds. Another issue to be discussed at the meeting is how theKimberley Process can deal with human rights issues, a keydemand by its partner, Civil Society.             ]]></raw>
