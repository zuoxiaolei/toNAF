<raw><![CDATA[* Cbank cuts rates by 50 bps to 7 percent, as fcast * Says IMF-agreed steps essential for inflation, economy * Analysts see more rate cuts towards 6 pct at end-2010 * CPI risks, Greece's fiscal woes pose risk to more easing   (Adds c.bank comment, details) By Marius Zaharia and Luiza Ilie BUCHAREST, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Romania's central bank cut itsbenchmark rate by 50 basis points to 7 percent, as expected, toaid the recession-hit economy, but warned that enforcing toughmeasures agreed with the IMF was essential for recovery. The move comes after a surprise half point cut in Januaryfollowing the creation of a shaky centre-right majority cabinetthat ended a long political crisis and helped unfreeze a 20billion euro International Monetary Fund-led aid deal. With the deal back on track, Romania must now streamline itsbloated public administration, sacking as many as 100,000 stateworkers this year, and enforce painful wage and pension freezes. The measures are expected to spark nationwide strikes fromstate workers later this month, and pensioners on Wednesdaythreatened to sue the cabinet over planned freezes, but thecentral bank said the fiscal tightening was crucial. "Firm implementation of the economic policy mix ... agreedunder the external financing arrangement is essential forachieving sustainable disinflation, maintaining financialstability and restarting lasting economic recovery," it said. The bank also said monetary policy remained prudent, andnoted the European Union member's external shortfall, once itsmain vulnerability, was at sustainable levels. The leu  was little changed against the eurocompared to levels before the central bank's decision, but down0.3 percent on the day, trading at 4.0970.  FURTHER EASING Most economists polled by Reuters last week expected ahalf-point cut in interest rates  and analysts saida Fitch Ratings decision to improve Romania's outlook to stablecould provide impetus for further easing in the coming months. "The rate decisions in the first two months of the yearsuggest to us that the bank is content with the recentdevelopments on the political front and the progress made on theIMF program," Citi said in a note. "We also believe that the bank is likely to carry out itspolicy easing in a frontloaded manner to take advantage of therecent positive developments." It said it sees rates at 6.25percent at the end of the year.Romania's rates, which have gone down 325 basis points overthe past 12 months, remain the highest in the European Union,compared with Hungary's 6 percent, Poland's 3.5 percent and theCzech Republic's 1 percent. Economists say there is little chance the bank will cutrates below 6 percent this year, due to persistent inflationaryrisks from administrative prices and fuel costs. The central bank also said uncertainty in the global economyand capital flow trends weighed on the inflation outlook. Also, potential contagion throughout the region from apossible worsening of Greece's fiscal problems, which rattledmarkets last month, could hurt sentiment and prompt the centralbank to halt the easing cycle, analysts said. "Rates are at a relative low level taking the overall riskfor the economy into account and the risk of spill-over from theGreek situation could also trigger pressure on the leu," saidLars Christensen of Danske Bank in Copenhagen. The central bank also said it has scheduled a newsconference to present its quarterly inflation report on Feb. 5. (Editing by Andy Bruce)             ]]></raw>
