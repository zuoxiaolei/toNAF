<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - U.S. stock markets were up at the open on Tuesday, after official data showed that foreign purchases of U.S. securities grew at a faster rate than expected in April and as fears over Europe’s debt crisis waned.During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.86%; the S&P 500 index rose 0.89% and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.05%.Earlier Tuesday, in its monthly Treasury International Capital report, the U.S. treasury said there were USD 83.0 billion net foreign purchases of long-term securities in April, after a total of USD 140.5 billion in March.Economists had expected April's figure to come in somewhat lower, at USD 77.3 billion.Also Tuesday, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard, speaking in Hong Kong, said "My sense is that, while the sovereign debt crisis in Europe is indeed a serious matter, the global recovery at this point looks very strong and seems unlikely to be derailed". Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were also up: France’s CAC 40 was up 0.72%; Germany's DAX rose 0.64%; Britain's FTSE 100 was up 0.39%; and the EURO STOXX 50 rose 0.86%.Earlier Tuesday, Spain's Treasury raised EUR 5.2 billion at a bond auction, while Belgium raised EUR 2.5 billion and Ireland sold EUR 1.5 billion in bonds.
