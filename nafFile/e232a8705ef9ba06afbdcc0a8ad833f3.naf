<raw><![CDATA[ * Sanchez sees 600,000 jobs from more U.S. export advocacy * 1.4 million jobs would come from reducing trade barriers By Doug Palmer WASHINGTON, May 6 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's planto create 2 million new jobs by doubling exports over the nextfive years relies heavily on passing and negotiating new freetrade agreements, a top U.S. official said. Commerce Under Secretary for International Trade FranciscoSanchez, in an interview at the Reuters Latin AmericanInvestment Summit, also defended past U.S. trade dealsunpopular with many Democrats who control Congress. The Obama administration estimates it can create about600,000 trade-related jobs by getting the U.S. government,including the president himself, more involved in advocatingfor U.S. exports, Sanchez said on Wednesday. When an American company is bidding for a foreign contractworth more than $4 billion or $5 billion, the plan is for Obamato bring it up and try to help close the sale in meetings withthe purchasing country's leader, Sanchez said. Cabinet officials and ambassadors have also been told theywill be judged on how effective they are in opening doors forU.S. companies to make sales abroad, he said. But even with that increased advocacy, the Obamaadministration expects the remaining 1.4 million newtrade-related jobs to come from reducing foreign tradebarriers, and that means "going after free trade agreements,including the three that are pending," Sanchez said. Obama inherited three trade agreements with Colombia,Panama and South Korea from his predecessor, George W. Bush,who was unable to persuade the Democratic-controlled Congressto approve the pacts. Sanchez said U.S. trade officials were working to resolveDemocratic Party concerns about all three pacts. Those include anti-labor violence and impunity concerns inColombia, labor issues and bank secrecy laws in Panama and autoand beef market barriers in South Korea. Colombian Finance Minister Oscar Zuluaga told the ReutersSummit on Tuesday it would be a shame if the U.S. Congress doesnot approve the trade deal before Uribe leaves in August. "There is no reason for it. The delay is surprising,considering that Colombia is a principal ally of the UnitedStates," Zuluaga said. Sanchez, who has worked extensively in Colombia over thepast 15 years, said it would be challenging to win approval ofthe trade deal by then, but Obama knew the importance ofenacting all three pending agreements. He said U.S. trade with Chile more than doubled between2004 and 2008 after a free trade pact went into force, and thatU.S. exports to the Dominican Republic and Central Americancountries also have increased significantly since Congressapproved that controversial free trade deal in 2005. Altogether, the United States does 44 percent of its tradewith its 17 free trade partners that together represent just 10percent of global trade, Sanchez said. "So, you tell me, how do 44 percent of our global tradewith countries that represent just 10 percent of global trade?Well, it's because we've lowered barriers," Sanchez said.
