<raw><![CDATA[ * Companies cite divestment, regulatory complexities * Companies remain committed to animal health * Sanofi shares down 0.1 percent  (Adds analyst, Lilly, source on concerns, overlaps, advisers) By James Regan and Quentin Webb PARIS/LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - Regulatory pressureprompted Sanofi-Aventis and Merck & Co to abandon plans for ajoint animal health powerhouse with $5 billion in sales. The move sets back the French and U.S. drugmakers' plans toachieve economies of scale in the consolidating animal careindustry, and comes a month after they delayed the long-runningdeal's closing by another six months. It is also a blow to companies that had hoped to snap upassets with about $500 million in annual revenue that the pairwould have had to sell to clear regulatory hurdles. Merck and Sanofi said a year ago they planned to combinetheir veterinary drugs and vaccines businesses to create a jointventure with almost a third of the global market. The duo were due to merge Sanofi's pet-focused Merial unit,which they once jointly owned, with Merck's bigger,livestock-oriented Intervet business, relegating Pfizer tosecond place in the animal health industry. WestLB analyst Oliver Kaemmerer said the decision was an"unpleasant surprise" that would deprive the duo of synergiesand a likely boost to earnings. A person familiar with the matter said U.S. and Europeanregulators had taken an increasingly tough stance, partlybecause of concerns that previous sell-offs, as in Pfizer's tie-up with Wyeth, had struggled to safeguard competition. "The companies are discontinuing their agreement primarilybecause of the increasing complexity of implementing theproposed transaction," the companies said in a joint statementon Tuesday. This is "both in terms of the nature and extent of theanticipated divestitures and the length of time necessary forthe worldwide regulatory review process," they said. Both companies added that they remained committed to theiranimal health businesses, which generated annual sales of $2.6billion for Sanofi and $2.9 billion for Merck & Co in 2010. Last year Vetnosis, a consultancy, identified portfoliooverlaps in vaccines for livestock, poultry, pets and horses; inproducts to kill parasites; and in specialty veterinaryproducts, such as drugs to treat cardiovascular disorders. In October, two people familiar with the matter said thedisposals could fetch about 1.5 to 2.5 times sales -- or about$750 million to $1.25 billion.  BIDDERS Germany's Bayer AG, unlisted domestic rival BoehringerIngelheim and Switzerland's Novartis had previously made itthrough to the second round of bidding for Merck and Sanofiassets being sold as part of the venture, several sources closeto the bidders had said. Eli Lilly and Co, the sixth-biggest U.S. drugmaker by marketvalue, was also preparing a bid, people familiar with the mattersaid. Last week Lilly's Elanco unit bought Johnson & Johnson's animal health business, a deal that one person familiar withthe matter said was worth about $300 million. Further consolidation could yet come in the sector, wherePfizer is keen to grow and Novartis has not yet reached acritical size, Oddo Securities analyst Jean-Jacques Le Fur said."This leaves open the field of possibilities," he said. Shares in Sanofi were 0.1 percent lower at 47.94 euros at1051 GMT, while the French blue-chip CAC 40 index was up 0.2percent. Morgan Stanley advised on the disposals, people familiarwith the matter have said. A quartet of law firms -- Linklaters;Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton; Howrey; and Weil, Gotshal &Manges provided legal advice, the first person familiar with thematter said.
