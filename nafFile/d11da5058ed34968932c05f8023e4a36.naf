<raw><![CDATA[ By Lesley Wroughton and Emily Kaiser WASHINGTON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - If the United States isgoing to succeed in its push for more balanced global economicgrowth, it must convince China, Germany and other big exportersthere is no going back to the pre-crisis boom times. In calling for the Group of 20 to back its framework forglobal rebalancing at the Pittsburgh leaders' summit this week,the United States is asking its big trading partners to abandona strategy which paid off handsomely for years -- namely makinggoods for export to seemingly insatiable U.S. consumers. Now that the financial crisis has shown that even Americanshave their spending limits, the United States is hoping thetime is ripe to finally make some progress on an issue whichhas generated much talk but virtually no action. It is not a risk-free tactic for U.S. President BarackObama. If he expects the big exporters to change their ways, hewill have to make good on pledges to address the worsening U.S.fiscal position, which means making politically unpopularchoices about spending and taxes. "The key question here is whether the rest of the worldbelieves the United States is really going to stop being theconsumer of last resort," said Fred Bergsten, director of thePeterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Bergsten said the financial crisis gave China and other bigexporters a taste of the down side of relying on exports forgrowth. When trade collapsed, China's economy weakened eventhough its banks had largely avoided the bad assets thattriggered the global recession. The U.S. plan seeks to deliver a framework by November forrebalancing the world economy under which G20 nations wouldassess each other's policies to see if they were helpingachieve that goal. The International Monetary Fund would be at the center ofthe effort. Under the plan, the IMF would forecast the impactof policies and report back to the G20 twice a year withsuggested policy adjustments. BLAME GAME The imbalances built up at the height of the credit boom,when U.S. consumers freely tapped rising home equity and creditcards to support their spending, have long been cause forconsternation among economists. As the U.S. trade deficit swelled, correspondingly largereserves piled up in China and elsewhere. Many economists arguethat while these imbalances did not cause the crisis, theycontributed to low interest rates that in turn encouragedinvestors to chase riskier assets in hopes of fatter returns. But Beijing rejects that argument, with Chinese officialsclaiming lax regulatory oversight in rich nations was largelyto blame for the financial crisis. That is one reason why Eswar Prasad, an economics professorat Cornell University, thinks the United States will have atough time convincing China to go along with the rebalancingeffort. "They see this as an underhanded attempt by the U.S. tobring this issue back to the table in a roundabout way," saidPrasad, who travels to Asia regularly for talks with Chineseofficials. Past IMF attempts to tackle decades of U.S.over-consumption and to discourage excessive savings elsewherefailed, mostly because the IMF lacked the influence to wieldthe stick over the world's most important economies. CARROTS AND STICKS Washington is hoping carrots work better, and thinkselevating an issue that had been handled by finance ministersto the leaders level will prove more effective. The Obama administration has struck a conciliatory tone inits dealings with Beijing, and has been fairly quiet over thethorny issue of China's currency policy. For years, Washingtonhas pressed Beijing to let its yuan currency rise in value tomove China's economy away from its reliance on exports. The IMF launched a multilateral consultation process withthe United States, Japan, China, Saudi Arabia and the euro areain 2006 to try and address the distortions of economic growthin the world but got little further than a pledge by countriesto tackle trade and investment imbalances. To strengthen the IMF's hand this time, the United Statesis pushing for an agreement at this week's G20 meeting toincrease the voting power of large emerging market countries togive them more say in IMF decisions. Domenico Lombardi, president of the Oxford Institute forEconomic Policy, said by giving emerging economies more powerat the IMF, countries like China would be recognized for theirinput in the world economy. "The U.S. is pursuing a multi-pronged strategy whereby onthe one hand they're asking China to become a more responsibleplayer in the international monetary system by assumingcommitments." "On the other hand, the U.S. is willing to support any movein the reform of the IMF that would give China a higher role,"said Lombardi, who is also a senior fellow at the BrookingsInstitute in Washington.
