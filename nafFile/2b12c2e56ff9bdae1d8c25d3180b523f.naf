<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – Last week saw the euro slump to a 2-week low against the U.S. dollar on Friday, after a five notch downgrade of Ireland’s sovereign debt by ratings agency Moody’s and after the International Monetary Fund warned of a "significant" contagion threat from Ireland.EUR/USD hit 1.3132 on Friday, the pair’s lowest since December 2; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3186 by close of trade, shedding just 0.07% over the week.The pair is likely to find short-term support at 1.3132, Friday’s low and resistance at 1.3358, Friday’s high.In a report on the government's request for a three-year loan of EUR22.5 billion from the IMF, its economists also said that a "disorderly eruption" of financial pressures in Ireland would have damaging consequences for Spain, Greece, Portugal and could even affect the U.S. and the U.K. The IMF warnings followed news that Moody's downgraded Ireland's sovereign debt to Baa1 from Aa2. The report saw the single currency erase modest gains made after data showed that Germany's Ifo index of business climate  rose to 109.9 in December, the highest level since Germany's reunification.Meanwhile, official data showed that U.S. retail sales, producer prices and industrial production rose more-than-expected in November, while manufacturing in the Philadelphia region expanded in December at the fastest pace since April 2005.Also last week, the Federal Reserve left the size of its bond-purchase program unchanged, saying the purchases will “promote a stronger pace of economic recovery.” The central bank also left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at zero to 0.25% where it has been since December 2008. In the week ahead, concerns over the euro zone sovereign debt crisis are likely to continue to weigh on the single currency, while the U.S. is to release a slew of data, including reports on durable goods orders and personal income and consumption.Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.Monday, December 20In the euro zone, Germany is to publish official data on producer price inflation, a leading indicator of consumer inflation.
