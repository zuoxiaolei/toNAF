<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds details, background, Chinese Commerce Ministry) BRUSSELS, April 9 (Reuters) - The European Commission onFriday rejected a complaint by China to the World TradeOrganisation that the EU executive's anti-dumping tariffs onimports of certain Chinese-made shoes breached WTO rules. Beijing has formally requested that the global tradewatchdog set up a dispute panel to rule on the legality of theCommission's decision in 2006 to impose duties of up to 16.5percent on shoe imports from China.  "The European Commission strongly rejects China's claim madetoday that the EU's anti-dumping measures against certainfootwear from China are not in line with the EU's WTOobligations," Commission spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said. The Commission, executive arm of the EU, imposed the dutieson Chinese and Vietnamese shoes following a complaint byEuropean manufacturers who argued that they were unable tocompete with low-cost producers from the two countries. China had sought a formal consultation with the WTO over thedispute in February, after ministers from the 27-country EUdecided to extend the duties by 15 months in December last year. Such consultations are a first step in the world tradebody's dispute-settlement process. The move failed to tackleChina's concerns, prompting the request for a panel.  "It doesn't matter if they reject the request this time, wewill get the panel automatically next time," an official fromthe Chinese Ministry of Commerce said. WTO rules allow a panel to be convened upon the secondrequest, though the defendant may block the first request.
