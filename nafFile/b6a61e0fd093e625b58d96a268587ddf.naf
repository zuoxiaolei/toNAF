<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar extended losses against the yen for a second day on Wednesday, but was higher against the other major currencies as concerns over the outlook for global growth bolstered safe haven demand.During European morning trade, the dollar was sharply lower against the yen, with USD/JPY dropping 1.02% to 87.86.The yen remained stronger after Japan’s economy minister warned Tuesday that a weak yen could have a negative impact on the economy.The rebound comes after the yen hit two-and-a-half-year lows against the dollar in recent sessions, amid mounting political pressure on the Bank of Japan to implement more aggressive easing measures at its policy meeting next week.The greenback was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD down 0.20% to 1.3277.The euro came under pressure after Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the euro group of finance ministers, said Tuesday that the euro’s value was “dangerously high” and posed a threat to the recovery in the euro zone.Meanwhile, safe haven demand was supported after the World Bank cut its forecast for global growth to 2.4% this year from 3% in June and warned that developing nations would struggle in 2013.The greenback pushed higher against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.29% to 1.6017.The greenback was lower against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF slipping 0.22% to 0.9298. The Swiss franc was little changed after official data showed that retail sales in Switzerland rose by an annualized 2.9% in November, missing expectations for a 3.2% gain.The greenback was broadly higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD adding 0.22% to trade at 0.9862, AUD/USD down 0.23% to 1.0539 and NZD/USD losing 0.26% to trade at 0.8375.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, edged up 0.09% to 79.84.Later Wednesday both the euro zone and the U.S. were to release official data on consumer inflation, while Germany was to hold an auction of 10-year government bonds.             ]]></raw>
