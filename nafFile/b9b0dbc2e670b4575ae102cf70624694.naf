<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The New Zealand dollar ended the week at the highest level in nearly 15-month against its U.S. counterpart on Friday, as the release of soft U.S. inflation data warranted continued monetary easing by the Federal Reserve.NZD/USD hit 0.8475 on Friday, the pair’s highest since September 5, 2011; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.8460 by close of trade, 1.64% higher for the week.The pair is likely to find support at 0.8420, Thursday’s low and near-term resistance at 0.8475, Friday’s high.The Department of Labor said Friday U.S. consumer inflation fell 0.3% in November, down for the first time in six months on the back of lower gasoline prices, bringing the annualized rate of inflation to 1.8%.The soft inflation data warranted continued monetary easing by the Federal Reserve.The U.S. central bank said Wednesday it would continue to purchase USD85 billion a month of government bonds and mortgage based securities in order to shore up the economic recovery.The Fed also said interest rates would remain close to zero as long as inflation forecasts remain near the bank’s 2% target and until the U.S. unemployment rate declines to 6.5% or less.The kiwi drew additional support from data showing Chinese manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in more than a year in December. China’s preliminary HSBC manufacturing PMI rose to 50.9, up from a final reading of 50.5 in November.The upbeat data helped eased concerns over the growth outlook for the world’s second largest economy. Meanwhile, investors continued to monitor developments surrounding the fiscal cliff in the U.S., approximately USD600 billion in automatic tax hikes and spending cuts due to come into effect on January 1, unless a divided Congress and the White House can work out a compromise in the two weeks left before the deadline.President Barack Obama said recently that any solution must include spending cuts and raising revenue, including increasing taxes on the wealthiest. Republican leaders say they will agree to higher revenue, but they want to close loopholes or reduce tax breaks rather than raise rates.Without a deal, the U.S. could fall back into recession and drag much of the world down with it.In the coming week, investors will be continuing to monitor the progress of talks in Washington on the fiscal cliff.
