[ID:nTKC003469] China shares also rallied, with Shanghai stocks jumpingmore than 2 percent, as a senior Chinese government economistsaid China's economy may regain double-digit annual growth inthe fourth quarter. Stronger-than-expected growth though couldalso bring monetary tightening closer to the horizon.[ID:nPEK368397] Upbeat U.S. industrial output data on Wednesday raisedhopes that the pace of the global economic recovery wasaccelerating and kept up pressure on the U.S. dollar asinvestors sought out riskier assets and higher-yieldingcurrencies.

RATE TENSION The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks traded outside Japan was up 1.3 percent by mid-afternoon, itshighest level since August last year. In South Korea, authorities were spotted intervening for asecond day after the won  hit an 11-month high at1,204.9. Analysts say South Korea could be the first G20 country totighten monetary policy, and strong sales reports from thecountry's top three department stores were a further sign thatAsia's fourth-largest economy is picking up. However, the Finance Ministry and the central bank offereddiffering views on how to manage the economy, underliningtension over the timing of an interest rate rise.[ID:nSEO170410] That took some steam out of the stock market and the KOSPIindex  ended up 0.7 percent. Korean December treasurybond futures  meanwhile turned slightly higher after theMinistry of Finance reaffirmed its opposition to an early exitfrom economic stimulus and warned that the economy faced highuncertainty. "The finance minister's comments gave some relief to debtinvestors while the waning strength in stock markets alsohelped," said Kim Dong-whan at HI Investment & Securities.
