<raw><![CDATA[ * Basel III costs manageable, benefits substantial -FSB * GDP drops 0.2 pct in 4-yr phase-in for 1 pct more capital * GDP loss higher in 2-yr phase-in, little change if longer  (Adds detail from Basel, FSB statement) VIENNA, Aug 18 (Reuters) - New rules for banks' capital andliquidity will have only a modest impact on economic outputwhile they are phased in, but result in substantial long-termbenefits, the groups charged with drafting the rules said. The new "Basel III" rules will tighten lending and reduceinvestment during a transition period to a much lower degreethan forecast by banks, the Basel Committee for BankingSupervision and the Financial Stability Board said on Wednesday. But they will make financial crises and the output lossesthey cause much less likely and this outweighs the transitionaloutput loss during the few years in which they are phased in,the two bodies said in a statements. "The analysis shows that the macroeconomic costs ofimplementing stronger standards are manageable, ... while thelonger-term benefits to financial stability and more stableeconomic growth are substantial," FSB Chairman Mario Draghi saidin the statement. The FSB said its analysis showed that for each percentagepoint rise in the ratio of tangible common equity torisk-weighted assets over four years, global gross domesticproduct would decline by 0.2 percent. Basel III will likely demand banks have a core Tier 1capital -- roughly equivalent to tangible common equity -- ratioof 4-6 percent, sources told Reuters last week. The FSB analysis is based on the rise in actual capitallevels. Banks are typically holding much more capital than theregulatory minimum.The only other comparable assessment of the economic impactof Basel III to date was published by bank lobby group Instituteof International Finance (IIF) in June. The IIF said proposed regulatory measures -- also includingbank levy plans -- would cut 3 percent off economic growth overthe next five years in the United States, euro zone and Japan,and cost almost 10 million jobs.
