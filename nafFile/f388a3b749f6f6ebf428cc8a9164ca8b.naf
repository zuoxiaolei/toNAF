<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar looks vulnerable against yen, near 15-yr low * Euro near three-week highs vs dollar * Risk currencies supported by U.S. payrolls data  (updates prices, adds quote) By Anirban Nag LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The dollar dipped on Monday andlooked set to test a 15-year low against the yen after sheddinggains made after U.S. jobs data, while better risk appetite keptthe euro near a three-week high versus the U.S. currency. Less-dire-than-expected U.S. payrolls data last week easedmarket anxiety over chances of a global slowdown and boosteddemand for growth-linked currencies like the Australian dollar. "We are seeing some relief from fears about a double-diprecession in the U.S. helping risk sentiment and the euro," saidGareth Berry, currency strategist at UBS. "But whether thissentiment can be sustained or not is difficult to say." U.S. non-farm payrolls fell 54,000, a much smaller drop thanthe predicted 100,000. Private employment, considered a bettergauge of labour market health, increased 67,000. Rising risk appetite has tended to help the euro and higher-yielding currencies in recent months, as investors increasinglysee the dollar as a funding currency for investments onexpectations of a prolonged period of near zero U.S. rates. The euro was at flat for the day at $1.2890, having earlierrisen to $1.2918, its highest since Aug. 12. Resistance is seenaround $1.2932, the Aug. 12 high. Market participants said they believed Asian central banks,excluding Japan, are converting dollars into euros after theyintervene to rein in gains in their own currencies against thegreenback, further boosting the euro. The dollar index was down 0.1 percent at 82.02 with supportat 81.82 -- the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the index'srise from 80.085 to a high of 83.559, in August.  YEN LONG POSITIONS TRIMMED The dollar also ceded ground against the yen, dropping 0.25percent to 84.07 yen, not far from last month's 15-year low of83.58. It had risen to 85.23 after the jobs data, but quicklyerased the gains. Dollar/yen has been very highly correlated with U.S. bondyields in recent months. The lower U.S. yields are, the cheaperthe dollar is against the yen, as lower yields tend todiscourage investment in the dollar from Japan. In the past month, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S.Treasury note has shed 12 basis points, while the dollar/yen hasfallen over 1.5 percent during the same period. Investors have also bought yen in the past few months as theytend to favour currencies of countries with a current accountsurplus when they want to avoid risk. The rise had causedheadaches for Japanese policymakers battling deflation at homeand counting on exports to jump-start the economy. Speculators trimmed their long positions on the yen lastweek but still have big yen long positions, data from the U.S.Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed on Friday. Net longpositions were cut to 49,904 from 51,069 contracts.    Berry at UBS said hedge funds were selling dollar/yenwhile other asset managers were emerging as bit buyers. He addedhedge funds believed U.S. data would remain soft, puttingdownward pressure on U.S. yields and dollar/yen. On Saturday, Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda saidTokyo would take decisive steps to stem the yen's rise whenneeded while suggesting coordinated currency intervention in themarket was a difficult option.. "For intervention to work, it has to be coordinated and itdoes not look that the U.S. is prepared for that," said BilalHafeez, foreign exchange strategist at Deutsche Bank.  "So going solo by the Japanese authorities could work for aday, but unlikely beyond that. We are looking for the dollar/yento fall to 80 yen in the medium term."             ]]></raw>
