<raw><![CDATA[   * Agrium expected to trump GrainCorp's rival AWB bid * Offer depends on due diligence, regulatory approval * Agrium shares down 1.3 percent; AWB shares surge 30 pct (Adds analyst comments, retail map graphic, background, shareprice move; in U.S. dollars unless noted) By Michael Smith SYDNEY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canadian fertilizer maker AgriumInc  offered $1.1 billion for Australia's AWB ,trumping a rival bid from local player GrainCorp , asit seeks to expand its global retail operations. The battle for AWB, Australia's largest wheat exporter,marks the latest round of consolidation in the country's grainindustry as offshore players scramble for a larger slice of theaction in the world's fourth-largest wheat exporting nation. Australia's wheat industry is counting on a bumper cropthis year, while suppliers in Europe and Russia struggle withdrought and poor production that have helped push wheat pricesto a two-year high this month. Industry sources said other big global competitors likeCanadian grain handler Viterra  and U.S. commoditiesfirm Gavil Group have also looked at AWB, which lost itsmonopoly over Australia's bulk wheat exports two years ago. Still, the weekend's all-cash bid by Agrium, the largestagricultural products retailer in North America, with a marketcapitalization of $10.5 billion, came as surprise and sent AWBshares soaring more than 30 percent on Monday. "The acquisition should be accretive and is consistent withAgrium's growth strategy," RBC Capital Markets analyst Fai Leesaid in a note to clients. "While we would have preferred to see a lower proposedprice or acquisition closer to North America, our initialassessment of the announcement is positive," said Lee. Shares of Agrium opened lower on the Toronto Stock Exchangeon Monday and were down 1.3 percent at C$69.18 at midday. AWBshares closed 29.7 percent higher at A$1.42, just below theA$1.50 a share offer. Tom Elliot, managing director at MM&E Capital, noted thatalthough GrainCorp may come in with a counter-bid, its stockprice indicates that shareholders are not keen to enter into abidding war. GrainCorp shares jumped more than 6 percent to touch anine-month high, indicating that investors felt it was unlikelythat GrainCorp could come back with a higher offer. The sharesfinished up 4.2 percent at A$6.53. Investors said Agrium's offer, a 37 percent premium toAWB's Friday closing price, was expected to beat outGrainCorp's lower all-share bid made last month. The latest offer values AWB at A$1.2 billion, according toReuters calculations, a premium to GrainCorp's all-share deal,worth around A$921 million, based on both companies' shareprices at 0200 GMT. Sources close to the deal said AWB would consider bothoffers but the Agrium offer looked like a "no-brainer". "We would not be surprised if there were additional bids orif other companies joined the fray. Specifically, in our view,there is the potential for Viterra to enter the process, givenpotential synergies," UBS analyst Brian MacArthur said in anote to clients. Viterra acquired Australia's ABB Grain Ltd in a $1.4billion deal last September, making it one of the world'slargest grain handlers. Viterra declined to comment onspeculation that it could launch a rival bid for AWB. Shares in other Australian agribusiness firms rose onspeculation of further mergers and acquisitions in the sector,with shares in Elders Ltd  jumping around 12 percent.

Agrium's retail network in North America is roughly threetimes larger than the second-largest player and its retail unitalone boasted sales of more than $6 billion in 2009. It alsoowns retail outlets in Argentina and has been expanding itsretail presence in Uruguay and Chile. Earlier this year, Agrium bowed out of a hostile bid forU.S. rival CF Industries  after CF scuppered any hope ofa deal when it clinched an agreement to buy rival TerraIndustries. [ID:nN12157160] GLOBAL PARTNER AWB has long been seeking to partner with a global playerafter losing its monopoly over Australia's bulk wheat exportstwo years ago, when the government abolished the single-desksystem that the former Australia Wheat Board operated. Analysts say it needs to bulk up to compete with big globalcompetitors like Bunge Ltd , Cargill and Glencore, andhas been shrinking ever since it lost its exporting monopoly.That followed a judicial inquiry that found the firm had paidkickbacks to the former Iraq government of Saddam Hussein tosecure wheat sales. Agrium's offer remains conditional on due diligence,foreign investment approvals and removal of a 10 percentshareholder cap under AWB's constitution. AWB said it would continue to look at GrainCorp's bid,alongside the new offer. Last month's offer from GrainCorp tookthe market by surprise as AWB had been tipped to team up withan overseas player. Under the earlier recommended GrainCorp offer, AWBshareholders would get one GrainCorp share for every 5.75 AWBshares, valuing each share at A$1.047.
