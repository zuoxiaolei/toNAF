<raw><![CDATA[ DUBAI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates economywill see strong economic growth in 2010, recovering from acontraction in 2009, boosted by an expected rally in oilprices, the central bank governor was quoted as saying onSunday. The UAE's economy was solid and "oil prices rising againwill support expected economic growth next year", Sultan Nasseral-Suweidi told Al Ittihad newspaper. Weaker oil prices will affect growth and lead to acontraction in the UAE economy in 2009, he added, withoutgiving a figure. The Gulf region has been hard-hit by a drop in oil pricesto just above $32 per barrel in December after prices peaked atnearly $150 a barrel in mid-2008. Suweidi said he expected oil prices to decline 30 percentin 2009 compared to 2008, adding he estimated the average priceof a barrel of oil in 2009 to reach between $60 to $63. The price of crude has averaged at around $54.67 per barrelso far this year, down from an average of $99.75 in 2008. "It is natural for UAE gross domestic product to decline inview of these factors," he said. Suweidi reiterated the dirham would remain pegged to theU.S. dollar despite fluctuations in the currency. "The UAE has significant foreign investments and the dollarremains an important currency," he told the paper.  (Reporting by Tamara Walid; Editing by Bill Tarrant)             ]]></raw>
