<raw><![CDATA[  * US ISM manufacturing report spurs dollar short-covering * Dollar falls back vs yen after earlier spike * Euro down vs dollar, euro/sterling weighs(Recasts lead, adds quote, U.S. data, updates prices)  By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss  NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The dollar firmed against theeuro and yen on Monday after stronger-than-expected U.S.manufacturing data, though gains were fleeting as marketsbraced for more monetary easing from the Federal Reserve thisweek. The Fed is likely to announce on Wednesday a fresh round ofquantitative easing under which the U.S. central bank would buybonds and essentially flood the economy with dollars in anattempt to revitalize it. That should push Treasury yieldslower and diminish the allure of some U.S. assets, forcinginvestors to seek higher returns elsewhere. An above-forecast October reading of U.S. manufacturingconditions from the Institute for Supply Management on Mondaydid nothing to significantly change the market's view on theexpected easing. Most economists expect the Fed to buy $80 billion to $100billion in assets per month, according to a Reuters poll.Estimates of total purchases ranged from $250 billion to $2trillion. "The dollar is starting to rebound a little bit off thebetter-than-expected ISM data. But we're still within theranges we have seen the last couple of days," said GregMichalowski, chief currency analyst at the New York-basedonline broker FXDD. "I think the market was expecting a weaker ISM to keep thedollar on the defensive going into all the events this week.But the data came in strong so traders were forced to coversome of their short positions." Japanese intervention fears came to the fore again onMonday after a spike in the dollar versus the yen following thepair's fall to a fresh 15-year low. That further addeduncertainty to a market already jittery about Wednesday's Feddecision, although trades were confined to a narrow pricerange. In midday trading, the dollar was up less than 0.1 percentagainst a basket of six currencies at 77.285. DOLLAR PULLBACK? Some analysts said dollar short positions have becomeoverstretched as investors priced in aggressive Fed easing,leaving scope for a pullback in the dollar if the Fed announcesa smaller round of purchases. "The dollar is clearly oversold, and it's possible we couldsee a rally in the dollar index maybe up to 79 or 80. But it'spretty clear that we want a lower dollar to help our exports,"said Tom Samuelson, chief investment officer at AdvancedEquities Asset Management in Scottsdale, Arizona. The firm, a global asset allocation company, has assetsunder management of $740 million, investing as well in fixedincome and commodities. Analysts said the market remained fairly short dollarsheading into the Fed meeting but short-term players havelightened some positions, latest CFTC data showed. There are also significant events this week, leaving mostinvestors sidelined, traders said. As well as the Fed, thereare four other major policy decisions this week -- inAustralia, the euro zone, UK and Japan -- with key U.S. jobsdata due Friday. The euro was down 0.5 percent at $1.3879 after climbing to$1.4012 overnight. The euro was also weighed down by gains in the pound,traders said, after UK data showed an above-consensusmanufacturing index. The recent strength in UK data, includinga stronger-than-expected gross domestic product reading for thethird quarter, has pushed out expectations the Bank of Englandwill engage in quantitative easing. The euro was down 0.4 percent at 0.8660. The dollar rose 0.4 percent to 80.68 yen, mostly on the ISMdata. It earlier spiked more than one yen to 81.60 yen in Asiantrade. The Australian dollar was up 0.3 percent at US$0.9865,buoyed by strong data from China, the biggest buyer ofAustralian commodities.. Australia's central bank is expected to leave rates on holdon Tuesday following recent below-forecast inflation data, butthere is a risk of a 25 basis-point hike.             ]]></raw>
