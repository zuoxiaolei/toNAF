<raw><![CDATA[ * March crude imports down 6.6 pct on year * Three refineries still shut * Power saving plans in summer to curb oil demand * March LNG imports down 0.6 pct, thermal coal up 18.5 pct (Adds detail, comment)	 By Risa Maeda	 TOKYO, April 20 (Reuters) - Japan's imports of crude fell attheir fastest pace in more than a year in March after themassive earthquake damaged refineries and closed ports, but werelikely to bounce back in April as delayed cargoes unloaded.	 "They were not able to discharge a lot of crude aseverything was shut down," a regional crude trader said,referring to the ports and refineries affected by theearthquake. "Imports are going to rise in April from March."	 Crude demand in the world's third-largest oil consumerbeyond April would depend on how quickly diesel demand picks upfor reconstruction and how much crude is used in direct burningat power plants. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecastdirect burning could rise to 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) inthe peak demand summer months.	 The outlook for oil demand is unclear as the nation tries tocope with damaged supply chains and  the impact of lostpower capacity and the nuclear crisis on business and consumeractivity.	 With little clarity on when factory output and supply chainwill be fully restored, Japanese corporate confidence plunged bya record amount in April, a Reuters poll showed. [ID:nL3E7FD3IS]	 A magnitude 9.0 quake and subsequent tsunami on March 11devastated the northeast of the country, damaging ports,refineries and power plants.	 Although many of the facilities have resumed operations,quake-affected utilities may be short of power capacityequivalent to as much as 24 percent of normal power demand during peak times this summer, the government has estimated. 	 "For example, companies could implement irregular shifts andother measures to save power during the summer," said TakayoshiKitada, head of Mitsubishi Research Institute's industrialstrategy consulting group. "Together with the continueddisruption in supply chains, that would curb oil demand." 	 But Kitada added that if utilities boost oil-firedgeneration as well as gas-fired power, oil imports couldprobably come close to year-ago levels.	 Also, if oil product margins stay high, some ofthe undamaged refineries could take in more oil to produceproducts for export. Japan has already resumed shipping oilproducts to Asia. [ID:nL3E7FJ0OL]	 The reconstruction of devastated areas in the Tohoku regionwas unlikely to boost demand until January, Kitada said.	 Still, estimates vary on how the quake will impact demandthis year, and when diesel demand will rise for reconstruction.In its monthly oil market report this month, the IEA forecastincreased demand could kick in earlier, and has revised itsestimate for Japanese demand upward by 150,000 bpd for 2011 fromits pre-quake estimate.	  MARCH IMPORTS	 In March, the volume of Japan's customs-cleared crude oilimports slid 6.6 percent from a year earlier to 17.776 millionkilolitres (3.61 million barrels per day), preliminary datashowed. [ID:nL3E7FK02J]	 That was the sharpest decline since an 18.4 percent drop inOctober 2009. In February, Japan's crude oil imports rose 5.6percent from a year earlier to 18.872 million kl.	Three quake-damaged refineries remain shut. TheKashima refinery operated by JX Holdings is slated torestart by summer and JX's Sendai refinery is scheduled torestart by summer 2012. But Cosmo Oil Co has not saidwhen it will be able to restart its Chiba refinery.	 Five thermal power plants and four nuclear plants which wereshut after the quake remain closed.	  LNG IMPORTS DOWN, COAL UP	 Imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) fell 0.6 percent to6.674 million tonnes last month, the first drop since December,when imports declined 3.0 percent. They had risen 3.8 percent inFebruary.	 Several utilities have given Tokyo Electric some of theirLNG cargoes to help it make up for lost power, forcing them touse more non-LNG fuel. [ID:nL3E7ES03H]	 But given Qatar's decision to send an additional 4million tonnes of LNG to Japan over the next year, utilities mayprefer to use the low carbon fuel to oil or coal.[ID:nL3E7FJ1AI]	 Imports of thermal coal for power generation last monthposted their steepest year-on-year increase since May 2010,rising 18.5 percent to 8.815 million tonnes.	 Japan's thermal coal imports have risen for the 12th monthin a row.	 The Japan crude cocktail (JCC) price, or the average pricefor customs-cleared crude oil imports, which is used as thebenchmark for LNG prices for Japanese buyers, rose to $103.01 abarrel in March.	 That was the highest price since September 2008, when theprice stood at $120.65 a barrel. The price for February wasrevised to $95.91.
