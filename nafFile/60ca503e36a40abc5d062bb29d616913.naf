<raw><![CDATA[ * Markets expect new round of central bank action * Asian stocks jump after U.S. gains * Dollar falls as investors anticipate Fed easing steps * Gold at new record, silver hits 30-year peak By Alex Richardson SINGAPORE, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Stocks, metals and Japanesegovernment debt rose on Wednesday and the dollar fell afterfresh monetary easing moves by the Bank of Japan spurredexpectations of a new round of central bank action to boostailing economies. Tuesday's unexpectedly bold action by the BOJ -- which cutinterest rates close to zero and said it would pump cash intothe financial system through asset purchases -- was seen as thefirst salvo in a reflationary splurge by policymakers in Japan,the United States and Britain. Global markets are now preoccupied with the likelihood thatthe Federal Reserve will make a new sortie into "quantitiveeasing" -- effectively printing money to buy assets -- nextmonth, an expectation that pushed the dollar down broadly. The weakening dollar drove traditional safe haven gold tothe latest in a series of record highs and silver to a 30-yearpeak, while hopes that monetary stimulus while boost industrialdemand sent copper to its highest level in more than two years. But ultra-low interest rates and monetary easing in therich world has ignited fears of "beggar-thy-neighbour" currencywars, with International Monetary Fund chief DominiqueStrauss-Kahn warning that countries risk undermining the globalrecovery if they use their currencies to try and boost domesticgrowth. "There is clearly the idea beginning to circulate thatcurrencies can be used as a policy weapon," Strauss-Kahn saidin comments published in the Financial Times on Wednesday.[nLDE6942A2] Trade weighted exchange rates:  http://r.reuters.com/qun86p Global interest rates:       http://link.reuters.com/wed86p BOJ policy rate:             http://link.reuters.com/syz76p Yen - taking on the market:     http://r.reuters.com/fac44p The BOJ's decision to buy a broad range of assets,including real estate investment trusts and exchange tradedfunds, lifted the Nikkei share average  1.3 percent,although a strong yen -- now not far from the level thatprompted the authorities to intervene to weaken it last month-- capped gains. [.T] "The most important focus seems to have been aimed atcurrencies but the yen hasn't weakened against the dollar, andthat's keeping a lid on further stock gains," said MitsushigeAkino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment ManagementCo. "Rather, the yen is staying on the strong side due toexpectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve might announce alarger-scale easing." Hopes of further stimulus from the Fed pushed U.S. stocksto a near 5-month high on Tuesday, with the S&P 500  up2.1 percent, and the exuberance continued in Asia. [.N] MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.4 percent, led by the materials andenergy sectors  . "Commodities are all looking pretty fabulous at the moment.Everyone's happy," said Martin Angel, a dealer at PatersonsSecurities in resource-rich Australia, where the benchmarkindex  rose 1.5 percent. [.AX] Spot gold  hit a new record at $1,344.10 an ounce andsilver  touched a 30-year peak at $20.95 an ounce. LondonMetal Exchange three-month copper  rose to $8,244 atonne, its highest since July 2008. [GOL/] [MET/L] But oil slipped back from a 5-month high after an industryreport showed U.S. crude stockpiles jumped more than expectedlast week. U.S. crude futures  fell 28 cents to $82.54 abarrel. [O/R] The dollar stood at 83.15 yen , well down from itspost-BOJ high of 83.99 and less than half a yen away from its15-year low of 82.87 yen set in mid-September shortly beforeJapan stepped in to weaken a currency whose strength washammering the export sector on which its economy is built. "The low of 15 September has become an important supportlevel. A successful move lower could well trigger a new wave ofyen buying as the market search for the next line in the sand,"said Matthew Strauss, a senior FX strategist RBC CapitalMarkets, in a client note. The euro was steady at $1.3825 , having hit an8-month high of $1.3860 on Tuesday helped by buying by Asiancentral banks, traders said.
