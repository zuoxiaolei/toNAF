<raw><![CDATA[Aussie loses ground vs. greenback after IMF cuts forecastInvesting.com - The Australian dollar declined against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, as risk sentiment remained under pressure after the International Monetary Fund cut on Tuesday its forecast for global economic growth this year.AUD/USD hit 0.8752 during late Asian trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.8778, down 0.41%.The pair was likely to find support at 0.8649, the low of October 6 and resistance at 0.8888, the high of September 25.Market sentiment was hit after the IMF downgraded its global growth forecast for both this year and next, due to stagnation in Europe and a weaker-than-forecast recovery in Japan.The agency now sees 2014 global growth of 3.3% and 2015 growth of 3.8%, a decline of 0.1% for 2014 and 0.2% for 2015 from forecasts made in July.Investors were turning their attention to the minutes of the Federal Reserveâ€™s September meeting, due out later in the day, for fresh indications on the future possible direction of U.S. monetary policy.The Aussie was also lower against the euro, with EUR/AUD edging up 0.08% to 1.4384.             ]]></raw>
