<raw><![CDATA[ * Canadian dollar gains more than 1 U.S. cent * Rises as high as C$1.0406/US$, or 96.10 U.S. cents * Higher oil, metal prices boost currency * Bonds mostly higher (Adds details) By Ka Yan Ng TORONTO, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar reached asix-week high against the U.S. currency on Tuesday as the priceof key commodities rose and investor thirst for risk climbedalong with global equities as worries over Dubai's debt waned. Jitters about Dubai's debt subsided after stateconglomerate Dubai World, the center of the debt storm, saidits planned restructuring of some units involved a lower thanexpected $26 billion in debt. "Given that it's considerably lower than what the marketwas expecting, we saw a nice rebound in terms of risk-seekingbehavior," said George Davis, chief technical analyst at RBCCapital Markets. "With the (U.S.) dollar generally trading to the weakerside of the ledger against all the major currencies, except theyen, we've seen some continued downside follow-through downtowards the C$1.04 area," said Davis. The currency rose as high as C$1.0406 to the U.S. dollar,or 96.10 U.S. cents, its highest level since Oct. 21, as globalstocks were sharply higher, and gold hit a record above $1,200an ounce. The price of oil, a key Canadian export, was alsoholding above $78 a barrel. [MKTS/GLOB] [GOL/] [O/R] An interest rate hike in Australia also sharpened riskappetite.  [ID:nSYD393465] At 12:20 p.m. (1720 GMT), the Canadian dollar was atC$1.0435 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.83 U.S cents, up fromC$1.0556 to the U.S. dollar, or 94.73 U.S. cents, on Monday. The move higher on Tuesday extends gains made in theprevious session after numbers showed Canada officially exitedrecession. [ID:nN30349047] Although the currency is on a run higher, Canada isunlikely to have to take special measures to curb the rise,such as those taken on the yen by Japan, Finance Minister JimFlaherty said on Tuesday. [ID:N01499613] The Bank of Japan announced more measures to ease monetarypolicy to help the ailing economy following an emergencymeeting, while holding interest rates at 0.1 percent.[ID:nTKZ006325] BONDS TURN HIGHER Canadian bond prices were higher across most of the curve,reversing early losses, as the U.S. manufacturing sector grewfor the fourth straight month in November, but at at a slowerpace. Data from the Institute for Supply Management reinforcedquestions about the strength of the U.S. recovery, althoughgains in U.S. stocks and signs of a stabilizing housing marketlimited gains in debt markets.
