<raw><![CDATA[ * Costs of leaving euro far outweigh any benefits * Political impact on EU would be devastating * Economic damage on all sides would be severe * Germany has no interest in any country leaving euro By Paul Taylor PARIS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Unlike true love, the euro reallyis forever. That may seem a reckless notion to advance just as Irelandbecomes the second highly indebted member of the 16-nationsingle currency area to require a bailout, following Greece, andas bond markets close in on Portugal and Spain. But the cost to any country of leaving the euro zone wouldbe so high, and the damage that an exit would inflict on thecurrency and the remaining members so great, that no governmentwould rationally choose to secede, or to push another out. Argentina's 2001-2002 economic crisis and $100 billion bonddefault, which reduced millions of people to poverty, would palein comparison with the likely chain reaction across Europe. "There would be chain bankruptcies. A run on the banks wouldbe certain. It would be far worse than Argentina," said JeanPisani-Ferry, director of the Brussels economic think-tankBruegel. The "costs of the non-euro", as they are sometimes called byBrussels insiders, would be multiple: political, economic,social, reputational and strategic. The common currency launched in 1999 is the apex of half acentury of European integration. Even a partial breakup would bea momentous setback for the European Union, including for the 11member states that have not, or not yet, joined the euro. The 27-nation EU, which struggles to make its voice heard ina world where emerging powers are challenging U.S.-led Westernhegemony, would suffer a devastating loss of prestige. It is hard to imagine the EU's single market in goods,services, capital and labour -- the foundation stone of Europeanprosperity -- remaining intact if countries quit the euro, triggering disorderly devaluations and chaotic financial flows. The exit of a state such as Greece, Ireland or Portugal, orthe imagined departure of economic giant Germany, would causeimmense bitterness and could revive national conflicts thatEuropean unification was meant to bury forever. Germany, which sells more than 50 percent of its exports tothe euro zone, would lose vital markets and likely end up with aovervalued currency that would impede its international economiccompetitiveness. "The political consequences would be dreadful. There wouldbe almighty recriminations. A country that left the euro wouldno longer be friends with the others," Pisani-Ferry said. U.S. economist Barry Eichengreen, who authored a classic2007 paper arguing that the single currency could not be undone,reaffirmed that belief in the midst of the Greek crisis. "Adopting the euro is effectively irreversible," he wrote inan article on the economics website Vox. "Leaving would require lengthy preparations, which, giventhe anticipated devaluation, would trigger the mother of allfinancial crises," said Eichengreen, a professor at theUniversity of California, Berkeley. Households and companies would shift deposits to other eurozone banks or countries to protect their savings, starting asystem-wide run on banks, capital outflows and asset sell-offs. Fleeing investors would create a bond market stampede.  Since foreign debt would still be denominated in euros, aseceding state would almost automatically default, causing acutesolvency problems not only for its own banks but for banksacross Europe. It might be shut out of international capitalmarkets for years and have to balance its budget immediately. Domestic debts would either be converted to a devaluednational currency, inflicting severe losses on creditors, orrepayable in euros, bankrupting debtors. The administrative and legal costs and complications ofrecreating a national currency would be enormous. Businessesspent billions over several years to prepare for the changeover.Any country leaving would have to start again from scratch. "Households would probably try as much as possible to hoardfiduciary euros and resist converting them into the new nationalcurrency," economist Gilles Moec of Deutsche Bank wrote thisyear. "This would probably drastically reduce current spending." Any attempt to fix a new exchange rate would likely comeunder immediate attack on currency markets, while a float wouldinitially trigger an uncontrolled depreciation of the new money. Trade flows would be severely disrupted. Business costswould become unpredictable, inhibiting investment. Labour unrestand social strife would be inevitable as citizens faced massunemployment, inflation and brutal public spending cuts. That would far outweigh any potential boost to exports ortourism revenues from a devaluation. "But what if the bank runs and financial crisis happenanyway?" Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman asked on hisblog last week, citing a slow-motion run on Irish banks. An exit that is neither planned nor chosen but imposed byirresistible market forces would dramatically reduce themarginal cost of leaving the euro, Krugman contended. That economic logic underestimates the political will thathas driven European monetary union since its inception. The creation of the euro was a triumph of politics overeconomics. Don't bank on that being reversed now. (Editing by Ruth Pitchford)             ]]></raw>
