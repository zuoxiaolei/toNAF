<raw><![CDATA[ * Jozef Makuch becomes central bank governor * Replaces Ivan Sramko for a five-year term * Will take a seat on ECB's governing council  (Adds quote, background, details) BRATISLAVA, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The Slovak president IvanGasparovic appointed Jozef Makuch as new central bank governoron Tuesday, a position that gives him a seat on the EuropeanCentral Bank's governing council. Makuch, 56, who previously served as a central bank boardmember and the head of the country's Financial MarketsAuthority, replaces Ivan Sramko, who turned down an offer toserve a second five-year term. Slovakia became the euro zone's 16th member last January,the second ex-communist country, after Slovenia, to adopt thesingle currency. All member state central bank chiefs hold a vote on theECB's governing board, which decides on monetary policy. Makuch will lead the bank in times when the heavilyexport-reliant economy is recovering from its deepest downturnsever, with the European Commission expecting Slovaks to emergefrom the crisis as the EU's fastest growing economy this year. "There are challenges for the bank, the law on the centralbank has changed and we have to implement it," Makuch said afterhis appointment. Slovakia adopted a law last year cutting the number of boardmembers to five from the current eleven -- one governor, twovice-governors and two board members. The approved legislation also lifts the limits on the numberof appointments to various board positions and slaps a two-termlimit on the posts of governor and vice-governors. Makuch, Slovakia's fourth central bank governor to date,said key challenges for the future include implementation of theregulation rules of the financial sector as drafted by theEuropean Union. Makuch, who was originally not a considered a frontrunnerfor the job with analysts saying he was little-known to marketsand the public, is expected to attend his first ECB meeting onThursday. The European Central Bank is expected to keep euro zoneinterest rates on hold at a record low of 1.0 percent onThursday and signal it remains in a neutral gear as it waits forthe region's economy to firm up.
