<raw><![CDATA[ MESEBERG, Germany, June 5 (Reuters) - Berlin and Moscowagree that a stable euro is key for global financial stabilityand sustainable economic growth, German Chancellor Angela Merkeland Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Saturday. "I explained to him how the European Union feels committedto a stable euro, and therefore agreed on the rescue package,"Merkel said at a joint news conference with Medvedev. Global policymakers were forced to take unprecedented actionlast month, erecting a 750 billion euro safety net to prevent aGreek debt crisis from spiralling across the euro zone. Medvedev said he was confident the EU would be able to copewith its problems and hoped the euro zone would remain stable. "It is important for the euro zone itself, for partners suchas the Russian Federation and ... for the global financialsystem," he said. "If today, you remove this pillar from the global financialsystem, I'm afraid the consequences will be worse than when thecrisis started in 2008." Russia wanted a "stable and predictable" rate of both thedollar and the euro, Medvedev added. Merkel said Russia and Germany broadly agreed on questionsof financial market regulation, which would be addressed at ameeting of the Group of 20 industrial and emerging economieslater this month. "The G20 meeting will above all address the question ofsustainable growth, as well as the topic of financial marketregulation -- upon which there is great agreement between Russiaand Germany," Merkel said. Growth should not be achieved at the cost of high deficits,Merkel said, but should be sustainable. "In Germany, the question of reasonable deficits which arenot too high plays a key role," she said. "We believe thatgrowth should not be achieved at the cost of high deficits, butwe should achieve growth in a sustainable way."(Reporting by Denis Dyomkin, Additional Reporting by DmitryZhdannikov, Writing by Sarah Marsh; editing by John Stonestreet)             ]]></raw>
