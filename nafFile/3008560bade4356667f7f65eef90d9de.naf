<raw><![CDATA[ * Moody's puts Spain's Aa1 rating on review* Cites vulnerability to funding stress * But expects no Irish-style bailout * Bank shares slide  (Updates market prices at close) By Paul Day MADRID, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's putSpain's debt on review for a possible downgrade on Wednesday,highlighting concerns over a funding crunch next year andsending bank shares sliding. The ratings agency said it did not expect Madrid to have tofollow Greece and Ireland into taking a European Union bailout,but added that it could not rule out that scenario. "Moody's does not believe that Spain's solvency is underthreat and in its base case assumptions does not expect theSpanish government to have to ask for EFSF liquidity support,"Moody's lead analyst on Spain Kathrin Muehlbronner said. "We don't rule it out entirely but this is not the basecase," Muehlbronner told Reuters in a telephone interview. Spain's government has slashed spending to reduce its budgetdeficit, reformed labour laws, forced weak savings banks tomerge and announced state asset sales to try to calm marketfears over its finances. Muehlbronner said Moody's expects Spain to achieve itsfiscal target and bring its deficit down to 6 percent of grossdomestic product (GDP) next year. The news knocked bank shares, but the key risk premium ofSpanish debt as measured by the spread on ten-year debt comparedwith equivalent euro zone benchmark bunds ended the day lower ataround 245 basis points as markets positioned themselves beforetwo bond auctions on Thursday. Investors see financial trouble lurking in banks' exposureto bad loans from Spain's burst real estate bubble and in highdeficits run by autonomous regional governments. Spain's government faces a bond redemption at the end ofApril of 15.5 billion euros while its banks will be looking torefinance around 35 billion euros in the Spring. Economy Minister Elena Salgado reiterated on Wednesdaypledges that autonomous regions would meet deficit cuttingtargets and that banks would publish more detailed reports oftheir finances. "The declaration today (by Moody's)... is based on threeissues on which we believe we can resolve all doubts in the veryshort term," Salgado said at a news conference. A pre-Christmas market lull may have taken some of the heatout of the euro zone debt crisis but the ratings agencies seerisks unabated in 2011, and possibly spreading. Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Belgian debt tonegative on Tuesday, saying that if the country's inability toform a government threatened deficit- and debt-reduction goals,its AA+ rating could be cut within six months.  EURO, BANK SHARES HIT The euro extended losses early in the day on the Moody'sannouncement and Spanish banking shares fell with euro zone'sbiggest bank Santander closing down 2.64 percent at 8.15 euros. Spain paid over one percentage point more to sell itstreasury bills at an auction on Tuesday compared with lastmonth, and yields are also expected to rise at Thursday's bondsales. Moody's, which has an Aa1 rating on Spain, cited thecountry's vulnerability to funding stresses, weak marketconfidence and the possibility of greater public debt should thebanks need further capitalisation. Moody's cites "issues that have been on the radar screensfor quite some time, but nonetheless at this particular junctureit does have the potential to generate more negative impact onmarket sentiment," said Nick Matthews, economist at RBS. Earlier this week, Moody's kept its negative outlook onSpain's banks and estimated they might need to recapitalise byan extra 17 billion euros. Spain's sovereign debt lost its last top-line triple-Arating on Sep. 30 when Moody's became the last of the main threeratings agencies to downgrade it by one notch. It has been under intense scrutiny from internationalmarkets since Ireland was forced to take a 85 billion euro aidpackage in November, due to worries over similarities betweenthe countries' property busts and banking systems. Spain's government has denied it would also need to apply tothe European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and rejectedany comparison between its economic position and Ireland's.
