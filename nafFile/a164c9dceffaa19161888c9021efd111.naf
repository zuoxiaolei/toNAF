<raw><![CDATA[ * EU leaders' Dec. 16-17 summit will focus on debt crisis * Pressure on for more action to resolve problems * Bond markets calmer, but problems brewing for 2011  By Luke Baker BRUSSELS, Dec 9 (Reuters) - European Union leaders hold asummit next week under pressure to take further steps to quellthe euro zone debt crisis, despite European bond markets showingsigns of calming down before the end of the year.Euro zone finance ministers took no extra action to tacklethe crisis this week, saying a 750 billion euro ($1 trillion)EU/IMF fund was sufficient to deal with Ireland's bailout andany potential problems spreading to Portugal or Spain. That non-move caused further unrest in debt markets, withyields on Greek, Irish, Portuguese and Spanish bonds all brieflyrising. But traders say these movements are being exaggerated bythin volumes, with investment houses traditionally closing theirbooks before the year-end. Activity will pick up in January. "Given the brutality of the moves we've seen in recent days,we may well have seen most of the negative news for bondmarkets," said David Page, an interest rate strategist at LloydsTSB in London. But EU financial officials have repeatedly warned there isno room for complacency, aware that when markets last calmeddown, during July and August, it was not a signal that thecrisis was over -- if anything, it has worsened since. "The risks are still there and I don't think anyone feelsreassured," Marc Ostwald, a strategist at Monument Securities,said this week. "This is about reassurance of leadership." The Dec. 16-17 summit is supposed to agree on the shape of apermanent mechanism for handling crises from 2013. But the discussion will also focus on how to handle theimmediate situation. There is growing divergence between Germanyand other member states on what measures to take, including overwhether euro area bonds make sense, and whether the EuropeanCentral Bank might buy more distressed debt. France added its voice to Germany's staunch opposition tothe idea of euro bonds on Thursday, saying it saw little needfor such an instrument, which would effectively mean all 16 eurozone member states sharing debt issuance and credit risk. "It raises difficulties notably in terms of sharing costsand profits," said a spokesman for French President NicolasSarkozy. "There is no need to discuss new propositions."  SPAIN'S CAJAS A LINGERING PROBLEM Instead, what analysts say could emerge at the summit is acommitment to enlarge, or at least look at enlarging, the 750billion euro European financial stability facility. Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, whichrepresents the EU's 27 states, hinted as much this week, saying:"Up to now there is no need to increase the means available forthe facility. If needed, we will consider (it)." The other open question is what steps the European CentralBank may be induced to take to support action by the EU leaders.Speculation in financial markets in recent weeks has been thatthe ECB could launch a massive bond-buying programme -- possibly1 trillion euros or more -- to quell market pressure. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has sidestepped thosesuggestions, but the bank has marginally increased its purchasesof Portuguese and Irish debt in recent days, market sources say. The fact yields on the sovereign debt of Portugal, Spain andother peripheral euro zone states have come off record highs maytherefore tempt some EU leaders to conclude the measures beingtaken are working. But analysts warn against such temptation. Daniel Gros, an economist and director of the Centre ForEuropean Policy Studies, draws the analogy of a crowded cinema.If there is a large exit and lots of fire extinguishers,everyone is more comfortable in the event of a fire. The eurozone, he says, has yet to create a big enough fire exit. "For example, the Spanish banking sector alone hasshort-term liabilities of several hundred billion euros. Toreturn to the cinema analogy: investors know that the exit isnot large enough to allow them all to squeeze through at thesame time," he wrote this week, warning that if the EU does nottake big, bold decisions, it may never turn sentiment around. Whatever decisions leaders take next week, the root causesof the crisis -- deep structural deficits, large debts andinefficient economies -- will remain. Governments have to tacklethem in the coming years. In the meantime, methods have to befound to handle the pressure on sovereign and bank debt. Next year, the euro zone will issue in the region of 800billion euros of debt, according to Citigroup. If bond marketuncertainty picks up again early next year, as analysts expect,funding that amount is going to prove taxing. And there are other lingering problems. Spain's regionalsavings banks, the cajas, are under pressure to come clean ontheir liabilities and potential losses on property loans. Spain's central bank will conduct a new round of healthchecks on the cajas and report back in March. Bigger hiddenlosses in Spain's banking sector could be a trigger for furthervolatility on markets and renewed euro zone debt problems.
