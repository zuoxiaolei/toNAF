<raw><![CDATA[ BERLIN, July 15 (Reuters) - Germany faces a sharpdeterioration in corporate credit conditions next year as thefull impact of recession feeds through to company balancesheets, the BGA exporters' association said on Wednesday. "The credit squeeze will, accordingly, be worse still in2010," BGA President Anton Boerner told a news conference. Germany has already agreed a "bad bank" plan which allowslenders to divest themselves of toxic assets. The governmenthopes that unloading the problem assets will help banks to lend,providing a boost to investment and spurring economic growth. However, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck and some otherpolicymakers are concerned that credit conditions may tighten,throttling Europe's largest economy just as it shows the firstsigns of emerging from its deepest post-war recession. European Central Bank data for Germany shows annual growthin lending to non-financial corporations slowed to 3.9 percentin May from 8.5 percent in January, and down from nearly 12percent in October. Steinbrueck has written to leading German bankers tellingthem they have a responsibility to lend money to businesses. Hewants to review the credit situation with them on Sept. 1. He has also floated the idea of Germany's central bank, theBundesbank, buying up corporate bonds to help ease a creditsqueeze. However, a government spokesman said Germany is notconsidering granting credit to companies through the Bundesbank. "Such considerations are playing no role in the governmentat the moment," spokesman Thomas Steg said on Wednesday. The global economic downturn has hit Germany's export sectorhard. The BGA expects exports to decline by 18 percent thisyear, before increasing by 5-7 percent in 2010, Boerner said.
