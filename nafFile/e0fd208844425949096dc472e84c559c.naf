<raw><![CDATA[ * Data shows manufacturing growth is holding up- Cable * Says deficit cuts rewarded with "favourable" bond yields (Adds quotes, background) LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - Data on British economic outputshows manufacturing growth is holding up, but the governmentmight need to take extra steps to boost still sluggish banklending, Business Secretary Vince Cable said. The Office for National Statistics said earlier on Wednesdaythat Britain's economy expanded by 0.5 percent between Januaryand March, in line with forecasts, after contracting by the sameamount in the final three months of 2010. That meant the economy has stagnated since September. "If you drill beneath the overall growth figures thismorning, you'll see that manufacturing growth is beingsustained, which is exactly how it should be," Cable told aparliamentary committee. Services and manufacturing were both robust over the latestquarter, expanding by 0.9 percent and 1.1 percent respectively.The coalition government's growth strategy was "clearlyvisible" in recent statistics, he said. The government was beingrewarded for its efforts to cut Britain's big budget deficitwith "favourable bond yields". But access to finance was one of the "most difficult"constraints on growth, he said. Bank of England figures lastweek showing negative lending to small businesses were "clearlyvery disappointing indeed," Cable said. Despite government attempts to stimulate lending, "in termsof access to finance there is still a serious problem," he said. The government finalised a deal with banks in February tocurb bonuses and boost lending to businesses. The deal, known as "Project Merlin", would see Britain's topbanks lend about 190 billion pounds ($313 billion) gross tobusinesses this year, up from about 179 billion previously. Asked why banks were not lending to small businesses, Cablesaid the banks would say they were giving priority tostrengthening their balance sheets and "that is takingprecedence over the credit demands of the real economy." He said there was a shortage of demand for credit, althoughhe said a lot of demand was discouraged by people being put offfrom applying for loans. "We have put in place a series of measures to try to counterthis. If they don't work we'll have to look at others," he said.
