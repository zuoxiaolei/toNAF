<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The pound pushed lower against the U.S. dollar on Friday, dropping to a two-month low as fresh concerns over the outlook for economic growth in the euro zone and fears over U.S. fiscal policy weighed on demand for risk-related assets.   GBP/USD hit 1.5905 during European afternoon trade, the pair's lowest since September 6; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.5918, shedding 0.41%.   Cable was likely to find support at 1.5882, the low of September 6 and resistance at 1.6020, the session high.   Euro zone concerns re-emerged after Germany's Economy Ministry said that growth was likely to slow in the fourth quarter and the first three months of 2013, while the French central bank said it expected the euro zone's second-largest economy to slip into recession towards the end of 2012.   Investors were also eyeing a Greek parliament vote on Sunday on its 2013 budget. The budget must be passed to unlock a further tranche of international aid.   On Thursday, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said next week may still be too early to make a decision on granting further aid to Athens, despite a successful vote on new austerity measures.   Markets were also jittery amid concerns over the U.S. fiscal cliff, automatic tax hikes and spending cuts due to come into effect on January 1 unless lawmakers can reach an agreement, which could threaten U.S. and global growth.   In the U.K., official data earlier showed that the trade deficit narrowed more-than-expected in September, hitting GBP8.4 billion from a deficit of GBP10 billion the previous month.  Analysts had expected the trade deficit to narrow to GBP8.9 billion in September.   Elsewhere, sterling was lower against the euro with EUR/GBP adding 0.13%, to hit 0.7983.   Also Friday, official data showed that industrial production in France dropped 2.7% in September, more than the expected 1% decline, after a 1.9% rise the previous month. In Italy, industrial production tumbled 1.5% in September, compared with expectations for a 1.4% drop, after a 1.7% increase the previous month.  Later in the day, the U.S. was to produce preliminary data from the University of Michigan on consumer sentiment.              ]]></raw>
