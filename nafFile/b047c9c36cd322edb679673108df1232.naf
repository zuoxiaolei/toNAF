<raw><![CDATA[ By Dominic Lau LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Germany banned nakedshort-selling of certain financial instruments on Wednesday,sending the euro and European shares lower and raising concernsover market liquidity. German financial watchdog BaFin said the ban had beenimposed "due to the extraordinary volatility in government bondsin the euro zone" and warned that massive short selling couldhave endangered the stability of the financial system. Here are some of the key issues raised:  WHAT EXACTLY IS COVERED BY THE BAN? Germany banned naked short selling of euro zone governmentbonds and shares in 10 leading German financial institutions, aswell as transactions in credit default swaps (CDS) linked toeuro government bonds. The ban took effect from midnight andwill run through March 31, 2011. Short selling is a trade that bets a price will fall. Nakedshort selling is when a trader sells a financial instrumentwithout first borrowing the instrument or ensuring that it canbe borrowed.  WHAT DOES THE BAN AIM TO DO? Large short positions typically push the price of thesecurities lower and the ban is seen as aiming to limit pressureon euro zone peripheral economies such as Greece, Portugal andSpain. Greece has required a 110 billion euro ($137 billion)emergency loan from the European Union and the InternationalMonetary Fund. Yet some analysts have also voiced concern thatthe ban could be aimed at heading off a problem in the pipelineof which financial markets are not yet aware. Analysts say it is unclear whether the ban will work andthat it could backfire on Germany if other financial centres donot follow suit.  WHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT ON MARKET LIQUIDITY AND WHY? Market liquidity has been affected by Berlin's solo effortto drive away speculators as the move sparked concern othercountries might introduce similar measures. Data provider Markit said that uncertainty has created"febrile" conditions in the CDS market, resulting in lowliquidity and high volatility. Corporates and financials with peripheral exposure haveunderperformed markedly, "indicating that the market is becomingmore wary of a peripheral sovereign default," Markit said. Investors tend to cut positions in riskier assets in such ahigh volatile market conditions.  HOW BIG IS NAKED SHORT SELLING OR SHORT SELLING IN THESEASSETS? The ban will be applied to institutions operating underGerman securities watchdog BaFin, though it will not includebranches of German firms outside the country. Analysts and traders say the bulk of short selling is beingdone in New York and London, but added that it was difficult toquantify how much of it was naked. For example, Data Explorers, which tracks the amount ofstock out on loan to give an indication of how much "shorting"of a stock there is, said Commerzbank is the only stock of the10 German financial firms subject to the ban on naked shortselling where investors held a significant short position. It said 5.1 percent of Commerzbank stock was out on loan atMonday's close, while only 1 percent of Deutsche Bank was out onloan, and the amount on loans for all the other eight stocks wasunder 2 percent. It did not specify the proportion of such trades which werenaked short sales.  WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THIS WILL HEAD OFF PRESSURE ON EUROPERIPHERAL BONDS AND SOVEREIGN CDS? Premium investors demand to hold 10-year Greek governmentbonds rather than German benchmark Bunds rose on Wednesday butthis trend was not necessarily expected to be sustained ordriven by the ban. The confusion in European markets, even as investors soughtsafe havens, saw U.S. Treasuries outperform German debt and thiscould turn into a more sustainable move. The ban has also put pressure on the euro, which was viewedas a key target for betting against European assets forinvestors who find themselves unable to short sell bonds orequities, analysts said. The euro fell to a fresh four-year low against the dollar,while European shares fell more than 2 percent by midday onWednesday. Shares in most of Germany's financial companies wereweaker.  HOW SUSTAINED WILL THE MARKET REACTION BE? In the medium to long run, the clampdown will be bad forBunds as it takes away the ability of investors to hedge theirpositions through buying German government bonds and shortingbonds in other peripheral economies, according to Sean Maloney,bond strategist at Nomura. The impact of the ban on liquidity and market conditionswill also crucially depend on whether other countries -- andwhich ones -- take a similar line. If big financial centres,such as London and New York, have different rules, there willalways be ways to circumvent the ban.  HOW CAN INVESTORS GET AROUND THE BAN? Numerous ideas have emerged about how traders and investorscould translate their negative views on the assets subject tothe German ban into action without falling foul of the BaFinrules. These include: 1) Carry on shorting euro government bonds, sovereign CDS inNew York and London as the ban only applies to institutionsoperating under German securities watchdog BaFin. 2) Buy CDS in senior German financials or indexes such asiTraxx Main. 3) Sell DAX exchange traded funds and buy non-financialGerman stocks, as German exporters are likely to benefit from aweaker euro. 4) Sell something else correlated to the banned instruments,such as European bank stocks      (Additional reporting by Jane Merriman, William James, EmeliaSithole, Veronica Brown, Steve Slater, Alex Chambers, BlaiseRobinson, Natsuko Waki and Joanne Frearson; Editing by JasonNeely)             ]]></raw>
