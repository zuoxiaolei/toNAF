<raw><![CDATA[ * Strong IBM and Intel earnings boost risk sentiment * Euro and commodity currencies rise, yen under pressure * Australian dollar hits 29-year high above $1.0600 (Changes dateline, adds quote, details, previous TOKYO) By Neal Armstrong LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - The euro and commoditycurrencies such as the Australian dollar gained on Wednesday, asupbeat corporate earnings in the U.S. prompted investors to buyriskier assets amid rising growth and inflation expectations. Gains in U.S. and European shares soothed market sentimentafter nerves were rattled on Monday by S&P's warning on U.S.credit ratings and on fears that Greece will have to restructureits debt. Intel Corp forecast revenues well above Wall Street'stargets, sending its shares higher in after hours trade.  International Business Machines results also outpacedexpectations and it raised its full-year profit forecast.  The moves showed investors continue to favourhigher-yielding currencies at the expense of the dollar and yen,and a rise in Asian and European equities underscored a reboundin risk-taking sentiment. "Investor focus is on the earnings season in the U.S. andthis is key in driving growth expectations and pushingstock markets higher. This keeps focus away from euro zoneperiphery right now," said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategistat UBS in Zurich. The euro climbed 0.9 percent to 119.45 yen, pulling awayfrom a two-week trough of 116.49 yen hit on EBS earlier thisweek. The euro rose 0.6 percent versus the dollar to $1.4420,having clawed above short-term resistance around the $1.4365/80area. It's next target was last week's 15-month high of $1.4521. Samarjit Shankar, analyst at BNY Mellon, said the bank'sflow indicators showed the euro was the strongest net boughtcurrency among the G10 as its decline earlier this week gave themarket better re-entry levels. Data highlighting business activity in Germany and Francecontinued to outpace the rest of the common currency bloc keptalive rate hike expectations by the European Central Bank. "This has also buoyed the single currency despite thelingering sovereign debt crisis in the region's peripheralmarkets," Shankar added. Spain will issue up to 3.5 billion euros of 10- and 13-yearpaper on Wednesday after yields for the euro zone statesstruggling with high debt jumped this week.  AUSSIE BUOYANT The chase for yields continues to benefit the Australiandollar, which hit a fresh 29-year high of $1.0609 in earlyEuropean trade. Traders said stop-losses were scattered above1.0610. The yen got no help from data showing that Japan logged asmaller-than-expected trade surplus in March and that exportsfell more than expected year-on-year, in a sign of thedisruptions caused by a massive earthquake and tsunami thatstruck Japan's northeast on March 11. "There is little doubt that this is a factor for the yen toweaken," said Daisuke Karakama, market economist for MizuhoCorporate Bank in Tokyo. "Two factors that had supported yen strength until now areshrinking U.S.-Japan interest rate differentials and exporterflows. Today's data shows that one of those is weakening,"Karakama added. The dollar rose 0.3 percent from late U.S. trade on Tuesdayto 82.79 yen. Dollar-buying by Japanese importers helped lendthe dollar support against the yen, traders said. The dollar dipped 0.4 percent against a basket of currenciesto 74.772, falling back in the direction of a 16-month trough of74.617 set last week. As the dollar's value falls, the price of gold hit a recordhigh above $1,500 and silver rose to a 31-year high.
