<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar gives back gains from best run in months * All eyes on U.S. Q3 GDP at 1230 GMT * Higher-yielding FX up, stocks supported, yen slips (Recasts, updates prices, adds quote, changes byline)  By Jamie McGeever LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The dollar weakened on Thursdayas dealers took profits from its recent rise, and the selloff inequity markets stalled ahead of data that is expected to showthe U.S. economy returned to growth in the third quarter. Higher-yielding currencies more closely tied to economicgrowth such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars rose, buoyed by a recovery in equities, with traders saying the steepfalls on Wednesday and early Thursday had been overdone. A solid gross domestic product reading could help fosterrenewed optimism about the global economy and fuel furtherbuying of these currencies and others against the dollar. But sentiment is fragile after a slew of recent weak U.S.data that triggered sharp falls in stocks and broad gains forthe dollar and yen.  "We had some risk aversion yesterday and the dollarstronger, but today we expect a strong GDP number," said MarcusHettinger, global FX strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich. "I would expect the dollar to weaken a little bit more," ifthe GDP number is strong, he said. Economists estimate that the government's advance estimatewill show GDP grew 3.3 percent in the third quarter, which wouldmark the first quarter to show positive growth since the secondquarter of 2008. The data is due at 1230 GMT. At 1150 GMT the dollar index was down 0.1 percent at 76.35.It has still gained just over 1 percent this week, however,leaving it on course for its biggest weekly gain in nearly fivemonths. The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.4727 and was up 0.2percent at 133.60 yen, recovering from earlier two-week lows of$1.4683 and 132.81 yen, respectively. Sentiment was helped by a modest recovery on stock markets,with European shares up 0.2 percent and U.S. stock futures rising 0.3-0.4 percent. Among higher-yielding currencies the Australian dollar wasup 0.7 percent against the dollar at $0.9034 and the New Zealanddollar was up 0.8 percent at $0.7260. The New Zealand dollar had fallen to a three-week low afterthe Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) earlier dropped itseasing bias as expected but faced down market pressure for arate rise as soon as early 2010. Against the yen, the U.S. dollar rose 0.1 percent to 90.73yen. ALMUNIA ON FX Thursday's data is expected to reveal that the world'slargest economy has turned a corner, but U.S. data this weekhave raised questions about a sustained recovery, with consumerconfidence dipping to recessionary levels and new home salesfalling unexpectedly. Given the risk-trade correction under way, some dealers saidcurrency markets might react more to weaker figures thanstronger ones, and if so, that could give the dollar a bit morestrength short-term. "We were getting to the point where some currencies werelooking heavily oversold on short-term measures and we are nowseeing a bit of a comeback," said Naeem Wahid, currencystrategist at Bank of Scotland Treasury. Wahid highlighted the high degree of uncertainty about thelikely outcome of the U.S. GDP figures and said a very strongnumber would enable renewed gains for higher risk currencies,while a particularly weak number would push the market back intorisk averse mode. Also on Thursday, the EU's top economic official said majoreconomies should coordinate to limit volatility in foreignexchange markets.  "What we have to do is to maintain the coordination betweenthe main economies of the world, as we do in the G7 and the G20,and exchange rates should be the product of flexible mechanisms.... in tune with market fundamentals," economic and monetaryaffairs commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.             ]]></raw>
