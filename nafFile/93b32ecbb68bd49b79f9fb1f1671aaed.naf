The Swiss franc pared gains against the euro after Hungarysaid it was eyeing a new precautionary standby agreement withthe International Monetary Fund for 2011. The move alleviated some concerns about Hungary's largestock of franc-denominated debt.

Focus is on a three-month tender by the European CentralBank on Wednesday ahead of the expiry of a 12-month operation onThursday when euro zone banks must repay 442 billion euros. A large take-up at the three-month tender would indicatemany banks were still reliant on the central bank lifeline.Spanish, Portuguese and Greek banks have been the largest usersof the ECB's lending facilities. Investors were also keeping an eye on the Germanpresidential election on Wednesday. "We don't expect any surprises, but if it goes into a secondor third round, it would raise questions about German ChancellorAngela Merkel's political support and weigh on the euro," saidAntje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank. That concern along with the ECB expiry are negative risksfor the euro, she said. The euro has support at $1.2145-55, a pivot area stemmingfrom intra-day lows and highs in May and June, and then at about$1.2110, the 61.8 percent retracement of its move up from$1.1876 to near $1.2500 in June.
