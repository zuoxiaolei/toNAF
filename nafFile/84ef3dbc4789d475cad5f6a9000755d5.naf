<raw><![CDATA[ * ECB ramping up concern about liquidity addiction * Analysts see fears bolstering liquidity exit * Central bankers say rates not tool to tackle bubbles  By Marc Jones FRANKFURT, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Growing fears about theunwanted side-effects of the European Central Bank'scrisis-fighting liquidity lifeline are firming policymakers'resolve to pull back on support sooner rather than later. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has warned against bank"addiction" to liquidity support and Governing Council memberAxel Weber said on Thursday it was time to look at the "designof exit strategies from the monetary and fiscal stimulus". Concern about fuelling a new round of asset bubbles alsocomes into the mix although analysts see little chance of theECB formally changing its mandate to include asset prices aswell as consumer prices, or tackling asset prices with ratehikes. Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said earlier thismonth if the abundant liquidity supplied by the ECB did not findits way through to the real economy, it could lead to assetprices overheating. Data on Thursday showed loans to euro zone households andfirms fell further in October, despite the ECB lending banksbillions of euros of funds since the start of the financialcrisis, suggesting much of the cash has been used to rebuildbank balance sheets or been invested in soaring markets. "Low interest rates are pushing some operators tospeculative moves that are not sustainable and may bring theimplosion of mini bubbles," Bini Smaghi said. [ID:nL8147361] The concern about the impact of more than a year of cheapand unlimited funds and the ability of euro zone economies andbanks to be weaned off it, is seeping through into the ECB'sactions, even though analysts do not see a rise from record low1 percent interest rates any time soon. The euro zone's central bank has already taken the firststeps towards unwinding its policy of offering unlimited fundsat fixed interest rates by signalling it is unlikely to keep upone-year loans next year, and tightening the rules for acceptingasset-backed securities as collateral. [ID:nLAG005930] Some national central banks in the bloc have also warnedtheir commercial counterparts to show restraint in taking up theECB's next offer of unlimited 12-month funds -- most notably inGreece, where rising rates on government debt suggest investorsworry about its ability to withstand the exit. [ID:nLG450007] Although Reuters polls show the U.S. Federal Reserve, theBank of England and the ECB all starting to hike rates in thesecond half of next year, the ECB's exit is likely to startbefore then as it phases out the liquidity support which it haspursued more strongly than counterparts. [ECILT/WRAP]  Market prices show overnight cash matching the ECB's policyrate of 1 percent by August -- an effective tightening of 65basis points from today's levels as liquidity ebbs.  "I think they are probably going to be the first to blink onthe liquidity front and the exit front," Schneider ForeignExchange head of market analysis Stephen Gallo said, noting agap between the ECB and other G7 central banks."Clearly there's a divergence growing and one of the reasons... is an awareness on the part of the ECB that this liquidityis going to have nasty repercussions over the medium term ifthey don't try to rein it in gradually over the course of 2010."That doesn't mean to hike to 2 percent by March, but itmeans to have an eye towards exiting rather than keeping policyultra-loose for an ultra-long time." Crunch decisions are due at the Dec. 3 policy meeting: manyof the emergency measures the ECB has put in place to combatfinancial crisis, such as uncapped, fixed-rate lending expire inJanuary, meaning it must either renew them, replace them orscrap them.

Other ECB policymakers including Weber, Christian Noyer andJuergen Stark have also said central banks cannot ignore wildjumps in asset prices, although Weber believes interest ratesare not the right tool to tackle bubbles. [ID:nLK438276]  For graphic on asset prices, please see:http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/119/GLB_RTNSA1109.gif Deutsche Bank economist Mark Wall said policymakers'increased concern about asset prices would confirm theirexisting intention to ease back on the liquidity accelerator. "It's a consideration in their mind when they are thinkingabout the withdrawal of supplementary liquidity, but we arestill months away from a situation where conditions necessitatea tightening of the refi rate," he said. There has been a 70 percent bounce in global stock pricessince March . European shares  have risenmore than 50 percent in a near vertical trajectory, althoughstock markets are still 30-40 percent below their pre-crisispeaks in 2007. Oil prices are also back at $76 a barrel , having morethan doubled since last December. "The ECB will be considering how much their policies arecontributing to asset price bubbles and indeed whether we aregoing through a microcosm of the 2003-2007 bubble," said DavidPage, an economist at Investec. But Societe Generale economist Klaus Baader said it wasdifficult to see what a central bank could do about bubbleswhich were not accompanied by strong money and credit growth --something noticeably absent in Thursday's official figures. "To try to tackle asset prices directly with monetary policy... is a dangerous business because the collateral damage to theeconomy is so large," he said.
