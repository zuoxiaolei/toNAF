<raw><![CDATA[   * U.S. stocks edge higher after U.S. economic data * Oil prices lower on concerns of labor market, stockpiles * All eyes on Friday's U.S. payrolls report (Updates with U.S. market open and economic data, changesbyline, dateline; previous LONDON) By Manuela Badawy NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Stocks rose and U.S.Treasuries fell on Thursday as U.S. data showed strength in theeconomy, but investors were mainly focused on Friday's closelyfollowed U.S. unemployment report for economic clues. Oil prices eased as a drop in weekly U.S. jobless claims,an unexpected rise in pending home sales in July and slightlystronger factory orders failed to soothe concerns abouteconomic weakness in the world's largest energy consumer. The euro was flat against the dollar after comments fromEuropean Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and thedecision by the bank's Governing Council to keep interest ratesat a record low of 1 percent. For details, see[ID:nLDE6810DM]. U.S. Treasury debt prices eased as some strength on WallStreet undermined the safe-haven appeal of government debt. The Dow Jones industrial average  was up 1.67 points,or 0.02 percent, at 10,271.14. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  was up 3.53 points, or 0.33 percent, at 1,083.82. TheNasdaq Composite Index   was up 8.83 points, or 0.41percent, at 2,185.67. "The market was braced for a diaster after what we saw withexisting sales, so this is positive, while the factory orderslooked a little light compared with expectations," said JohnCanally, investment strategist at LPL Financial in Boston. "People are reluctant to do much of anything today exceptposition themselves for tomorrow and digest yesterday'sgains." World stocks  hit a two-week high earlier asoptimism from strong U.S. and Chinese manufacturing dataextended into a second day. "I would expect that we are going to have a pretty quietday today. I would say if we are able to hold even through theday and hold on to (Wednesday's) gains that is a good sign,"said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakbrookInvestments LLC, in Lisle, Illinois. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  of top European shareswas slightly lower after surging 2.9 percent on Wednesday,their biggest gain since May, on upbeat manufacturing data fromChina and the United States. The market showed little reaction to Thursday's decision bythe European Central Bank to keep interest rates on hold at arecord low, as expected, amid tepid economic recovery andpersistent concerns about the banking sector. [ID:nLDE68114V] The euro  was up 0.02 percent at $1.2814 from aprevious session close of $1.2811 supported by healthy resultsat Spanish and French bond auctions and stable globalequities. France and Spain sold 12.2 billion euros of bonds, with theaverage yield on the 5-year Bono dropping at auction and thepaper easily absorbed as the yield fell after the tender. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.14percent at 84.30 from a previous session close of 84.420. The focus now is on the Labor Department's widely watchedmonthly employment report, with analysts predicting U.S.non-farm payrolls probably fell for a third straight month inAugust. [ID:nN31235915] Currency markets are not paying too much attention "toanything but the jobs number tomorrow," said Greg Salvaggio,vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
