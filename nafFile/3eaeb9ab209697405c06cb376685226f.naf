<raw><![CDATA[ * Wen Jiabao aims to boost China-Africa ties * All eyes on offers of new Chinese aid * Growing relationship draws fire in West * Chinese commentators say West envious of friendship By Ben Blanchard SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Chinese PremierWen Jiabao meets African leaders on Sunday, aiming to boost arelationship which politically goes back decades and is now  economically booming -- to the discomfort of some in the West. All eyes will be on new offers of aid to Africa at themeeting in Egypt, after President Hu Jintao promised $5 billionin loans and credit at the last summit in Beijing in 2006. Blossoming trade and business ties have drawn Westerncriticism that Beijing is only interested in African resources,while Chinese commentators retort that envious Europeans stilltreat the continent like a colony. Wen himself underlined the strength of the relationship."Despite the great distance between China and Africa, thefriendship between our two peoples has remained strong," he tolda business forum in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikhbefore the main meeting. Chinese officials have been coy about exactly how much moreWen may offer. But a draft action plan, details of which wereobtained by Reuters, showed China will increase aid to Africancountries despite the effects of the global economic crisis.[ID:nKAR754025] "China has all along had an interest in Africa'sdevelopment, and genuinely wants to build homes for Africans andmake a contribution towards improving livelihoods," ChineseCommerce Minister Chen Deming wrote in the state-runInternational Business Daily this week. China's friendship with Africa dates back to the 1950s, whenBeijing backed liberation movements in the continent fighting tothrow off colonial rule. Trade has jumped in the past decade, driven by Chinesehunger for resources to power its economic boom and Africandemand for cheap Chinese products. Still, this has not been without its critics, who say Chinais only interested in African resources and supports governmentswith dubious human rights records as a means to get them. Such criticism makes China angry, and draws rebukes that theWest still views Africa as though it were a colony. "The West is envious of China and Africa drawing closer,"popular Chinese tabloid the Global Times, published by CommunistParty mouthpiece the People's Daily, wrote on Tuesday. "Europeans view Africa as their own backyard," the newspaperquoted Chinese Africa expert Xu Weizhong as saying. "Of coursethey feel uncomfortable about the arrival of the Chinese." Some Africans welcome how China's approach differs from thatof Europe or the United States.  "China's policy is based on mutual development. Few Westerncountries have a foreign policy like this -- most are abouttelling Africans what to do," said Kwaku Atuahene-Gima,executive director of the Africa programme at the China EuropeInternational Business School in Shanghai. China says it is up to Africans to decide whether therelationship is good for them, and is sure they will say it is. "Practice proves that the China-Africa relationship ismutually beneficial, and cooperation is win-win, embodying thewishes of the people and the demands of the times," ministerChen wrote.
