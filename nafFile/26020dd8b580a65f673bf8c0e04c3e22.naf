The Australian dollar fell as severe floods in north-eastAustralia were expected to impact coal production, a majorcontributor to its economy. The single currency was helped against the dollar by steadybuying from Asian central banks after the euro area purchasingmanagers' index (PMI) was revised upwards on Monday from theearlier flash estimate, indicating a pick up in the region'sgrowth momentum. Comments from a Chinese official, who said on Monday thecountry would continue buying Spanish debt. [ID:nLDE702068] alsohelped support the euro. The single currency was up 0.4 percent from late U.S.trading on Monday at $1.3404 , but traders reported strongoffers from macro accounts and analysts remained sceptical aboutits ability to rally further. "I do not think these gains in the euro can be sustainableand as volumes start picking up investors will focus on upcomingheavy bond issuances from the euro zone," Geoffrey Yu, currencystrategist at UBS. In the next two months an estimated 150-200 billion euros ofgovernment bonds are scheduled be issued by euro zone countries,some of whom are struggling with rising budget deficits andhigher borrowing costs. Data on Monday showed U.S. manufacturing grew at its fastestclip in seven months in December and construction spending hit afive-month high in November, helping to fuel a rise in globalequity markets. [ID:nN03175600] "We are returning to normal levels of trading and the keythemes that people are coming back to is structural weakness inthe euro zone and worries about the Chinese economy," saidJeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets. The dollar rose 0.6 percent to 82.18 yen  with tradersseeing offers around 82.50 and near-term resistance at the55-day moving average of 82.60. The euro rose nearly 1 percentto trade above 110 yen . Markets were awaiting minutes of the Federal Open MarketCommittee's Dec. 14 meeting later in the session. Focus willmainly be on U.S jobs data and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke'stestimony to the Senate, both due on Friday.  AUSSIE FALLS The Australian dollar fell more than 1 percent to $1.0055, retreating from a 28-year peak around $1.0257 set onFriday. Massive flooding in north-east Australia fuelled worriesover coal production. Traders said funds sold Aussie for euros,taking profit on long Aussie positions taken in the run-up tothe end of 2010. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar rose 1.2 percent to0.9452 , off an all-time low just above 0.9300 set onFriday. The euro was up 1.4 percent against the franc ,pulling back from last week's record low of 1.2398 francs asinvestors reversed some long Swiss franc positions built inDecember.
