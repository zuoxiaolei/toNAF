<raw><![CDATA[ SYDNEY, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank chiefsaid on Friday that monetary policy was likely to remain on holdfor some time, but also sounded upbeat on the health of theeconomy, suggesting the next move in interest rates is likely tobe up.	 The Australian dollar dipped to a low of $1.0005after his comments, while interbank bill futures <0#YIB:> showedlittle reaction with markets still betting the central bankwon't lift rates until late in the year.	 Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens told aparliamentary committee that it was reasonable to assume thatrates will remain on hold for some time.	 He also said the effects of serious floods and Cyclone Yasi,which caused widespread damage and dealt a major blow to somecrops, would not permanently scar the economy.	 "We do not think the effects on activity of these eventswill derail the expansion. Nor should the price effects pose aserious threat to the achievement of the medium-term goal forinflation, provided the community can understand their temporarynature and expectations of ongoing inflation remainwell-anchored," Stevens said.	 Stevens said Australia's terms of trade were higher thanassumed three months ago and will probably peak higher and laterthan the central bank had previously assumed.	 The Reserve Bank of Australia kept interest rates unchangedat 4.75 percent this month. Last week the central bank said itwould look past the impact of recent floods when settinginterest rates and stay focused on the medium term outlook forstrong economic growth.
