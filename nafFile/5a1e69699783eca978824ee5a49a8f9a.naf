<raw><![CDATA[    * Wall Street, euro find footing after recent lows  * Rally of U.S. bonds, German Bunds intact on Greece fears  * Troubling U.S. economic data adds to investors' anxiety  * Oil edges up on upbeat demand forecast; gold flat (Recasts, updates market action) By Richard Leong NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks, oil and theeuro pulled back from the brink of another sell-off onThursday, as investors awaited signs the internationalcommunity could prevent Greece from defaulting on its debt. Jitters about whether the euro-zone member is edgingcloser to default fueled buying of low-risk government bondsfor a second straight day. A strong early rebound on Wall Street ran out of steam,with uncertainty about Greece sending stocks lower, led bydeclines in shares of mining, steel and other materialscompanies. Escalating anxiety over Greece, which could receive 125billion euros in aid, stoked safe-haven bids for high-ratedgovernment debt as shares touched a three-month low. "People are down in the dumps right now. The damage hasbeen done," said Robert Zukowski, senior analyst at 4Cast Ltdin New York. "The Greek debt situation is not going away." There is growing concern that a "disorderly" Greek defaultcould roil the worldwide financial system and dry up lending,similar to what happened after the collapse of Lehman Brothersin September 2008. "That's a disaster scenario," said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia,although he added that the chance of a disorderly default isremote for now. The anxiety over a possible Greek debt default supportedgold prices and gave investors a reason to buy low-riskgovernment bonds for a second straight day. U.S. oil prices edged up after an energy agency predicteda sharp spike in world crude demand in third quarter. In an exceptionally volatile session, stocks and the eurobobbed in and out of positive territory amid worries thatGreece's debt troubles might spiral into another globalcrisis. Some analysts worry the debt crisis in Greece and weakereuro-zone countries could become as bad as the 2007-2009global credit crunch that brought down U.S. investment banksBear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. "The situation in Greece is starting to run away a littlebit and sort of feels like the Bear Stearns/Lehman run-up thatwe saw in 2007," said Brad Bechtel, managing director of FarosTrading in Stamford, Connecticut. "The euro zone is setting upfor a similar situation where the coordinated answer they needis not coming quick enough." Adding to investor worries was more evidence of a rapiddeceleration in U.S. economic activity. In U.S. stock trading, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 64.25 points, or 0.54 percent, to end at11,961.52. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  rose 2.22points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,267.64. But the Nasdaq CompositeIndex  slipped 7.76 points, or 0.29 percent, to closeat 2,623.70. Earlier, the Nasdaq was down slightly more than 1percent. In Europe the FTSEurofirst 300 index  fell 0.42percent to end at 1,084.47, its lowest close since mid-March. The MSCI world equity index  dropped 1percent to 327.46, wiping out its 2011 gains. At the close,the index was slightly more than 1 point above its session lowof 326.06, which was its lowest level since March 18th. In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei  fell 1.7 percent toclose at 9,411.28, following Wednesday's sharp sell-off onWall Street. LIFELINE FOR GREECE Investors have become more nervous about whether Athenswill receive another bout of aid, estimated at 120 billioneuros. European officials and the International Monetary Fund aretrying to come up with a rescue package, while the Greekgovernment is divided over the austerity measures needed andhow to make private investors share the burden. "We still feel that they can come to the rescue in time,and it is not out of control completely just yet, but it isgetting dangerously close," Bechtel said. "All the riskindicators are starting to show stress." The cost of insuring Greek sovereign debt for five yearsjumped to 1,900 basis points -- the highest in the world. The growing financial stress from Greece's fiscal mess wasreflected in the jump in yields on Spanish government bonds toan 11-year high and rising borrowing costs in the Londoninterbank market.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note slipped to a six-month low at 2.92 percent, down 5basis points on the day.
