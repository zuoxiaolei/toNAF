<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro hits three-week high versus dollar, yen * Investors see rise in U.S. yields as overdone * Euro/dollar stalls at key resistance but stops lurk (Changes dateline, adds quote, detail, previous TOKYO)  By Neal Armstrong LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The euro hit three-week highsversus the dollar and the yen in thin trade on Tuesday, asinvestors took the view that the recent rise in front-end U.S.yields had gone too far, prompting a squeeze of euro shorts. Traders said the market was lightening positions ahead ofthe Federal Reserve's policy meeting later on Tuesday. "The recent rise in front-end U.S. yields looks overdone ascore inflation isn't going to pick up quickly," said GavinFriend, currency strategist at nabCapital. "Also euro zone bond spreads seem to have stabilised on theback of the recent ECB buying which has helped the euro," hesaid. The European Central Bank stepped up its purchases ofgovernment bonds last week, although the amount was still wellbelow levels reached last spring. The dollar's decline this week has coincided with an abruptdrop in U.S. Treasury yields and a Moody's warning that it couldmove a step closer to cutting the U.S. triple-A credit rating. The euro rallied to $1.3476 on trading platform EBS, itshighest since Nov. 23, having opened the week in Asia around$1.3205. It stood at $1.3446, up 0.4 percent on the day, afterbeing capped by resistance at $1.3475, the 38.2 percentretracement of the euro's November decline. "It looks like it was more a squeeze of positioning thananything else, particularly in the euro because we know themarket is well short," a trader at a U.S. investment bank said. Traders reported stop-loss orders lurking at $1.3490/1.3500,adding the move looked to be driven by speculators in a thinyear-end market. The dollar fell broadly, hitting a three-week low versus acurrency basket at 78.952. It slipped 0.2 percent to 83.25 yen after shedding 0.6 percent on Monday, with traders seeingdecent bids from 83.20 to 83.00.  U.S. YIELDS FALL BEFORE FOMC Buyers for U.S. bonds emerged after benchmark Treasuryyields surged to six-month highs on Monday. This helped knockthe 10-year yield down to 3.28 percent from 3.39 percent. The yields fell even as Moody's said that if U.S. PresidentBarack Obama's tax and unemployment benefit package became law,in a plan agreed last week, debt levels could rise, making anegative outlook on the rating more likely.  "The dollar is under pressure as Treasury yields,especially in the medium-term zone, have dropped quitesignificantly ahead of the FOMC meeting," said Gen Kawabe,manager at Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking. The Federal Reserve policy board meets later on Tuesday andis expected to reaffirm its quantitative easing policy whileacknowledging the recent better run of data. "The Fed will continue ploughing on with its QE stance. Itwon't divert from its intention to buy $600 billion ingovernment debt until next spring at least," said Friend atnabCapital. The Australian dollar was at $0.9973, near a one-month highof $0.9983 hit on Monday. The Aussie rose above NZ$1.3250 for the first time sincelate 2000, with the kiwi dollar coming under pressure after NewZealand retail sales fell in October, leading the market tofurther push out the timing of any hike in interest rates.
