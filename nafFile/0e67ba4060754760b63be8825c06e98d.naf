<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen hits 14-year high on dollar, breaches 85 yen * Riskier positions unwound on concerns about Dubai debt * Japan finance minister raises prospect of G7 statement(Updates prices, adds quote, changes byline, changesdateline, previous LONDON) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - The yen hit a 14-year highagainst the dollar on Friday, while the greenback rose versusmost other major rivals as fears of a possible Dubai debtdefault boosted safe-haven demand for the U.S. and Japanesecurrencies. The yen later retreated versus the dollar, but it remainedhigher against the euro and higher-yielding currencies such asthe Australian and New Zealand dollars as investors cut riskexposure. The Bank of Japan stepped closer to currency interventionon Friday than at any time in the last five years by checkingexchange rates with commercial banks. Still, market sourcessaid intervention was highly unlikely in the short term. Fordetails, see [ID:nT35213].  Japanese National Strategy Minister Naoto Kan said onFriday the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan will acttogether to deal with the rise in the yen and that he wasconsidering measures himself. "Clearly, it's a reduction in risk appetite as a result ofthe Dubai story, which is helping support the dollar andputting heavy selling pressure on risk assets across theboard," said Omer Esiner, senior market analyst at TravelexGlobal Business Payments in Washington. "The yen, like the dollar, stands to benefit from a furtherreduction in risk appetite," he added. "Right now, I don'tthink the BOJ would intervene in the immediate future." The dollar fell as far as 84.83 yen , its weakestsince 1995 and ever closer to its record low of 79.75, beforepulling back up to 86.91 yen, up 0.5 percent on the day. Dubai struggled to ease fears of debt default on Thursdayafter its move to delay repayments at two flagship firms shookconfidence in the Middle East and raised the prospect offurther huge debt write-offs for banks. [ID:nGEE5AO2FN]. The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, a measure of its valueagainst six major currencies, was up 0.7 percent at 75.335, having been up around 1 percent earlier. The euro was down 0.8 percent at $1.4892 , havingearlier slid as low as $1.4830, more then 3 cents down from a15-month high of $1.5144 reached on Wednesday. "It is likely to take at least a few days before theimplications of the impact of a possible default from Dubai areproperly digested, but for the present it seems that the marketis seeing this negative news as a blow to the global recoverybut not one that will push it off course," said Jane Foley,chief strategist at FOREX.com. JAPAN IN SPOTLIGHT Earlier, Japan signaled growing discomfort with the yen'ssurge and suggested it would be open to a Group of Seven jointstatement on currencies to stem the rise. But jointintervention was extremely unlikely, they said. G7 countries issued a statement in October 2008 when theyen rallied against other major currencies, so traders andanalysts said a joint statement was possible. The speed and scale of dollar/yen's fall was such that arecovery was always likely, analysts say, particularly afterJapan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said the moves were"extreme" and it was possible Japan could respond. "FX markets are nervous as Dubai debt contagion fearsfueled a flight to quality bid, which favored the dollar. Theyen benefited via the crosses, but FX intervention risk rosesignificantly overnight," said Russell Bloom, analyst at ActionEconomics in London. U.S. stocks opened lower while oil was down 5 percent, and gold   fell. weighing on commodity-linkedcurrencies. The Australian dollar fell 1.3 percent against thedollar  and the New Zealand dollar lost 1.6 percentversus the greenback . Implied volatilities on one-week euro/dollar currencyoptions  rose to 13 percent earlier, a high not seensince June. One-week implied volatilities on dollar/yen options surgedabove 18 percent  for the first time since April,sharply up from a 2009 low of 5 percent earlier this week.
