<raw><![CDATA[ * Main rate up by 25 bps, most analysts saw no change * Central bank says growth solid, inflation to pick up * Says risks from global markets, economy not serious * Bond futures fall, won rises, stock prices steady * Analysts expect more rate increases by around 50 bps (Updates with governor's comments, markets, new analyst) By Kim Yeon-hee and Yoo Choonsik SEOUL, July 9 (Reuters) - The Bank of Korea raised interestrates on Friday for the first time since the outbreak of thefinancial crisis and cemented market expectations of moretightening by predicting solid growth and higher inflationahead. The central bank lifted its base rate by 25 basis pointsfrom a record low of 2.0 percent, joining regional peers fromAustralia, to India, Taiwan and Malaysia in the campaign toreturn policy to pre-crisis mode. Investors have been pricing in a rate rise for severalweeks given signs of authorities' growing confidence thatAsia's fourth-largest economy can sustain its recovery, despitelingering doubts about the outlook for U.S. and Europeaneconomies. However, most analysts polled by Reuters had expected a moveeither in August or September and bond futures fell sharplyright after the decision, though later recovered much of thelosses. The won extended gains to more than 1 percent on the dayagainst the dollar. Stock prices were little changed. "It appears that policymakers across Asia are reasonablyconfident about the economic outlook despite concerns about thepotential impact of euro area weakness and a near-term dip ingrowth from the fast pace set earlier this year," said BrianJackson, senior emerging markets strategist at Royal Bank ofCanada in Hong Kong. "We forecast the Bank of Korea to hike rates another 50basis points by the end of the year, with risks increasinglyskewed to the upside." Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong-soo told reporters theeconomy probably expanded by more than 7 percent from a yearearlier in the second quarter and the whole of the first half,another sign of solid recovery from the global slump. He also said annual inflation was set to exceed the 3percent mid-point of the central bank's 2-4 percent targetrange next year, which markets took as a hint the central bankwould bring rates closer to 3 percent by the end of the year. He also noted a sharp rise in mortgage lending in Juneafter a period of subdued growth. "There's no doubt that the base rate of 2 percent was verylow when taking into account various factors such as economic growth and inflation prospects." Kim said. Kim voiced optimism that the global economy would continueto grow, but singled out Europe's fiscal problems as the mainrisk and said more financial market turbulence was possible. This, combined with assurances that even after this week'srate rise monetary policy would remain accommodative, suggestedthat any further tightening would be cautious. "As the base rate is still very low and the pace oftightening is very gradual, it is supportive for the economyand the impact on the market won't be negative," said LeeSung-kwon, economist at Shinhan Investment Corporation. Since mid-April, world financial markets have been doggedby concerns about the impact of Europe's austerity drive onglobal growth and fears that recovery from the worst economicdownturn in decades may stall and lead to a double-diprecession. This week's move was the first rate rise since August 2008and the first rate change since early last year when thecentral bank finished its easing campaign that shaved off atotal of 325 basis points of its benchmark rate.
