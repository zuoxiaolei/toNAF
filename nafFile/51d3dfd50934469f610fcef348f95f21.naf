<raw><![CDATA[   * Euro falls as sterling tumbles, Greece worry weighs * Pound falls most versus dollar since October 2009 * Canadian dollar outperforms on stronger growth data (Updates prices, adds comment, details) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - The euro fell against theU.S. dollar on Monday, led by a sharp sell-off in sterling andlingering uncertainty over a bailout for debt-strapped Greece. The pound hit a 10-month low versus the dollar and was ontrack for its biggest one-day drop since October after a pollshowed increased risk that no party will win a majority in thisyear's general election, making it difficult to take toughaction to reduce Britain's debt.

Having broken through the key $1.50 level, the pounddropped roughly 3 percent at one point, with traders citingselling by a UK bank after UK insurer Prudential Plc said it would buy American International Group Inc's Asian life insurance business. The euro had steadied earlier in the global session onhopes Greece may be nearing a deal with EU governments to getsome form of emergency aid, although analysts said the lack ofconcrete developments suggests the currency remains fragile. "It's continued concern about sovereign risk both for theeuro and the pound," said Sophia Drossos, co-head of globalcurrency strategy at Morgan Stanley in New York. "Thesesovereign risk issues are not going to go away very quickly." In midday trading, the euro  fell 0.8 percent to$1.3523 after hitting a session low of $1.3461, according toReuters data, not far from a nine-month low of $1.3442 lastmonth. The pound  traded 1.7 percent lower at $1.4993. Atcurrent prices, it's on track for its biggest one-day declinesince late October 2009. It had tumbled as low as $1.4781. "Political uncertainty now is adding to an already cloudedoutlook for the pound," said Omer Esiner, senior market analystfor Travelex Global Business Payments in Washington. "The poundhas been significantly undermined by UK's lackluster economicrecovery as well as the possibility of additional credit easingfrom the Bank of England." Market participants also used weaker-than-expected data onUK mortgage approvals as another reason to knock the pound to athree-month low against the euro . EURO SHORT POSITIONS The euro had been helped by speculation that a visit by EUEconomic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn and European CentralBank Executive Board member Juergen Stark to Athens could moveEU governments closer to a deal. [ID:nLDE6200RI] But uncertainty remained over whether the other governmentswill agree on support as German Chancellor Angela Merkelstressed that no decision had been taken. [ID:nLDE61R0BX] Traders said sentiment on the euro remained negative. Datafrom the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed net shorteuro positions rose to a record in the week to Feb. 23.[IMM/FX] Sharp losses in the euro and sterling helped lift the ICEFutures U.S. dollar index , which tracks the greenbackversus a basket of six other major currencies. The index was up0.7 percent at 80.890. Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.5 percent to 89.27 yen. The Canadian dollar rose, with the greenback falling 1percent to C$1.0419 after data showed Canada's quarterlyeconomic growth beat estimates. [ID:nN01247443] "We had very strong growth data for (the fourth quarter)from Canada today, making it clear that growth continues torecover and suggesting that the Bank of Canada might have toexit its policy accommodation sooner rather than later," MorganStanley's Drossos said. Central banks in the euro zone as well as Britain, Canadaand Australia all have monetary policy meetings this week. (Editing by James Dalgleish)             ]]></raw>
