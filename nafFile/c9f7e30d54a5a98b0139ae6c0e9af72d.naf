<raw><![CDATA[ * BOJ to decide corporate funding exit on Oct. 30 or later. * BOJ upgrades economic view, says economy is recovering * Keeps rates on hold at 0.1 pct as expected * BOJ says govt promised to respect its independence * Fujii disagrees with BOJ's view of economy (Updates after Fujii news conference) By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan deferred adecision on Wednesday on withdrawing support for corporatefinance after the government pressed the central bank to considerthe economic cost of its retreat from credit markets. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii kept up the pressure afterthe BOJ announcement, saying the central bank's view of theeconomy was too rosy. The BOJ had been tipped to announce it would end corporatebond purchases and other measures used to cushion the shock ofthe financial crisis, joining other central banks in rolling backtheir emergency response to the turmoil of the past two years. Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the decision could be takenat the next meeting on Oct. 30 or even later, and suggested thedebate was more about the timing of the exit. "What to do about various emergency measures in place now isa technical issue," Shirakawa told reporters after the BOJ'stwo-day policy review at which it kept interest rates on hold at0.1 percent. The decision is largely inconsequential for the corporatefinance market which has mostly recovered from the crisis. But the political pressure on the central bank meant theoutcome may define its relationship with a new government, stillfumbling with the levers of power in the world's second largesteconomy. Although Japan's economy crawled out of its worst everrecession in the second quarter, the government is worried aboutrising unemployment, particularly among small firms that employabout 70 percent of the country's workforce. "It is not a matter of whether the temporary measures arehaving their intended effect but whether the BOJ's possible exitwill give the impression to markets that the bank is movingtowards tightening," said Seiji Adachi, senior economist atDeutsche Securities. Shirakawa appeared to acknowledge those concerns. "There's no change in our stance of keeping interest ratesvery low and providing ample liquidity to markets," he said. RECOVERY The BOJ upgraded its view on the economy, saying it wasrecovering and maintained its assessment that financialconditions were increasingly showing signs of improvement. Fujii disagreed. "The BOJ is looking at financial and other conditions in itsown way, but it would be right to judge the situation as moresevere overall than it thinks," he told a news conference. The overt pressure raises questions about how the government,formed six weeks ago after an election ended half a century ofalmost uninterrupted Liberal Democrat rule, would deal with theBOJ which formally became independent a decade ago. "I think the BOJ yielded to the pressure and thought itwasn't the time to send a signal that they will withdrawstimulus," said Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief investment strategist atSJS Markets in Hong Kong. The perception that a central bank is bowing to politicalpressure could make it difficult to manage market expectationsand eventually undermine confidence in the currency. Shirakawa dismissed any suggestion the central bank hadyielded to the government, which sends finance ministryrepresentatives to BOJ board meetings. "They said the government will respect the BOJ's independencebased on rules stated in the BOJ Law, and said it hopes toclosely communicate with the central bank," he said. Shirakawa had signalled an exit strategy was being workedout, telling reporters at a Group of Seven meeting of financialleaders on Oct. 3 that corporate finance needed less policysupport as credit markets had improved significantly. The Nikkei business daily reported on Oct. 6 that the BOJ wasconsidering ending its outright buying of commercial paper andcorporate bonds at the end of this year and was likely to decideby Oct. 30, the date of its next review. The central bank came under pressure from governmentofficials not to move too soon. Fujii said last week he was concerned that the economy wasstill unstable.  National Strategy Minister Naoto Kan and BankingMinister Shizuka Kamei also urged the central bank to considerthe economic cost of its decision after Nikkei report. "Japan's economy has only just begun showing signs of pickingup. What we need to do is to patiently maintain easy monetaryconditions to achieve sustained economic growth," Shirakawa said. "On the other hand, there is a general understanding thatwhat to do about measures in place to deal with the post-Lehmancrisis is a different issue from debates about an exit strategy,"he said. "We will review these steps in line with improvements infinancial markets." Debt issuance has come back to life and credit spreads haveshrunk considerably since the BOJ stepped into the corporatefinance markets. The cost of insuring a basket of Japanese companies' debtwith credit default swaps has shrunk to around 115 basis pointsfrom its peak of 550 basis points in March.
