<raw><![CDATA[ * HK shares rise despite China move before holidays * AUD retreats, but returning risk appetite gives support * Caution over Greece debt problem caps euro gains By Satomi Noguchi TOKYO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The euro steadied on Wednesday tohold sharp gains made the previous day against the dollar asinvestors cut short positions on views that the fall in the euroover Greece's debt problems had run its course. The euro had shed as much as 10 percent since late 2009 atone point as worries over whether Greece could service its debtmounted, and currency speculators later reversed record shorteuro positions they had built into last week. The euro's rebound came in tandem with a sharp pull back inthe dollar's upward momentum versus other major currencies,including the Australian dollar, with charts suggesting more roomfor the greenback to slip, market players said. Investors sold the Aussie to take profits from the currency'sclimb the day before, but the Hong Kong stock market rose despiteChina's move before the Lunar New Year holidays to raise bankreserves for the second time this year, feeding a return of riskappetite among investors and providing support to the Aussie. "I see this euro's rebound as a temporary break from itslonger-term downward trend. But its corrective move up couldcontinue until early next week when Chinese markets resumefull-fledged activity," said Hideki Amikura, deputy generalmanager of the forex section at Nomura Trust bank. The Hong Kong market reopend on Wednesday, while Shanghai'smarket resumes trading on Monday. "The euro could recover to as much as above $1.3900 in thiscorrective session," Amikura added. The euro was changing hands at $1.3765, steady from late NewYork trade on Tuesday when it posted its sharpest daily risesince July and jumped as high as $1.3780 on trading platform EBS,the highest in about a week. Traders saw resistance for the euro around $1.3850, a tadabove last week's high at $1.3840. But its rise above thoselevels on the other hand could accelerate the euro's rebound,traders said. The dollar index, a gauge for the greenback's performanceagainst another six major currencies, was little changed at79.688, a touch above Tuesday's low of 79.593. Analysts said technical signs pointed to the dollar indexseeing a deeper pullback from its run up to a seven-month high of80.748 on Friday, once it breaks below mid-79. But investors were still cautious amid uncertainty overwhether Greece's debt problem will be solved quickly. Market players said the euro remained highly sensitive to anymore negative news on Greece. European finance ministers said on Tuesday that Greece shouldpresent a report by March 16 setting out a timetable for theimplementation of budget target measures for 2010, and another byMay 15 setting out policy measures needed to comply with thefinance ministers' decision. Quarterly reports will be requiredfrom then on. The Australian dollar slipped 0.1 percent to $0.9008 withinvestors booking profits from its climb as high as $0.9028 theprevious day, its highest since late January. The Aussie remained supported by comments by the Reserve Bankof Australia (RBA) on Tuesday that more rises in interest ratesin Australia were likely this year as well as gains incommodities. The euro was up 0.2 percent against the yen at 124.40 yenafter climbing over 1.5 percent the previous day to as high as124.48 yen on EBS, its highest in about two weeks. The dollar rose to 90.36 yen, up 0.2 percent from late U.S.trade on Tuesday when it climbed as far as 90.52 on EBS, itshighest since Feb. 4.
