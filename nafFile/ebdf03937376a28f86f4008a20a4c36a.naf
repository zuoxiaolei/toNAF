The U.S. dollar also rose against sterling, with GBP/USD shedding 0.91% to reach 1.4912, after Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, delivered a cautious pre-election budget, ruling out "shortsighted" spending cuts in favor of securing a strong recovery.In addition, the greenback surged against the yen and Swiss franc, with USD/JPY jumping a staggering 1.73% to reach 91.96 and USD/CHF surging 1.04% to hit 1.0683.The U.S. dollar also rose against its Australian, Canadian and New Zealand counterparts: AUD/USD tumbled 0.96% to hit 0.91, USD/CAD rose 0.94% to hit 1.0253 and NZD/USD dropped 0.65% to reach 0.7028.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 1.16%.Also Wednesday, a government report showed that sales of new U.S. homes fell in February to a record low, defying forecasts, as foreclosures, blizzards and unemployment depressed the market.
