<raw><![CDATA[ * Too soon for ministers to call a deal in 2010 * Gaps wider now than in July 2008  (Recasts with council meeting mood, new chairs) By Jonathan Lynn GENEVA, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Gloom and frustration pervadedthe World Trade Organization on Monday as the prospects ofcompleting a new global commerce pact this year receded. The WTO's 153 members had agreed to take stock at the end ofMarch on whether the eight-year-old Doha round could beconcluded this year, as called for by political leaders. But WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy told the generalcouncil there were too many gaps and uncertainties in thenegotiations to bring in ministers at this point. Lamy said the decision on whether the Doha talks could becompleted this year was a political one to be taken byministers. "Given where we are right now, it is also clear, however,that the end of March is too early for that," he said incomments confirming a Reuters report last week. The decision prompted an outpouring of gloom by delegates,even as they pointed to advances in some technical aspects ofthe multifaceted negotiations.  DESPONDENT Egypt said the talks had made no tangible progress since anabortive meeting of ministers in July 2008, and were now stuckin an abyss between rhetoric and reality. India's WTO ambassador, Ujal Singh Bhatia, told the councilthe prospects of reaching a deal in 2010 were now in question. Mexico's ambassador, Fernando de Mateo y Venturini, speakingin English, said he had learnt a new word last week --"despondent" -- though maybe "angst" was more appropriate. Gapsbetween countries were now wider than in July 2008, he said. Unless negotiators worked to narrow them and produced a dealfor ministers to close, they risked facing the alternatives ofsuspending the talks or seeing them fade away, undermining theglobal trading system, he said. Lamy said WTO members would take stock of the Doha talks onMarch 29 and 30, after which ambassadors and senior officialsfrom national capitals would report back to ministers anddiscuss the next steps, which would need political guidance. To prepare for the stocktaking and identify the outstandinggaps, the senior ambassadors who chair different aspects of thenegotiations will prepare factual reports, while countriesholding bilateral talks -- such as the United States and thethree big emerging economies of Brazil, India and China -- willalso report back, he said. A Doha deal would cut rich country agricultural subsidiesthat distort global farm trade, open up emerging economies'markets for industrial goods and help developing countriesprosper through more trade. But the continuing rise in unemployment, even as the worldpulls out of the economic crisis, is making many countries havesecond thoughts about opening up to more trade, while Brazil,one of the keenest supporters of a deal, faces elections. In the United States labour unions fear a trade deal couldhurt jobs, even though the Obama administration is pointingincreasingly to exports as a way of regenerating the economy. Nepal said that least developed countries (LDCs) were payingthe price for failure to reach a deal, and called for an "earlyharvest" -- a call which drew support from China. This would involve agreeing on and implementing measures ofdirect concern to LDCs -- such as duty-free and quota-freeaccess for their goods in other markets, big cuts in cottonsubsidies and a deal to help them trade more by cutting red tapeand corruption and improving infrastructure -- while the rest ofthe negotiations continue. The council also agreed on people to head its main bodies inthe coming difficult year, including Canadian ambassador JohnGero to chair the general council and Nigerian ambassador YonovFrederick Agah to chair the dispute settlement body, as forecasttwo weeks ago by Reuters.
