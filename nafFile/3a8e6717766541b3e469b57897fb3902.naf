<raw><![CDATA[ * U.S. dollar gains; rate differentials to weigh * U.S. debt limit seen pressuring dollar * Euro, Aussie may pullback further vs yen (Updates prices, adds quotes, changes byline)  By Julie Haviv  NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - The dollar paused from lastweek's sharp decline against the euro on Monday, but a strongbearish stance toward the greenback is seen persisting ahead ofnext month's U.S. debt limit debate and on global central bankmonetary policy disparities. The dollar found support after a U.S. government shutdownwas averted on Friday, and the dollar's rise was widely viewedas overdue after its sell-off versus the euro for the last fourmonths. So far in April the dollar is still down more than 2percent. Interest rate differentials between Europe and the UnitedStates, however, are expected to continue to support the eurofollowing the European Central Bank's 25 basis point rate hikelast week. "The euro's drop today is nothing more than white noise,and the pullback should prove shallow," said Jessica Hoversen,foreign exchange and fixed income analyst at MF Global in NewYork. The dollar's negative tone should remain in place as longas the U.S. Federal Reserve keeps interest rates low and whilecentral banks abroad, namely the ECB and Bank of England, movecloser to more normal borrowing costs, she said. Even so, Hoversen said the euro will ultimately head lowerthis year, particularly after Portugal last week soughtfinancial aid from the European Union and the InternationalMonetary Fund. "The ECB rate hikes are going to torpedo the fiscally weakperipheral nations such as Spain, in terms of higher bankfunding and mortgage costs," she said. Risk reversals for one-month euro/dollar options are stillshowing a solid bias for "puts" this year, though the currencyhas rallied 8 percent so far in 2011. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For graphic on euro/dollar spot rate:http://r.reuters.com/hyz88r ECB in graphics: http://r.reuters.com/kah88r The euro zone's debt struggle: http://r.reuters.com/hyb65p^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Inflation data, meanwhile, could potentially sway currencysentiment this week, with Germany, Spain, Hungary, Sweden andthe United Kingdom all releasing reports on Tuesday. In theUnited States, inflation data will be released on Thursday andFriday. DOLLAR WEIGHED BY DEBT CEILING Currency traders have also started to talk about the U.S.government debt hitting its limit in a month's time, a scenariowhich should renew pressure on the dollar. "We're having some sort of relief rally after the U.S.government did not shut down as feared," said David Watt,senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto."But I think gains in the dollar will be limited because thefocus will be on the U.S. debt limit." The United States is $95 billion away from reaching thestatutory $14.3 trillion ceiling, according to the latestdata. In early afternoon New York trading, the euro  fell0.2 percent to $1.4442, after hitting a 15-month high around$1.4486 on Friday. The high on electronic trading platform EBSwas $1.4485. The yen, meanwhile, was off an 11-month low against theeuro and a 2-1/2-year trough versus the Australian dollar asyet another earthquake in Japan led some investors to parebearish bets against the country's currency. A fresh strong aftershock hit Japan on Monday, while theevacuation zone around its crippled nuclear plant was expandedbecause of high levels of radiation. For more see[ID:nL3E7FA058]. The euro was down 0.4 percent at 122.24 yen ,after trading as high as 123.33 yen earlier on trading platform EBS. The Australian dollar was down 0.3 percent at 89.15 yen, having scaled a high of 90.04 yen, its strongestsince September 2008. Technical indicators such as the 14-day relative strengthindex and slow stochastics also suggested that the euro andAustralian dollar are in overbought territory against the yen,pointing to the possibility of a near-term pull-back.
