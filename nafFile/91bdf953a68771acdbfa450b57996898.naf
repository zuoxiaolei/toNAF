European shares recorded a fifth straight day of gains, withthe FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares rising 0.5percent. Britain's FTSE100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC-40climbed between 0.5 percent and 0.9 percent. Reassuring quarterly earnings from JPMorgan, Goldman Sachsand Intel have boosted hopes about an economic recovery,although there were signs of some caution on bond and currencymarkets ahead of results from Bank of America, General Electricand Citi. MSCI global equities index, which has gained 6.5 percent sofar this week on corporate earnings results, was up 0.2 percentafter touching its highest level since June 15. Emerging stocks also hit a one-month peak. "The markets have been given a much needed shot in the armby the encouraging set of numbers coming out from the bankingsector," said Owen Ireland, analyst at ODL Securities in London. "Whilst confidence levels can often be about perception, thereality is that we have seen a consistent set of results fromsome of the worlds' largest institutions." Banks were among top gainers, with HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds,BNP Paribas and Societe Generale gaining from 0.1 percent to 1.5percent. U.S. stocks rallied for a fourth day on Thursday afterstrong results from major U.S. bank JPMorgan. Japan's Nikkeiclosed up 0.6 percent on Friday, but gains were capped bypolitical uncertainty ahead of an election next month. Some analysts said that it was too early to be overlyoptimistic about the global economy as data was still ringingwarning bells and some companies face a liquidity crunch. A survey showed on Thursday that factory activity in theU.S. Mid-Atlantic region contracted for a 10th consecutive monthin July, posting a worse than expected decline. CIT Group Inc was in discussions on Thursday with potentiallenders to secure financing, after the collapse of rescue talkswith the government left the 101-year-old U.S. lender tohundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses onthe brink of bankruptcy. "The market is looking for good news and it is interpretingeverything as good news. Whether it is interpreting itcorrectly, I am not too sure," said Justin Urquhart Stewart,director at Seven Investment Management.

Theeuro was down 0.4 percent at $1.4090 and down 0.5 percent at131.95 yen.  Euro zone government bond futures pushed higher, catching abid after bomb blasts ripped through hotels in Indonesia and asinvestors fretted about the possible bankruptcy of CIT Group. Strategists, however, see the bond market losing some momentum as European equities rose. "Obviously we had a bounce back yesterday on the back ofdata and CIT news and that flowed through today given events inIndonesia," said Sean Maloney, interest rate strategist atNomura in London.  "We have seen a little bit of safety bid but not surethere's going to be a lot to push it higher ... We have a lot ofearnings coming out from the U.S. today and that's going to bethe main focus," he said. The Bund future was 28 ticks up at 121.76 compared with121.48 at Thursday's settlement close. In the cash market,10-year Bunds yielded 3.331 percent, up slightly  from levels inlate Thursday trade.
