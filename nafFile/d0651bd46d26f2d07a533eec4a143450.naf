<raw><![CDATA[ * UK Jan CPI seen soaring to 4 pct, highest since late 2008 * BoE's King forced to pen 10th public letter of explanation * Central bank's credibility under scrutiny  By Christina Fincher LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Britain's January inflationnumbers will make difficult reading for the Bank of England at atime when its inflation-fighting credentials are increasinglycoming into question. Figures at 0930 GMT are forecast to show annual consumerprice inflation surged to 4.0 percent from 3.7 percent inDecember, its highest level since November 2008 and double thecentral bank's target. Retail price inflation, which some economists consider amore accurate gauge of the cost of living, is forecast to riseeven higher, to 5.1 percent.  Britain's central bank is nervous that an interest rate risecould snuff out a fragile economic recovery. It has kept ratesat a record low 0.5 percent for almost two years, arguing thatinflation was being driven by one-off factors such as rises insales tax, currency weakness and spikes in commodity prices. Building price pressures, however, have encouraged investorsto bet that an interest rate rise will not be long in coming.Money markets are pricing in a quarter-point rate rise by May,and at least one more by the end of the year.  "Given UK markets' current sensitivity to inflation,January's release is a very important one," said Philip Shaw, aneconomist at Investec. Shaw believes retail price inflation could be as high as 5.5percent, a level not seen since 1991.  TAX CHANGES January's figures are more tricky to forecast than normalbecause they will be affected by several tax changes, thebiggest of which being the rise in VAT -- from 17.5 percent to20 percent -- on Jan. 4. It is hard to calculate in advance how much of that tax risewas passed on by retailers. Some may have raised prices ahead ofthat date while others may have decided to absorb some of thetax in a bid to lure in shoppers. Oil, commodity and food prices are all expected to have hada significant upward impact on the index last month. Inflation has now been at least a percentage point above theBoE's 2 percent target for an entire year, and Governor MervynKing will be forced to write another letter to the governmentexplaining what remedial action will be taken. That letter will be published at 1030 GMT, an hour after theinflation figures are released. King has so far blamed the rise in inflation on externalfactors, which he says the BoE can do nothing about, and one-offtax changes, whose effect on inflation will be temporary.  However, building pipeline pressures and growing concernsthe BoE is going soft on inflation mean King might adopt aharder stance. The BoE will publish new quarterly growth and inflationforecasts on Wednesday and investors will scruntinise King'scomments for clues on what those forecasts will hold. The BoE may be prepared to look through short-term pricepressures but any indication that medium-term price pressuresare rising would be seen as a signal that rates will rise soonerrather than later.
