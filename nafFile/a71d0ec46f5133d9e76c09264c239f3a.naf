Aluminum maker Alcoa  will mark the unofficial startof the quarterly earnings season when it reports its earningsafter the market's close on Monday. Optimism about earningshelped offset concerns about Japan, which suffered anotherstrong aftershock and expanded the evacuation zone around itscrippled nuclear plant. The yen rebounded from an 11-month low against the euro anda 2-1/2 year trough versus the Australian dollar, after thelatest earthquake, with a magnitude 6.6, prompted someinvestors to unwind riskier bets often funded by cheapborrowing in the Japanese currency. "The good news for bulls as we enter earnings season isthat expectations appear to be low," said Todd Salamone, seniorvice president of research at Schaeffer's Investment Researchin Cincinnati, Ohio. The Dow Jones industrial average  was up 42.46points, or 0.34 percent, at 12,421.68. The Standard & Poor's500 Index  was up 1.96 points, or 0.15 percent, at1,330.15. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was off 3.65points, or 0.13 percent at 2776.95. World stocks as measured by MSCI  were flat,with emerging markets  off 0.5 percent. Although the world economy is fairly robust, there aregrowing expectations among investors that accompanying highercommodity prices will drive up inflation and prompt centralbanks to tighten monetary policy sooner. European stocks fell  The FTSEurofirst 300  indexof top European shares was down slightly. Brent crude oil earlier fell by more than $1 on Monday tobelow $125 but has since retraced some of its losses movingabove $126 a barrel and U.S. crude futures slipped under $112,giving back some ground after Friday's strong rally. The African Union said Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi hadaccepted a roadmap to end the civil war in Libya, including animmediate ceasefire, but an opposition representative said itwould only work if Gaddafi left power. ICE Brent crude for May  was last down 57 cents at$126.09 a barrel after hitting an intraday low of $124.69 abarrel, down almost $2. U.S. crude for May delivery  fell74 cents to $112.05 a barrel. YEN GAINS The euro touched its highest against the yen since May 2010of 123.33 yen  on trading platform EBS. It later gaveup gains and was last down 0.5 percent at 122.13 yen. Traders said speculator positioning and some technicalindicators suggested that recent rallies in the euro and theAustralian dollar against the yen could pause in the short run,with the latest in a series of quakes being used by some tobook profits. The euro fell 0.2 percent versus the dollar to $1.4450, having hit a 15-month high of $1.4489 on Friday. The dollar rebounded after steep losses on Friday, as theU.S. government averted a potential shutdown, although analystssaid the focus on the debt ceiling debate could limit thegreenback's gains. "We're having some sort of relief rally after the U.S.government did not shut down as feared," said David Watt,senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. Expectations of another rise in European Central Bankinterest rates by July kept the euro close to recent highs andpushed euro zone government bond prices lower. German Bund yields  briefly rose above 3.5percent from the first time since August 2009. The ECB raised its benchmark rate by 25 basis points lastweek to 1.25 percent, the first hike since 2008, and usedlanguage suggesting that another rise is in the pipeline.
