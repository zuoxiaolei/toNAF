<raw><![CDATA[ * Nomura forms ETF marketing team, hires two from BlackRock * Aims to boost foreign ETF offerings to 60 from 42 by March * Sees overall Japan ETF market doubling in 3 years By Chikafumi Hodo TOKYO, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings plans to add moreforeign and domestic exchange traded funds to its line-up inJapan, eyeing growth in a market it hopes will double in threeyears, an executive at Japan's largest brokerage said. Nomura has recently established a team dedicated to marketingETFs, aiming to attract a wider range of retail and institutionalinvestors and stoke growth in Japan's ETF market, which hasshrunk 12 percent since peaking at around $35 billion in 2006. "The number of ETFs listed on Japanese exchanges hasincreased over the last three years, but we think thingsshouldn't end there. We need to make a better effort to attractmore investors," Makoto Shiota, head of the ETF market group atNomura Securities, told Reuters in an interview. Shiota manages a team of six, including two former executivesof the Japanese unit of BlackRock Inc, the world's top ETFprovider. The global ETF market size has expanded by more than 10 timesto $1.24 trillion in total assets in October, from $104.8 billionnine years ago, according to data by BlackRock. The Japanese ETF industry has also expanded rapidly over thepast decade. Assets totalled $30.5 billion in October, up from$6.6 billion in 2001, though down from a peak of $34.6 billion in2006, BlackRock data showed. ETFs are popular among passive investors as it is acost-effective way to get exposure to benchmark indicies, such asJapan's Nikkei stock average and Brazil's Bovespa index, as wellas commodities like gold and oil. Nomura hopes to gain more attention from traditional retailinvestors and institutions by offering a variety of ETFs. Nomura plans to increase the distribution of foreign ETFs to60 by the end of March from 42 now, focusing mainly on foreignbond funds, Shiota said. ETFs linked to Japanese government bonds could also drawinterest from foreign investors, Shiota said, adding that itwould be suitable for the broker's asset management arm, NomuraAsset Management, to launch one over the long-term. Nomura believes the Japanese ETF market could double to 5trillion yen in three years from the current 2.5 trillion yen,helped by news that Japan Post Bank (Yucho), the world's biggestbank, and Japan's central bank were investing in ETFs. "The BOJ will use ETFs in their (money market) operations andYucho will also treat ETFs as an investment tool. These moves areextremely important," Shiota said. Japan Post Bank was reported to have invested about 50billion yen in ETFs of emerging market equities, while the BOJset up a 5 trillion yen asset buying scheme in November thatincluded the purchase of ETFs.
