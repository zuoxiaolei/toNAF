<raw><![CDATA[ * Dlr hits 14-yr low vs yen as Tokyo says won't intervene * Gold punches new high on dollar weakness * Asian shares weak as investors digest mixed data * European shares set to open lower By Susan Fenton HONG KONG, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The dollar slumped to a14-year low against the yen on Thursday, helping gold scaleanother record high, while Asian stocks faltered as investorsdigested a mixed batch of economic data. Financial bookmakers expected European stockmarkets to openlower while U.S. markets will be closed for the Thanksgivingholiday. The dollar skidded below 87 yen to its lowest level sinceJuly 1995 as Japan said it was not planning to intervene in themarket. It also hit a 15-month low against a basket ofcurrencies as investors betted on prolonged weakness in theworld's reserve currency. Gold punched a new record above $1,192.60 an ounce onexpectations more central banks would buy the precious metal todiversify away from the dollar, which has lost more than 8percent against major currencies this year and is heading forits biggest yearly slide in six years. Investors also sought out the Swiss franc as a safe way todiversify, pushing the currency to an 18-month high althoughanalysts expected the Swiss authorities to intervene onceEuropean markets opened. Deputy Japanese finance minister Yoshihiko Noda toldReuters that Tokyo was not planning to intervene in the marketto rein in the yen. That helped depress shares of Japaneseexporters and pushed Tokyo's Nikkei stock index down 0.6percent to a four-month low. "This will contribute still further to the currentinvestors' shunning of Japan. If there were signs that themajor problems were being dealt with things might get better,but as they are now it's pretty hard," said Noritsugu Hirakawa,a strategist at Okasan Securities in Tokyo. Japan is back in deflation and the steel industryfederation said the current yen rate could push Japan back intorecession and urged the authorities to rein in the currency. DISMAL START FOR MINSHENG IPO Equity markets across Asia were subdued ahead ofThanksgiving holiday and as investors digested mixed economicdata. U.S. jobless claims fell to the lowest in more than a yearlast week and consumer spending and home sales rose more thanexpected in October but durable goods orders unexpectedly felllast month. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks traded outside Japanwas down 0.7 percent and the Thomson Reuters index of regionalshares was 1 percent lower. Shares in China slumped more than 3 percent as bankingstocks fell on concerns about shrinking lending and possibleneeds to raise capital. That dampened the Hong Kong trading debut of China'sMinsheng Bank, the country's seventh-largest lender. The $3.9billion issue, the world's fifth-biggest IPO so far this year,saw Minsheng shares fall to as low as HK$8.95 from an offerprice of HK$9.08. Friday marks the start of the U.S. Christmas holidayshopping season and will provide a key indicator of demand forAsian exports in the final months of the year. Asia-Pacific stock markets outside Japan have alreadyrallied nearly 70 percent this year, making investors cautiousas the year-end nears. However, analysts say the region stilllooks a good bet compared with other parts of the world asWestern consumer demand remains fragile. The Middle East has also lost some of its shine with Dubaion Wednesday reporting that two of its flagship firms plannedto delay repayment on billions of dollars of debt. The Australian dollar held firm as a rate rise still lookedto be on the cards next week after data showed a sharp upgradein Australian business spending plans even though investmentunexpectedly slipped last quarter. "For the Reserve Bank (of Australia), rates at these levelsare too low and we anticipate a move upwards in December of 25basis points," said Andrew Hanlan, senior economist at Westpacin Australia. In Vietnam, the dong currency was quoted near its new lowpoint against the dollar after the central bank devalued thecurrency by more than 5 percent on Wednesday and narrowed itstrading band.
