<raw><![CDATA[ * Baghdad in talks with Syria, Egypt for electricity imports * Considers connecting to regional power grid link * Iraq sees electricity shortfall this summer  By Rania El Gamal and Aseel Kami BAGHDAD, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Iraq has been unable, due to U.S.sanctions, to pay Iran millions of dollars owed for electricity,an Iraqi official said, potentially damaging its efforts tosupply enough power to a population suffering chronic shortages. Iraq imports 650 megawatts of electricity from Iran andplans to boost imports to around 1,000 MW this year, Adel Mahdi,an adviser in the electricity ministry, said on Wednesday. But due to U.S. sanctions against Tehran over its nuclearprogramme, foreign banks have refused to transfer at least $200million of overdue payments to Iran, raising fears among Iraqiofficials that a cheap and vital power supply could be cut aheadof the sizzling Iraqi summer. "I fear an indirect effect, that by summer maybe the debt onus will be half a billion (dollars) and at that time they (Iran)have peak demand... they could say 'we will have to eliminatethe contract and stop'," Mahdi said in an interview. "That would cause a very big problem to Iraq." He said last year Iraq's peak power supply was about6,500-7,000 MW, and demand was estimated at 14,000 MW during thesummer when temperatures frequently exceed 50 Celsius and airconditioning units run constantly. In 2011, supply is expected to rise to around 8,000 MW asnew power plants and turbines go online. But demand is also expected to increase to more than 15,000MW as the country rebuilds an economy and infrastructure damagedby war, Mahdi said. "The demand is still rising at high levels, the annualdemand growth is around 8 to 10 percent," he said, "... whichmeans this year... the shortfall will remain at around 50percent." Additional generation would remain limited in 2012 butpeople would start noticing a large increase the following year,he said. Last summer, days of protests in the Shi'ite south overcrippling power cuts forced the then electricity minister tostep down. The former oil minister, Hussain al-Shahristani, isserving as acting electricity minister. Seven years after the U.S.-led invasion, Iraq's nationalgrid still only supplies a few hours of power each day andintermittent electricity is one of the public's top complaints. Struggling to meet demand, Iraq is considering connecting toa regional power grid link, Mahdi said. "There are positive indications from both the Syrian andEgyptian sides," Mahdi said. "We need negotiations with Jordanand Syria, and to complete the required... installation oftransmission lines." The regional power grid link is intended to have a capacityto provide each member with more than 500 MW and connect Egypt,Libya, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Turkey and Iraq, hesaid. Iraq is also in talks with Syria over electricity importsthis summer through an old link, with a capacity of 70 MW, tothe northern Iraqi city of Mosul, he said.             ]]></raw>
