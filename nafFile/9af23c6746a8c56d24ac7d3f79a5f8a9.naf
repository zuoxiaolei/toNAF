The Panama Canal Authority announced a consortium dominatedby the two companies had won the $3 billion contract afterEuropean markets closed on Wednesday. The contract -- the biggest of its kind in Latin America --will be signed in the next four weeks, Impregilo said in astatement. Rival bidders have eight days to review and challengethe decision, the authority said.
