<raw><![CDATA[ By Emma Graham-Harrison COPENHAGEN, Dec 15 (Reuters) - A top Chinese diplomat warneddeveloped countries on Tuesday against using climate change asan excuse to set up trade barriers, potentially raising a newhurdle to reaching a deal at UN-led climate negotiations. Yu Qingtai, China's climate change ambassador, said richnations should not think that slapping carbon tariffs on importsfrom countries with different emissions control regimes wouldsubstitute for reaching a global deal to tackle warming. His comments came shortly after China said that Premier WenJiabao would leave for Copenhagen on Wednesday afternoon,suggesting he would arrive earlier than previously planned andadding extra political impetus for a deal. With just three days left before the deadline for a globalagreement, delegates have struggled to bridge rifts between richand poor nations, particularly over funding to help poor nationscurb global warming and deal with its impact.  Carbon border tariffs -- fees on imports from countriesperceived as weak on cutting emissions -- have long beendenounced by China, but trade has not been a high profile issueat negotiations so far, even though any substantial deal wouldbring major economic shifts. "We oppose the actions of any country that sets up new tradebarriers under the excuse of protecting the planet," Yu said,when asked about trade concerns at the talks. "The attempt to resolve the issues in multilateralnegotiations by taking unilateral trade steps will not succeed,"Yu said, adding that history showed protectionism damaged thosewho espoused it as well as their targets. Lawmakers in parts of the United States that produce cement,chemicals, steel and other energy-intensive products, havecalled for carbon tariffs in any climate legislation.  Experts fear climate could add yet another layer of discordinto complicated U.S. trade relations with China. The two arealready at odds over Chinese tires and U.S. exports of poultryand auto products. However if Washington and Beijing can reach agreement onanother area which has been a key bone of contention --monitoring China's promised emissions curbs -- it couldpotentially smooth the way to avoiding a showdown over trade. If China's emissions efforts are measured and verified, U.S.lawmakers might be slower to impose tariffs on its imports. Yu confirmed China's delegation was having many bilateraltalks with other parties. He declined to say if they were withthe United States, but NGOs said a deal could be in sight. "Both sides have been having extensive consultations on thisissue for the past several months, and it seems like they mayhave laid the groundwork for some kind of compromise, whichcould break the impasse," said Ailun Yang of Greenpeace China.
