<raw><![CDATA[ (Updates prices)	 * Swiss franc trims gain after hitting record high vs dollarand euro * Euro zone debt market tensions, global growth fearsdominate * Intervention worries keep dollar/yen relatively steady * Aussie hit as markets dump risk assets By Masayuki Kitano	 SINGAPORE, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc hit recordhighs and the Australian dollar fell on Wednesday as investorsscrambled for a safe haven on renewed tensions in the euro zonedebt market and worries about a global slowdown.	 The yen held steady against the U.S. dollar, with investorswary of intervention to weaken the yen after recent jawboningfrom Japanese authorities. 	 Even Moody's affirmation of the United States' prizedtriple-A credit rating failed to calm jittery markets. Moody'sannouncement followed congressional approval of adeficit-cutting plan. 	 Instead, markets focused on Tuesday's announcement of moreweak U.S. data, following a batch of dour manufacturing surveyson Monday. Latest figures showed U.S. consumer spending droppedin June for the first time in nearly two years and incomesbarely rose.	 Adding to market jitters was a sell-off in peripheral eurozone bonds, which drove Italian bond yields to a 14-year high onTuesday.	 The souring mood saw investors make a beeline for safe-havenassets including the Swiss franc and gold, which also hit arecord high .	 "Given what we're seeing at the moment is safe haven demand,further Swiss franc strength is conceivable," said Gareth Berry,associate director of G10 FX strategy for UBS in Singapore.	  CAPITAL PRESERVATION	 "When it's all about capital preservation rather thanyields, strange things can happen in the currency space, andcurrencies like the Swiss franc can be pushed well beyond levelsthat are compatible with what economic fundamentals suggest,"Berry added.	 Earlier on Wednesday, the euro hit a record low of 1.0797versus the Swiss franc on trading platform EBS. The euro latertrimmed its losses and was last up 0.5 percent from late U.S.trading on Tuesday at 1.0889 francs .	 The dollar also trimmed losses against the Swiss franc afterhitting a record low of 0.7610 francs earlier on Wednesday. Thedollar last stood at 0.7659 versus the Swiss franc, up 0.5percent on the day.	 The dollar took a breather against the yen  in thewake of its recent drop close to a record low.	 "The market looks overly short in dollar/yen so it isdifficult for the market to sell further. The market isparticularly watching U.S. jobs data on Friday to see whether tosell further," said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager for OkasanSecurities in Tokyo.	 The dollar held steady against the yen at 77.16yen .  The dollar had hit a four-month low of76.29 yen earlier this week , right near a record lowof 76.25 yen in March, stirring jitters that Japaneseauthorities may intervene to curb the yen's rise.	 Another focal point is whether the Bank of Japan will easemonetary policy at a policy meeting later this week. Onepossible step may be to expand the size of the BOJ'sasset-buying scheme, which now stands at 10 trillion yen. 	 There is scepticism, however, about how effective Japanesesolo intervention would be and also regarding the potentialimpact of any BOJ monetary easing. 	 "The market is turning suspicious about seeing an effectiveyen-selling intervention as the Bank of Japan may not be able tocome up with strong monetary easing measures," said Soma atOkasan Securities.	 The euro edged up 0.1 percent against the dollarto $1.4214 .	  TOLL ON RISKIER ASSETS	 Heightened risk aversion took a heavy toll on riskierassets, with stocks and commodity currencies coming underpressure.	 "There certainly has been weaker numbers globally,particularly out of the U.S. There is already a high level ofuncertainty in global markets and that's another layer which isimpacting on sentiment," said Greg Gibbs, strategist at RBS inSydney.	 The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent to $1.0747 , pulling away from a 29-year high of $1.1081 hitlast week, with some investors wagering that interest rateswould have to be cut in Australia to avoid recession.	 Traders said a daily close below the $1.0775 area willsignal yet another failure at $1.1032-1.1083 major long-termresistance, a negative signal for the currency.	 The Australian dollar's drop came a day after the ReserveBank of Australia sounded less certain about the global economyand left interest rates unchanged.
