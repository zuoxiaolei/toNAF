<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar index moves between gains and losses year to date * Dollar rises to 2-week high vs yen, 1-wk high vs euro * Fed eyes gradual bond buys; several hundred bln dlrs-WSJ (Updates prices, adds comment, changes dateline, previousLONDON) NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against theeuro and yen on Wednesday, leaving the dollar index littlechanged year to date, as investors eased short bets against thecurrency ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting. While Fed meetings are always of paramount interest, thecoming statement is more anticipated than usual given thecentral banks has telegraphed several times that it will add tothe liquidity in the system to stoke economic growth throughadditional quantitative easing. The only questions now are by how much and whether the newmeasures will be implemented over time or phased in. With expectations that QE will be implemented in steps,some investors are more willing to take bets on the dollar ifit gains traction, the QE will bolster the economic outlookcompared with other regions such as the euro zone. And The Wall Street Journal reported the Fed would makebond purchases worth a few hundred billion dollars over severalmonths, which compared with investors' base-case scenario foran initial commitment to buy at least $500 billion. The dollar hit a two-week high against the yen and aone-week peak versus the euro, which was also knocked by eurozone banks taking up more cheap funding than expected at athree-month ECB tender. The greenback jumped against the Australian dollar too andhit a one-month high against the Swiss franc. "The dollar's slide since September has been pricing inaggressive price action by the Fed to around $1 trillion," saidOmer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth ForeignExchange. "Some stabilization, Fed official comments and theWall Street Journal article have resulted in investors paringback those aggressive expectations. Given the price action wecan assume they are trimming those short dollar bets." In a Reuters survey earlier this month, U.S. primarydealers' projections for the size of the Fed's expectedquantitative easing at its Nov. 2-3 policy meeting ranged from$500 billion to $1.5 trillion. In early New York trade, the euro was down 0.3 percent at$1.3820. It earlier fell as low as $1.3770 on electronictrading platform EBS as a break of an option barrier at $1.3800accelerated selling. The dollar trimmed gains versus the euro on Wednesday afterdata showing U.S. durable goods orders rose more than expectedin September, though they fell when transportation equipmentwas excluded. Traders reported central banks and other major playerslooking to buy the euro on dips below $1.38. Bids were expectedaround $1.3750/60. A break of $1.3750 could prompt a test oflast week's low around $1.3695. Many analysts believe the gap between euro zone and U.S.short-term rates, reflecting QE expectations from the Fed whilethe ECB gradually withdraws liquidity, will mean the euro isunlikely to fall below $1.35 in the next month or twoparticularly while investors wait to see the impact of the Fedmeasures. DOLLAR SUPPORTED The dollar index, which tracks the performance of thegreenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up0.2 percent at 77.864 and is moving back and forth betweenmarginal gains and losses for the year to date. Against the yen, the dollar rose as high as 81.99 yen onelectronic trading platform EBS, pulling further away from a15-year low of 80.41 yen struck earlier this week. It lasttraded at 81.60 yen. Traders said a fair amount of overnight 82.00 yen strikeswere bought on Tuesday, suggesting that area could act asresistance going into Wednesday's 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) cut --when many trades expire. Option-related stops were thenhighlighted at 82.15 yen. The Aussie dollar was down 1.3 percent at $0.9720, dentedby a smaller-than-expected rise in Australian consumer priceslast quarter which was seen as reducing the chances of futureinterest rate hikes. Spot yuan closed down against the dollar on Wednesday afterthe People's Bank of China set another weaker mid-point in amove seen aimed at curbing mounting speculation of further yuanappreciation..
