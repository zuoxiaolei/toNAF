<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen on Friday, ahead of the release of ky jobs data, as growing expectations for the Federal Reserve to soon scale back its stimulus program continued to support the greenback. USD/JPY hit 100.45 during early European trade, the pair's highest since July 3; the pair subsequently consolidated at 100.27, adding 0.24%. The pair was likely to find support at 99.26, the low of July 3 and resistance at 101.28, the high of May 31.  Investors were awaiting Friday’s closely watched U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for further clues on when the Federal Reserve may decide to unwind its USD85 billion-a-month stimulus program.Data on Wednesday showed that the U.S. private sector added 188,000 jobs in June, more than expectations for an increase of 160,000.  The yen was lower against the euro with EUR/JPY edging up 0.12%, to hit 129.32.  The single currency remained under pressure after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Thursday said the bank expects to maintain interest rates at current or lower levels for an “extended” period of time.Speaking at the bank’s post policy meeting press conference, Draghi said the decision to give forward guidance on interest rates was taken unanimously by policymakers and was “a very significant step forward” for the ECB.Draghi said risks to growth in the euro zone remain “on the downside” and added that monetary policy will remain accommodative for as long as is necessary.The comments came after the ECB left interest rates on hold at record lows of 0.5%.             ]]></raw>
