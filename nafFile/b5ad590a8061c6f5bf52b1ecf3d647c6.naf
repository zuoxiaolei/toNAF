<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen falls as S&P cuts Japan debt rating to AA-minus * Downgrade raises questions about other rich nations * ECB's Bini Smaghi: Can't ignore import goods inflation (Recasts; adds details, comment; updates prices) NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The yen slid against both thedollar and the euro on Thursday after Standard & Poor's cutJapan's long-term debt rating, a move that raised questionsabout the risks of downgrades for other developed economies. Although Japan's fiscal troubles are well known, analystssaid the downgrade called into question the yen's status as asafe-haven currency, boosting the appeal of the dollar and thelikes of the Swiss franc. S&P, in downgrading Japan to a rating of AA-minus, said thecountry's government lacked a coherent plan to tackle itsmounting debt. So far, analysts say Japan's situation is unlike that ofother nations, though at the very least it has raised questionsand sharpened the risk focus of sovereign wealth funds andother investors that might view the yen as a safe-havencurrency. The dollar was up 0.7 percent at 82.90 yen after risingmore than 1 percent to 83.22 on electronic trading platformEBS. The U.S. budget deficit is expected to blow out to a record$1.5 trillion this year, and debt worries in Europe havealready spurred financial rescues of Greece and Ireland. "It is reasonable to expect that the Japanese downgradewill raise concerns over the sovereign rating of the U.S.,"said Vasileios Gkionakis, macro strategist at Fulcrum AssetManagement LLP in London, which oversees $900 million inassets. Gkionakis, however, downplayed the risks to at least theUnited States, pointing out that U.S. gross domestic product isforecast to accelerate while Japan's will likely moderate. Inaddition, Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio is twice as high as that ofthe United States. And though deficits in both countries are large, the UnitedStates's is expected to improve more than Japan's, Gkionakissaid. "It's definitely a yen story," said William Reekstin,managing director with Direct Access Partners in New York."Japan had been on the watch list for a long time so it wasexpected. It's not the case for the U.S." Still, analysts said the euro may be better placed to gainagainst the yen than the dollar, given its better interest rateoutlook and concerns about the debt problems in the UnitedStates. Against the yen, the euro rose to 114.02 yen, its strongestsince Nov. 22, up around 1 percent on the day.     Othercurrencies may also be better placed, particularly the Swissfranc, which may now be the favored safe-haven currency. It hita high around 88.13 yen, its strongest since last April. EURO ACTION The euro was also boosted on Thursday by remarks by aEuropean Central Bank policy maker, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, whowarned that an expected rise in imported goods inflation cannotbe ignored, supporting the view that euro zone rates could risesooner than later. The comments helped the euro extend gains a day after theFederal Reserve in a policy statement gave no indication thatthe U.S. central bank may back away from its loose monetarypolicy, contrasting with the hawkish ECB rhetoric. "The ECB has started to show more concern about secondaryprice pressures, and the market has acknowledged that," saidGavin Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital. The euro rose to $1.3760 on EBS, its strongest since Nov.22, keeping intact a strong uptrend from a four-month low below$1.29 hit earlier in the month. It later eased to $1.3729, up0.1 percent on the day. The euro pierced resistance around $1.3740, the 61.8percent retracement of its two-month decline until earlyJanuary. Technical analysts said a daily close above that wouldadd to the positive tone. The next target is the Nov. 22 highof $1.3786, and some analysts say a break of this could promptmore gains towards $1.40.
