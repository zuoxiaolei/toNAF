<raw><![CDATA[ (Recasts throughout, adds Soskic quotes) By Gordana Filipovic BELGRADE, April 12 (Reuters) - Serbian central bank insiderDejan Soskic was officially nominated on Monday to be its nextgovernor and immediately stressed the need to stay focused onprice stability. Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic's announcement about Soskic,who has a strong academic background in economics, comes asSerbia is struggling to emerge from recession, inflation isrising and the dinar recently fell to an all-time low. Soskic, 43, head of the Serbian central bank's supervisoryboard, will replace Radovan Jelasic who resigned abruptly asgovernor last month after long arguing that Serbia had to livewithin its means. "The main challenge for Soskic is going to be to design themonetary policy at a time when the government undertakesmeasures to boost consumption that will create pressure oninflation," said Sasa Djogovic of the IZIT think tank. Soskic told Reuters after the announcement that monetarypolicy must remain focused on price stability. "Monetary policy must respect price stability, which is setin the law as the central bank's key mandate," he said. "As longas the law remains the same, there will be no compromise overthe price stability focus." "But monetary policy must also take into account a widermacroeconomic picture, including GDP growth and unemployment." Once the envy of the communist world as part of Yugoslavia,Serbia's economy remains smaller than before the 1990s wars.Belgrade's pro-European Union government is anxious to avoidsocial unrest by boosting spending after a period of recession. Serbia's economy shrank 1.6 percent year-on-year in the lastquarter of 2009, worse than the government had anticipated.Prime Minister Cvetkovic estimates unemployment will rise to asmuch as 17.5 percent from 14.5 percent this year. "It is important to have a central bank governor who is anexpert who knows the central bank well and Soskic is that kindof candidate," said Ivan Nikolic at Belgrade-based EconomicsInstitute think tank. "However, the future central bank governor must be awarethat the power of central bank monetary policy is limited andthat a lot depends on other players as inflation is fuelled bygovernment-controlled prices."  FALLING INTEREST RATES Under outgoing Governor Radovan Jelasic, the central banktwice lowered interest rates over the past month by a total of100 basis points. March retail price inflation was 7.4 percentyear-on-year, up from 6.3 percent in February. The International Monetary Fund is also closely watchingSerbia's spending as part of a three-billion euro loan package. Speaking on the sidelines of a conference, Cvetkovic saidthe government would submit the nomination of Soskic, who alsoteaches at the faculty of economics at the University ofBelgrade, for parliamentary approval, a process that could takeup to two months. "He fulfilled all basic criteria about non-party affiliationand professionalism," he said. Jelasic had faced growing political pressure to backpolicies to improve living standards, and criticism from somebusinesses as the dinar fell to a record low against the euro. Jelasic, 42, has joked that serving as Serbia's centralbanker was so stressful that it turned his once black hair greyduring his six years on the job.
