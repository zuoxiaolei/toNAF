<raw><![CDATA[ Position: Luxembourg Central bank governor Incumbent: Yves Mersch, date of birth Oct. 1, 1949 Term: 1998-present (currently in his third six-year term to2016) Key facts: -- Mersch has helped steer the bank's policy since its birthin 1998. Only his Dutch counterpart Nout Wellink and EuropeanCentral Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet can make similarclaims. -- He was in the running to become ECB vice-president in2010, but Portugal's Vitor Constancio was eventually chosen.Mersch was also mentioned as a long-shot candidate to succeedTrichet in the top ECB job after Germany's Axel Weber, thefront-runner, pulled out of the race. -- Jazz-loving Mersch is widely regarded as one of the ECB'smost hawkish or inflation-conscious policymakers. "Do I looklike a hawk? Is it the shape of my nose?" Mersch, a keen gymnastin his younger years, once joked in response to journalists'questions. -- Mersch has explained he is more sensitive to inflationdangers than other policymakers because Luxembourg wages areautomatically linked to inflation, risking a vicious spiral ofprices and wages feeding on each other. ECB observers rememberhis insistence that the central bank "walk the talk" by backingup rhetoric with action. -- Mersch has stressed that price stability is the bank'skey objective, but after the credit crunch struck in August2007, he adopted a less rigid stance, even more so after thefall of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.  -- Since May 2009, when rates dropped to a record low of 1.0percent, Mersch has talked about the negative side effectsassociated with very low rates, such as in the money markets,and their diminished marginal efficiency. -- He has also advocated an exit from the ECB's exceptionalmeasures saying repeatedly that there are signs of a broad-basedrecovery, that low interest rates encourage risk-taking and thatsuch measures tend to distort banks' decisions.
