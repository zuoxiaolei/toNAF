<raw><![CDATA[Aussie slips lower vs. dollar but losses limitedInvesting.com - The Australian dollar edged lower against its U.S. counterpart on Monday, as last week's upbeat U.S. jobs data continued to support demand for the greenback, although a strong report out of Australia still lent some support to the Aussie.AUD/USD hit 0.9342 during early European trade, the pair's lowest since July 3; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.9356, edging down 0.10%.The pair was likely to find support at 0.9323, the low of June 18 and resistance at 0.9408, the high of June 25.The greenback remained supported after official data last week showed that the U.S. economy added 288,000 jobs last month, well above expectations for jobs growth of 212,000, while the unemployment rate ticked down to 6.1%, the lowest in almost six years.The strong data sparked speculation that the Federal Reserve could bring forward its timetable for raising interest rates.Industry data earlier showed that Australian job advertisements rose 4.3% in June, after a 5.7% drop in May, whose figure was revised down from a previously estimated 5.6% decline.The Aussie was little changed against the euro, with EUR/AUD dipping 0.01% to 1.4516.             ]]></raw>
