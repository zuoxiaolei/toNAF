<raw><![CDATA[ * All 23 analysts expect Fidesz to win April vote * 16 of 21 analysts see strong Fidesz govt best for economy * Biggest concern: govt may fail to carry out key reforms  By Krisztina Than BUDAPEST, Feb 11 (Reuters) - A strong government formed by main opposition party Fidesz would be best for Hungary's economyafter the April election as it could implement reforms to makethe economy more competitive, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday. The 23 economists polled in the survey, who track Hungary,ranked reforms of local governments, in education and in the taxsystem as the most important ones for the next government tocarry out to strengthen the recession-hit economy. Sixteen of the 21 participants who replied to the questionsaid the best outcome for Hungary's markets and economy would befor centre-right Fidesz to win two-thirds of the seats inparliament, as this would allow Fidesz to overhaul the localgovernment sector, a major drag on the budget. All 23 analysts expect Fidesz to win the vote but 18 of themsaid it would have only a simple majority in parliament. "A 2/3 majority would allow constitutional changes pointingtowards more efficient state ... and municipal reform," saidZoltan Torok, an analyst at Raiffeisen in Budapest. Hungary, which needed a financial rescue package from theInternational Monetary Fund and the EU in 2008 to avoidmeltdown, has stabilised its finances, but its economy plungedinto its deepest downturn in almost two decades. High taxes, a failure to reform a bloated state sectorinherited from its communist past, and a rigid labour markethave eroded the country's competitiveness in recent years. Once a magnet for foreign direct investment, Hungary is nowone of the region's laggards in economic growth. Twenty-one economists in the poll said a key concern aboutthe next government was that it might fail to use its broadpublic support to push through key structural reforms. Attempts by the ruling Socialists to push through reforms inthe past few years were poorly managed and polarized society,and Fidesz opposed most of them."In this respect Fidesz put itself in a straitjacket fromwhich it is going to be difficult to break out," said DanielBebesy at Budapest Fund Management."There is a big risk that the new government will not dare tocarry out any far-reaching structural reform, which would bestrongly needed before joining the euro zone," he added. Hungary has abandoned several target dates for joining theeuro zone and now has no official date for adopting the euro.  FISCAL, CBANK CONCERNS Fourteen analysts listed fiscal loosening and confrontationwith the central bank among the top three post-election worries. Fidesz has criticised the central bank in the past year forfailing to cut rates fast enough and mismanaging the crisis. Fidesz, which last ruled from 1998 to 2002, has also saidthe budget deficit would be around 7.0-7.5 percent of GDP thisyear, far above the government's target of 3.8 percent, mainlybecause of the consolidation of debts of state-owned firms. "We see some relaxation in the budget (to around -4.5 pct)but certainly no blowout beyond this. Fidesz must be very verycareful on this front. Markets will not tolerate any significantdeterioration," said Nomura analyst Peter Attard Montalto. Hungary has a public debt of around 80 percent of GDP andhas to reduce this in a sustainable way to retain the confidenceof foreign investors who finance its debts. "Public debt sustainability will remain a key factor onglobal capital markets, so it's not worth risking confrontingthe IMF," Bebesy said. Seven analysts saw a risk of increased state interventionunder the next government, but only one analyst listedcooperation with the far-right party Jobbik as a key concern. Fidesz had about 35-43 percent support in January opinionpolls with the ruling Socialists polling 12-14 percent andJobbik polling 6-7 percent.
