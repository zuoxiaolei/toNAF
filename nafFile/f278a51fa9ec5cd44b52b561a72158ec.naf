<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen, dollar fall on slower decline in US jobless claims * Oil rises, snaps six-day slide on gasoline buying * Bonds fall, profit-taking sets in after 30-year auction * Wall Street ekes out gain in choppy session (Adds close of U.S. markets) By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, July 9 (Reuters) - A bout of risk aversion thatswept financial markets this week eased on Thursday after U.S.jobless claims declined, lifting global stocks and commodities,including oil, while curbing the appeal of government debt. The U.S. dollar and yen both fell as investors pared backon safety trades after the Labor Department reported the numberof Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell lastweek, easing concern about the U.S. economy. Crude oil prices snapped a six-day losing streak aftertumbling below $60 a barrel, and other commodities rallied asthe weak dollar helped boost the price of raw materials inlocal currencies. Copper prices rallied sharply as investors mulled commentsby the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday that the globaleconomy was slowly starting to emerge from the worst recessionsince World War Two. Also boosting investor sentiment was data showing awidening trade surplus from Germany that capped a week ofpositive developments in Europe's largest economy, and a seniorGerman official told Reuters the country's recession may haveended. The optimism countered recent fears that signs of recoverywould not blossom into growth. The U.S. jobs data was distortedby an unusual pattern of layoffs in the automotive industry,which amplified the drop in claims investors cheered. "People now wonder which trend will be more powerful -- theone seen over the last five days when people sold risky assetsor the one today where they're buying risky assets back," saidDavid Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital marketsin Toronto. "A lot will depend on forthcoming earnings reports and howthe equity markets respond," Watt said. The Dow Jones industrial average  closed up 4.76points, or 0.06 percent, at 8,183.17. The Standard & Poor's 500Index  gained 3.12 points, or 0.35 percent, to 882.68.The Nasdaq Composite Index  advanced 5.38 points, or0.31 percent, to 1,752.55. European shares rebounded after five straight sessions oflosses, with the FTSEurofirst 300  index of topEuropean shares closing up 0.8 percent at 823.32 points. Higher stock prices helped reduce the safe-haven appeal ofgovernment securities, while the Bank of England's decision notto boost its debt purchase program pared expectations theFederal Reserve would enlarge its Treasury buying plan. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell, euro zone government bondfutures eased and British government bonds tumbled on the BoEdecision. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  wasdown 23/32 in price to yield 3.39 percent. The 2-year U.S.Treasury note  was down 1/32 in price to yield 0.93percent. Sterling climbed after the Bank of England kept itsquantitative easing target unchanged, relieving concerns thatthe inflationary policy would be continued. The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies,with the U.S. Dollar Index  down 1.09 percent at 79.883. The euro  was up 1.11 percent at $1.403. Against theyen, the dollar  was down 0.17 percent at 92.97. Talk of refinery shutdowns spurred concerns about U.S.gasoline supply, ending a six-day slide in crude prices. U.S. crude  settled up 27 cents to $60.41 a barrel.Crude had fallen from $71 in the previous six sessions. LondonBrent crude  gained 67 cents to settle at $61.10.
