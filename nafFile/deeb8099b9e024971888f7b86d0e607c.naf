<raw><![CDATA[ * Russian timber duty, rail fees promise prompts EU backing * Russian car industry concessions seen in WTO negotiations * WTO accession could boost Russia GDP by as much as 3.3 pct * WTO represents more than 97 pct of global trade  (Adds background, detail) By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck BRUSSELS, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The European Union formallybacked Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organisation onTuesday, clearing the way for Moscow to join the body in 2011,after 17 years of trying.  EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht and Russian EconomicDevelopment Minister Elvira Nabiullina signed an agreement onthe sidelines of an EU-Russia summit, after the resolution of atariff dispute that had held up EU approval. "Our difficult bilateral issues are resolved. We signed amemorandum of understanding to this end today," EU CommissionPresident Jose Manuel Barroso said. "Russia becoming a WTO member in 2011 is a realisticperspective," he said. The EU, the world's largest trading zone, is Russia'sbiggest trading partner. Its decision to end its WTO veto --largely thanks to Moscow's commitment to phase out exporttariffs on timber and rail freight fees -- removes a majorobstacle to Moscow's accession to top trading nation status. Russia's $1.2 trillion economy makes it the largest outsidethe WTO. The World Bank has estimated that entry could increaseRussian gross domestic product by as much as 3.3 percent in themedium term and 11 percent in the long term. As part of Tuesday's agreement, Russia has promised to lowerexport duties on timber, which are currently set at about 15percent. This will benefit EU paper makers such as UPM, Stora Enso  and M-Real . Russia will also lower fees on Asian freight reaching Europevia Russian railways, EU officials said. Russia's accession still needs approval from the 153-memberWTO. Multilateral negotiations are expected to focus on Russianconcessions that will make it easier for foreign car makers toexport and produce cars in Russia. "Foreign car makers operating in Russia and joint venturesare going to be the big winners. They're the ones that willprogressively take over the market," said Eric Bergelin,Director for Trade and Economics at the European AutomobileManufacturers' Association. Russia hopes WTO entry will increase foreign directinvestment and its exports of steel to the EU market. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has said the countryhopes to join the 153-member WTO in 2011, completing a processthat began in 1993. The WTO represents more than 97 percent ofglobal trade.
