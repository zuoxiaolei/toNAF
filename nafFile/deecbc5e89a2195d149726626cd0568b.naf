<raw><![CDATA[  (Adds quotes, details) ALMATY, March 10 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's central bankbought more than $1.7 billion on the foreign exchange marketlast month to prevent the tenge  from appreciating toofast, it said on Wednesday. The central bank has been buying dollars on the market forthe last several months to stop the tenge from strengtheningtoo sharply as global prices for key Kazakh exports -- oil andmetals -- continued to rise. "We bought quite a lot of currency, more than $1.7 billionin February, to prevent the tenge from strengthening too much,"central bank chairman Grigory Marchenko told reporters. "It's strengthening because oil prices are high, becausecopper prices are high. ... We do not want to impose our ownrate on the market. We always move in line with the market." The central bank has said it could allow the tenge tostrengthen to 127.5 per dollar from the current rate of about147.3 in the medium turn but would prevent any fast exchangerate movements. The tenge, devalued last February by 18 percent, has beenstrengthening since November, gradually catching up with theRussian rouble .
