<raw><![CDATA[ BAGHDAD, Oct 19 (Reuters) - International oil companiessigning deals with the Iraqi government are taking a big risk asthe next government, to be elected in January, may revise orcancel those contracts, a senior lawmaker said on Monday. "Oil companies, which expect to invest billions, should takeinto consideration the big risk behind these contracts. The newgovernment will at a minimum alter the contract terms and thatwill not make the oil firms happy," Ali Hussain Balou, head ofparliament's oil and gas committee, told Reuters. "There are no guarantees for the oil companies that the newgovernment will follow the same path in dealing with them. Thesecontracts might be cancelled or at the very least revised," saidBalou, a Kurdish lawmaker and sharp critic of Iraq's oil policy.
