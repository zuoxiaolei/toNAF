<raw><![CDATA[   * Yen rallies, dollar index edges higher as stocks slide * Dollar rises vs euro for fourth straight session * Aussie down as CPI dents view of bigger rate hike * U.S. new home sales fall, lowers risk appetite (Updates prices; adds quote, details, changes byline) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar and Japaneseyen strengthened on Wednesday as concerns about a globaleconomic recovery and falling stock prices revived safe-havendemand for both currencies. A report showing an unexpected fall in U.S. new home salesfor September offset earlier solid durables goods data andrenewed worries about the health of the housing sector. A deterioration in risk appetite also sent higher-yielding,commodity currencies sharply lower. The Australian dollar fell2 percent, pressured partly by Australian inflation data, whichsuggested the country's central bank was unlikely to tighteninterest rates sharply. "We've had a pretty rough run in the stock market in thelast few days," said Ronald Simpson, director of currencyresearch at Action Economics in Tampa, Florida. "The data recently has been kind of mixed," he added."Overall, I think the short-dollar trade is getting verycrowded and we're going to see some unwinding of it." New single-family home sales fell 3.6 percent to a 402,000until annual pace from a downwardly revised 417,000 units inAugust. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected sales to riseto a 440,000 unit pace. "The (housing) number was surprisingly weak. I think thatis going to add to the trend that we've seen recently whereinvestors are questioning the robust pace of economic recoverygoing forward," said Joe Manimbo, currency trader at TravelexGlobal Business Payments in Washington. "That has benefited the dollar and helped to revive itssafe-haven appeal." In early afternoon trading, the ICE Futures dollar index, ameasure of the greenback against a basket of six othercurrencies, was up 0.3 percent at 76.369. The dollar was down 1.2 percent at 90.65 yen, retreatingfrom a one-month high of 92.33 yen hit on electronic tradingplatform EBS the previous day. The euro fell 1.8 percent to 133.52 yen and was down 0.6percent at $1.4726. It was the fourth straight day the dollargained against the euro. The Australian dollar tumbled 2 percent against thegreenback to US$0.8984. Australian consumer price inflation rose more than expectedlast quarter, yet the increase was not considered alarmingenough to justify a more aggressive tightening in interestrates. Overnight interest rate swaps markets showed investors arenow looking for no more than a 25 basis point rate rise at theReserve Bank of Australia's meeting next week. "For all of its stern rhetoric of late, let's not forgetthat the RBA still needs reason to lift rates in thisdeflationary environment even when growth appears locallyrobust," said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst atInteractive Brokers in Greenwich, Connecticut. The New Zealand dollar fell in sympathy with the Aussiedollar, trading 1.9 percent lower at US$0.7290.             ]]></raw>
