<raw><![CDATA[ WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of StateHillary Clinton on Thursday warned that Internet technologieswere a mixed blessing because they are used by al Qaeda tospread hatred and by authoritarian states to crush dissent. "The same networks that help organize movements for freedomalso enable al Qaeda to spew hatred and incite violence againstthe innocent," she said in a major speech in Washington. "And technologies with the potential to open up access togovernment and promote transparency can also be hijacked bygovernments to crush dissent and deny human rights."
