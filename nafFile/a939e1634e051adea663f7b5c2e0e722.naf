<raw><![CDATA[ * Q4 GDP fell 0.5 pct qq vs earlier estimate of 0.6 pct fall * Weakest quarter for services and households since Q2 2009 * UK goods trade deficit biggest since records began in 1955 * Feb mortgage approvals, consumer credit above expectations  (Wraps in BoE credit data, adds context) By David Milliken and Keith Weir LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Britain's economy suffered itssharpest contraction since mid-2009 late last year, despiteshrinking slightly less than previously estimated, according tofigures that highlight the uncertain nature of its recovery. Economists said Tuesday's final estimate for fourth-quarterGDP data confirmed a weak start point for Britain as thegovernment sets major spending cuts in train and Bank of Englandpolicymakers argue over whether to raise interest rates totackle above-target inflation. However, it is first-quarter economic data next month thatwill be key in clearing up whether the fall in gross domesticproduct was a one-off exacerbated by the coldest December in 100years, or the start of a longer period of sub-par growth. The Office for National Statistics said GDP fell by 0.5percent in the last three months of 2010 -- the same as itsinitial estimate in January but a slightly smaller fall than arevised estimate of 0.6 percent made last month. Heavy snow knocked 0.5 percent off output, the ONS said, andsome economists say the looming public spending cuts are alreadyprompting retrenchment by households and businesses reliant ongovernment jobs and contracts. The fourth-quarter economic contraction makes Britain anoutlier among other major developed economies, including thosesuch as the United States, Germany and France which alsosuffered harsh winter weather but managed to grow. "It's still a pretty lacklustre backdrop and that probablysets the tone for the first half of this year," said RossWalker, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland. Year-on-year, fourth-quarter GDP growth was unrevised at 1.5percent, in line with economists' forecasts. Share prices pared losses after the data, but there waslittle reaction from sterling or the government bond market. "The figures generally have relatively few implications formonetary policy," said Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec.  BOE DILEMMA The weak data has cast doubt on whether Britain's economicrecovery is back on track after the deepest recession since atleast World War Two, as under normal circumstances GDP shouldgrow by just over 0.5 percent a quarter. With inflation more than double its target at 4.4 percent,three BoE policymakers argued last month that rate rises wereoverdue, and that delaying risked creating a wage-price spiral. But the six other members of the BoE's Monetary PolicyCommittee were worried about dismal consumer morale andspending, and that wage growth was likely to remain tepid. Tuesday's GDP data showed that household spending fell by0.3 percent in real terms in the last three months of 2010, itsbiggest drop since the depths of the recession in 2009. For 2010 as a whole, household disposable income sufferedits biggest real-terms fall since 1977. Separate Bank of England data also released on Tuesdayshowed a bigger-than-expected rise in mortgage approvals and theamount of consumer lending, though both remained well belowpre-recession averages. The ONS data showed that both the services sector and theconstruction sector suffered their biggest contractions sincethe second quarter of 2009, though the declines were less steepthan the ONS had earlier estimated.  Industrial output grew at its fastest pace since the secondquarter of 2010, but this did not stop Britain recording itsbiggest goods trade deficit since records began in 1955. Economists at Citi said that some of the sharp rise inimports could have been due to businesses increasing inventoriesbefore a rise in sales tax took effect at the start of 2011. Both the BoE and the government have forecast that Britishexports should recover strongly in time, given that sterlingsuffered its steepest fall in trade-weighted terms since the1930s during 2007 and 2008. However, the opposition Labour Party said Tuesday's datareinforced its view that the government should scale back plansto cut spending -- which currently aim to largely eliminate abudget deficit of over 10 percent of GDP over the next 4 years.
