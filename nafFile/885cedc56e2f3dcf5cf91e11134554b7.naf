<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com – Only 400 new jobs were created in Australia in February, official data showed on Thursday, defying far rosier expectations.  The Australian Bureau of Statistics said the figure, which came after a revised 56,500 new jobs were created in January, followed the loss of 11,000 part-time positions offset the 11,400 full-time jobs that were created.  Economists had expected 15,000 new jobs to be added to the labor market.  The bureau also said Australia's unemployment rate rose to 5.3% in February from January's revised 5.2 percent, as expected.  Following the release of the data, the Australian dollar was slightly up against its U.S. counterpart, with AUD/USD gaining 0.07% to hit 0.9161.             ]]></raw>
