<raw><![CDATA[ * Markets irrational, no immediate action needed - Juncker * Euro clings to gains after rebound from 4-yr low * Greece braces for anti-austerity strike * China says stability of reserve currencies very important * France says does not share Merkel's concerns over euro  (Adds French economy minister) By Stanley White and Holger Hansen TOKYO/BERLIN, May 20 (Reuters) - A senior euro zone officialsaid on Thursday financial markets were acting irrationally overthe euro area's debt problems and while he was concerned aboutthe fall in the euro, immediate action was not needed. The euro slumped to a four-year low on Wednesday after aunilateral German move to ban naked short selling on someinstruments exposed political divisions in Europe and stokedfears of tighter financial regulation. Underscoring those splits France, still smarting from theGerman ban on which it was not consulted, said it did not sharethe view of German Chancellor Angela Merkel who on Wednesdaysaid the euro was in danger. "I absolutely do not think that the euro is in danger,"French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde told RTL radio onThursday. "The euro is a solid and credible currency." China said the euro crisis -- fuelled by Germany's move tostamp on speculators -- was adding to global uncertainties, afactor underlined by fresh weakness in stock markets. Naked short selling involves selling a financial instrumentwithout first borrowing the instrument or ensuring that it canbe borrowed, as would be done in a conventional short sale. The common currency has been under intense pressure formonths as concerns over Greece's heavy debts have cast doubt onthe euro zone's ability to pull fiscally weak EU countries outof the mire. Greece braced for a 24 hour general strike on Thursday inprotest against the tough austerity measures demanded by theEuropean Union and the International Monetary fund in exchangefor a 110 billion euro bailout. Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the Eurogroup forum of eurozone finance ministers, said the weakness in the euro, down morethan 7 percent against the dollar in the past month alone, waslikely due to fears that economic growth in the 16 countriesthat share the currency will slow. But markets were acting irrationally, he said. "There are expectations that growth is slowing down becauseof the deficit cuts we have to take," Juncker told Reuters inTokyo. "There is a certain reluctance to believe the Greeks canovercome the current crisis. I don't think the markets arebehaving in a rational way."  NO EURO ACTION YET The euro rebounded late on Wednesday as traders coveredshort positions on speculation European monetary officials mightmove to check its rapid fall. Juncker, speaking to reporters after meeting JapaneseFinance Minister Naoto Kan in Tokyo, said he did not see theneed to take immediate action on the euro's rapid plunge butsaid central banks were in close contact. "Monetary authorities are monitoring closely exchange ratedevelopments and they best know what to do. I'm concernedbecause the rapidness of the fall in the euro is impressive. I'mnot concerned as far as the current exchange rate is concerned." The instability is worrying China though, which called foran international response. "The European sovereign debt crisis is a challenge not justfor the countries that are party to it, such as Greece. In fact,it is a challenge to the stability of the entire internationalfinancial market," said assistant finance minister Zhu Guangyao. "It concerns the recovery of the entire internationaleconomy, and so it demands a common response from theinternational community," he said. Zhu told a news conference the euro zone sovereign debtcrisis showed the need for countries to control their debtlevels and maintaining the stability of major reserve currencieswas "very important".  IRRATIONAL OR UNCERTAIN? Greece and Spain have promised tough austerity measures toreduce their fiscal deficits, and the European Commission hasproposed that European Union countries submit their initialbudget proposals so the EU executive can make sure countries aredoing enough to rebuild their finances. The European Central Bank has also taken the unprecedentedstep of buying euro-denominated government debt as part of a 750billion euro plan to help stabilise markets. In an effort to counter massive volatility in markets,Germany stepped up its fight against speculators with a ban onsome financial trades on Wednesday. But the move triggered big market falls and wrong footedEuropean governments that said they were not consulted. Analysts saw the move as a political gesture to placateGerman public opinion after her party lost a regional electionthis month. "It again suggests that the Germans are no closer tounderstanding that the markets are not the problem here. Themarkets are right to be uncertain about the sustainability ofthe euro zone in its current form," said Simon Tilford, chiefeconomist at the Centre for European Reform. "What is specific to Germany is a readiness to makeunilateral announcements on things that would only be doable ifthey were done collectively...It's pretty populist stuff."
