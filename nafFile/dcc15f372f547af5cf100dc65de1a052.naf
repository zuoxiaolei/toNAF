<raw><![CDATA[ * March 31 donors conference to fund Haiti reconstruction * Aim is not only to repair, but relaunch development * Ordinary Haitians skeptical, worries over corruption By Pascal Fletcher and Joseph Guyler Delva PORT-AU-PRINCE, March 28 (Reuters) - "Retou ala Vi. AyitiPap Peri" (Back to life, Haiti will not die) reads the bannerin Creole stretched up beside a crowded camp of earthquakesurvivors in the heart of the wrecked capital Port-au-Prince. Life, in the form of bustling pedestrians, chaotic trafficand teeming street markets, has indeed bounced back in the cityafter the devastating Jan. 12 quake that killed maybe more than300,000 and turned streets into jumbles of rubble. But a massive task of reconstructing the quake-shatteredcapital and its dependent nation -- a small Caribbean statethat was already a byword for poverty in the Western Hemisphere-- now faces Haiti's government and donors when they meet inNew York on Wednesday to pledge funds and agree to strategies. President Rene Preval and the country's foreign partnershave stressed that the rebuilding should seek not just to putback what was lost -- the destroyed buildings, schools andhospitals -- but lift Haiti out of the cycle of instability andunderdevelopment that has kept it mired in misery for decades. "Haiti is on its knees, we must get it to stand back up,"Preval said in a recent speech to private entrepreneurs. Estimates of damage inflicted by the magnitude 7.0 quake,viewed by some as the most deadly natural disaster in recenthistory, range between $8 billion and $14 billion. Participants in Wednesday's conference will look to securenot only a major envelope of funds -- an initial figurecontemplates $3.8 billion over 18 months, much more for thelonger term -- but also a viable blueprint for Haiti'ssuccessful future development. This will try to tackle some of the restraints that havelocked Haiti in a poverty trap for years. Proposals include an urgent decentralization strategy tocreate jobs and wealth outside the capital of some 4 millionpeople -- more than a third of the country's population --which has so monopolized national economic life that Haitiansjokingly refer to it as the "Republic of Port-au-Prince." There are also calls to rally private investment to thereconstruction effort, for example in textile manufacturing,tourism, and agriculture, where cheap subsidized imports ofrice and sugar have kept Haitian peasant farmers relegated todirt-poor subsistence farming. Supporters of Haiti, who include former U.S. President BillClinton, who spent his honeymoon there and is now the specialUnited Nations coordinator for the relief effort, say thedisaster provides an opportunity to "build back better." "This country has the best chance to escape its past thatit's ever had," Clinton said last week in a visit to Haiti. "Ashorrible as this is, it gives them a chance to start again." STILL AN EMERGENCY OPERATION But this hopeful vision must be set against the deeppessimism that seems to affect many ordinary Haitians,accustomed as they are to seeing the country's resources, andforeign largesse, being monopolized by a small elite. Thespecter of corruption looms large in the national conscience. "There might be some more money (from the donors), butthose who need it won't receive it," said mother of threeGilene Morquette, as she jostled in a crush of women waiting toreceive a Save the Children aid handout at a sprawling quakesurvivors' camp in the city's Petionville golf club. Skepticism also gripped 47-year-old barber Raymond Martinas he showed reporters his destroyed barber shop in the ruineddowntown city center. He lost a child in the quake. "For Haiti to have a chance, the foreigners must be theones who reconstruct," he said. "I don't want Haitians togovern, we should have a foreign protectorate here," he said,touching off a debate on the still rubble-strewn street side. There will be no foreign protectorate -- donors and aidpartners are careful to insist that Haiti's government directsthe reconstruction -- but monitoring mechanisms are beingincluded in plans to finance the rebuilding effort. The World Bank is due to act as "fiscal agent" of aMulti-Donors Trust Fund to be created for Haiti. But while the government and donors plan reconstruction,aid workers are urging them not to ignore the immediate needsof the more than 1 million homeless quake survivors who arestill camped out precariously in streets and open spaces,vulnerable to the approaching rains and hurricane season. "For us, this remains an emergency operation," said IainLogan, head of Haiti operations of the International Federationof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. He saw Haiti's rebuilding as a bigger challenge even thanthe reconstruction after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. "In myprofessional lifetime, we've never had to rebuild a capitalcity, on which the whole country was fundamentally based." The European Union and a coalition of U.S.-basedhumanitarian groups have indicated they are likely to pledgemore than $2.7 billion for Haiti at the New York conference. U.S. President Barack Obama has asked Congress for $2.8billion in funds for Haiti relief and reconstruction costs. But there is recognition this will be a long job. "No onewalks away from the scenes of devastation I've seen ... within18 months. This is for the long haul," said BritishInternational Development Minister Mike Foster, after a visitlast week.
