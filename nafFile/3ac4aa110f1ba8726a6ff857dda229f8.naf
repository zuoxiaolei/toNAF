<raw><![CDATA[ * MSCI Asia ex-Japan near 3-month high, up 0.3 pct for 2010 * European bank results, U.S. manufacturing data boostshares * Nikkei up 1.3 pct, upside potential seen limited * Dollar hovers near 3-month low By Vikram S.Subhedar HONG KONG, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose to theirhighest levels in nearly three months on Tuesday, boosted bystrong European bank results and a sign the U.S. economy wasstronger than expected. European shares edged lower as investors took a breatherafter Monday's strong rally sparked by robust results fromfinancial heavyweights HSBC and BNP Paribas. The bank results and stronger-than-expected manufacturingdata from the United States boosted Wall Street on Monday andin turn fired up Asia on Tuesday. "A combination of solid earnings from HSBC and BNP Paribasand strong U.S. manufacturing data has significantly easedeconomic worries and boosted appetite for stocks," said LeeSun-yeb, a market analyst at Shinhan Investment Corporation. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index rose 0.2 percent to itshighest level since early May. It has rallied strongly fromearly July on optimism the world would avoid a 'double-dip'recession and is just in positive territory for the year. However, after rallying nearly 18 percent from 2010 lowshit in May, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index could face some upsideresistance with the relative strength index (RSI) nudging 70,suggesting the market is close to being overbought. U.S. stocks closed at their highest level in 10 weeks onMonday as the S&P 500 pierced key technical levels. Energystocks jumped as a weak the dollar drew investors into crudefutures, which rose 3 percent. Reflecting the greater risk appetite seen in stocks, Asiandebt spreads tightened to their narrowest spreads in nearlythree months. "There is money to be put to work. Funds kept ahigher-than-normal cash balance over the past few monthsbecause they were worried about redemptions, but theredemptions did not happen," said a bond trader from Singapore. "Now, it is a question of do you hold cash and miss therally or put the money to work before the rally ends." YEN LIMITS NIKKEI GAINS Japan's Nikkei, which has lagged regional markets in recentweeks, climbed 1.3 percent. Mmarket players said though thatthe strength of the yen, which at 86.46 per dollar is close toan eight-month low of 85.95 hit last week, may limit furtherstock gains. The Nikkei is down over 8 percent in 2010 and has risen 5.6percent in the past two weeks on strong corporate results fromheavyweights such as Sony and Honda Motor. However, analysts are cautious. "This rise is difficult to trust, since it was based mainlyon short-covering in thin volume. If something bad happens, themarkets are likely to fall just as fast," said Yutaka Miura, asenior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities. "Because the yen remains strong, gains in Tokyo -- likelyto be mostly short-covering anyway -- will be limited." Shares of trading houses gained after copper and oil priceshit three-month highs on Monday as data eased fears of adouble-dip recession by showing that global manufacturing wasstill expanding. Mitsubishi Corp jumped 4.7 percent and Itochu Corp closed5.6 percent higher, its best single-day rise in over a year. The dollar was hovering near a three-month low against abasket of currencies, hobbled by worries over the strength ofthe U.S. recovery after a series of economic data in the pastmonth undershot market expectations and suggested that theFederal Reserve would keep rates low for some time to come. "The low-for-long Fed, coupled with talk of morequantitative easing, yields itself to a dollar-funded carrytrade," Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior strategist at CreditAgricole, said in a note. He added that the dollar is likely tostay under pressure in the short term. U.S. data, such as June personal income, June factoryorders and July auto sales, expected later on Tuesday, willoffer further clues about the health of the U.S. economy.
