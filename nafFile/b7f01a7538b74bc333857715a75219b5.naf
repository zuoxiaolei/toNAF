And the dollar climbed against the yen on thestronger-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data. "This is a dollar-positive report, especially looking atdollar/yen, which has been more sensitive to U.S. economic datain the sense that better U.S. numbers are good for the dollaragainst the yen," said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategistat Wells Fargo in New York, of the ISM data.  U.S. President Barack Obama's budget projected a recorddeficit in 2010, but traders said it had little currencyimpact.

The euro traded up 0.4 percent at $1.3911, not far from anearlier low of $1.3854, according to Reuters data, its weakestsince early July. Traders said the next downside level to watch was $1.3850,where a large option barrier was said to reside. The single currency, however, remained near seven-monthlows on concerns over the debt of some euro zone countries.Analysts said the euro remained vulnerable as concern persistedabout the debt levels of Greece and Portugal. The European Union's Economic and Monetary Affairscommissioner, Joaquin Almunia, said in a Reuters interview thatGreece's fiscal cutback plans were "ambitious but achievable." The dollar index, a calculated measure of the greenback'sperformance against six other major currencies, was down 0.2percent at 79.341, off an earlier high of 79.534, its strongestsince late July.

The Australian dollar later recovered and was last atUS$0.8879, up 0.4 percent, and at 80.62 yen, up 1 percent.
