<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar hits 10-month low vs index, world stocks 2-yr high * Emerging market stocks rise 1 percent to June 2008 highs * U.S. stock futures indicate firmer open, gold record peak  By Carolyn Cohn LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit a 10-monthlow and world stocks hit 2-year highs on Thursday afterSingapore let its currency strengthen with investors seeingeasier U.S. monetary policy driving a flight to high-yieldingassets. Emerging market and other riskier assets are receiving awave of investment ahead of an expected second round ofquantitative easing -- money-printing -- by the U.S. FederalReserve. China has largely resisted pressure from developed powersfor a gradual appreciation of the yuan, and the U.S. attempt tokickstart its economy is driving money elsewhere in search ofhigher yields. The Singapore dollar hit multi-year highs after Singapore,which is suffering from rising inflation, allowed its tradingband to widen, following a similar move this week by the Russiancentral bank. "Effectively the Singapore move is a tightening of policyand it clearly shows Asian economies are at the opposite end ofthe spectrum compared to the spare capacity in the U.S.economy," said Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING. Recent moves by emerging market powers such as Brazil andThailand to curb currency appreciation and a war of words amongglobal policymakers about FX imbalances reflect a lack ofconsensus ahead of a meeting of G20 financial leaders next week. The dollar hit a 10-month low against an index of currenciesand also struck an eight-month low against the euro, a 15-yearlow against the yen and a 28-year low close to parity with theAustralian dollar. The MSCI world equity index rose over 0.7 percent to 319.45,its best showing since shortly after the collapse of Lehman inSept 2008. The Thomson Reuters global stock index also hittwo-year highs before trimming gains. U.S. stock futures rose 0.22 percent, pointing to a firmeropen on Wall Street and the FTSEurofirst 300 index rose to5-month highs before trimming gains. The MSCI global emerging equities index rose 1 percent toits highest since June 2008. "Stronger emerging market Asian economic growth, despite aweak U.S. economy, continues to feed the flow of investmentfunds into emerging Asia and countries with strong links...suchas Australia, and away from the U.S.," said analysts at Barclaysin a client note. "Investors may read (Singapore's) move as a sign of greaterwillingness on the part of other emerging Asian central banks toallow further dollar depreciation." Oil also rose towards five-month highs above $84 per barrelin a broad-based rally of commodities fuelled by a slump in thedollar and news of a surprise drop in U.S. stockpiles.  The falling U.S. dollar lifted gold prices to a record high$1,387.10 an ounce. Bund futures fell 13 ticks as investors favoured riskierassets.
