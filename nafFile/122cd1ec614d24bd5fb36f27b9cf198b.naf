<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen drops, correcting sharp gains from Wednesday * U.S. initial jobless claims fall steeply * Higher-risk currencies recover * Sterling shines as BoE keeps QE target unchanged * Aussie gains but Australia-China rift casts a shadow (Recasts, adds comment, updates prices, adds details,changes byline) By Nick Olivari NEW YORK, July 9 (Reuters) -  The yen and the U.S. dollarfell on Thursday, giving back some gains from the previoussession as U.S. stocks rose, while sterling moved higher afterthe Bank of England kept its quantitative easing targetunchanged. But against the yen, the dollar extended its rise after agovernment report showed the number of U.S. workers filing newclaims for jobless benefits fell sharply last week, thoughcontinued claims rose to a record. European stocks snapped a five-session losing streak,helping to buoy the euro and perceived higher risk currencies,which tumbled on Wednesday as optimism about the globaleconomy's recovery prospects waned and investors trimmed riskexposure. U.S. stocks rose after the U.S. weekly joblessreport. The U.S. jobless claims report should "end up being a netpositive because companies have stopped firing people, andthat's the first step towards stabilizing the labor sector,"said Boris Schlossberg, director of FX research at GFT in NewYork. "The report should prove relatively positive for riskappetite and support the euro and sterling against thedollar." In early trading in New York the dollar rose 0.2 percentfrom late U.S. trade to 93 yen, having hit a five-month troughof 91.80 on EBS trading systems the previous day. The euro climbed 0.9 percent to 130.03 yen after falling toaround 127.00 yen on Wednesday, its lowest since mid-May. Analysts said however, that the current moves arecorrective and do not represent any fundamental shift in marketsentiment. "We had a massive move yesterday, and the market reallyneeded to correct," said Brown Brothers Harriman currencystrategist Audrey Childe-Freeman in London. "The scale of the rally (in the yen) was overdone, and wehave seen some position adjustments, but the market is stilllooking quite nervous," she said. Wednesday's sharp rise in the yen prompted Japan's topgovernment spokesman to say excessive foreign exchange moveswere undesirable, while Japanese officials said they werekeeping a close watch on currencies. The dollar index was little changed at 80.092, while theeuro was up 0.8 percent at $1.3984 after falling as low as$1.3830 on Wednesday. STERLING SHINES Sterling outperformed after the BoE left its asset buyingprogram at 125 billion pounds, just as most in the market hadexpected the central bank to expand the total by 25 billionpounds. Sterling jumped by 1.1 percent against the U.S. dollar to$1.6247, while the euro lost 0.4 percent against the UKcurrency to 86.05 pence. The news that the BoE was not expanding quantitative easingcame as the central bank left key interest rates unchanged at0.5 percent, as widely expected. "The Monetary Policy Committee has sent a clear signal thatthe endgame for QE has arrived," RBS economist Ross Walkersaid, who described the decision to leave the QE targetunchanged as "a significant surprise." Among other currencies seen as higher risk, the Australiandollar recovered 0.7 percent to $0.7839, though analysts saidthe currency is highly sensitive to concerns about Australia'sties with its top trading partner China. China confirmed on Thursday the arrest of an Australianmining executive and three others on spying allegations in acase that has raised questions about China-Australiarelations. Those concerns cast a further shadow against the Australiandollar on Wednesday, when it fell more than 1 percent againstthe dollar and 3.5 percent against the yen.             ]]></raw>
