<raw><![CDATA[ * "Real, demonstrative commitment" sought from China * U.S.: Pace, conviction key to showing Beijing's resolve * Geithner to lay out vision for economic goals of summit  (Repeats with no change in content) By Emily Kaiser and Caren Bohan WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The United States wants a"real, demonstrative commitment" from China that it is seriousabout shifting away from export-led economic growth, a U.S.official told Reuters on Tuesday ahead of next week's statevisit by China's Hu Jintao. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will on Wednesday layout his vision for how the world's two biggest economic powersshould interact. But the official's comments indicate someimpatience with China's gradual approach to allowing itscurrency to rise and building up domestic demand. "It's both the pace in which they do it and the convictionwith which they demonstrate they're going to do it," said thesenior Obama administration official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.

Not only did Obama get scant international support at theG20 meeting for pressuring China to speed up the yuan's rise,but he also got an earful from allies about his own country'seconomic policy. Topping the list of complaints was the U.S.Federal Reserve's decision to buy $600 billion in governmentdebt to try to spur a stronger economic recovery. Eswar Prasad, a Brookings Institution economist and formerInternational Monetary Fund official with responsibility forChina, said Geithner's speech would seek to wrest back controlof the economic message. "There is a sense that at the Seoul G20 summit, Chinamanaged to take charge of the narrative, especially about theeffects of (the Fed's bond-buying program) on the rest of theworld, thereby deflecting attention from yuan and tradepolicy," Prasad said. PRESSURE EASES Geithner is the first of several top U.S. officials fanningout to preview Hu's visit and detail the White House'q aims.Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will give what an aidecalled a "major" address on U.S.-China relatimns on Friday.
