<raw><![CDATA[ * China inflation fastest in 2 yrs, supporting rate hikeview * LME copper hits record high, oil at 2-year high * Japan's Nikkei at highest since June on technicals, yen * China policy, G20 outcome make outlook for risk unclear  (Repeats to more subscribers) By Kevin Plumberg HONG KONG, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei stock indexrose to its highest since June on Thursday, adding to returnsthat have outstripped U.S. and European markets in November,while a blast of Chinese economic data sent copper prices to arecord high. European shares opened modestly higher with theFTSEurofirst 300 up 0.2 percent, London's FTSE 100 up 0.5percent and German's DAX up 0.4 percent. But U.S. stock indexfutures were slightly weaker. Chinese consumer price inflation in October quicked to itsfastest pace in two years, which is likely to sharpencomplaints from Beijing and others that the Federal Reserve's$600 billion money printing scheme will hasten capital flows totheir economies, complicating efforts to keep price pressuresat bay. Shares of large Chinese banks listed in Hong Kong rose onthe views that banks can take advantage of higher lending rateswhile not necessarily paying more on deposits since in the nearterm China has few choices but to keep raising interest rates. "China's process of normalising monetary conditions isgoing to accelerate," said Dong Tao, chief economist fornon-Japan Asia at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. "Inflation is higher than expected and, more importantly,the authorities are giving up the thought that inflation isgoing to peak soon, which means that they have to take a newlook at the inflation outlook and also take the so-calledquantitative easing into consideration." China's complaints are being aired at a contentious Groupof 20 leaders meeting in Seoul that kicked off on Thursday. Abreakthrough on alleviating economic imbalances could heraldknee-jerk buying of risky assets and halt a U.S. dollar rallythat has lifted it to a 1-month high. The Nikkei rose 0.3 percent after closing on Wednesdayabove the 38.2 percent retracement of the move down since Aprilto 2010 lows in September. That level is important for traderswho use historical chart patterns to make decisions. Shares of big exporters such as Toyota Motor Co and CanonInc were among the biggest lifts to the index, with the dollarup nearly 2 yen in November. This month, the 7.4 percent gain in the Nikkei, Asia'ssecond-worst performing equity index year to date, is higherthan the 3 percent rise in the U.S. S&P 500 index and theroughly 2 percent increase in the FTSEurofirst 300 index The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japansurrendered early gains to stand little changed by lateafternoon, threatening to extend a string of three down daysafter South Korea recorded its biggest single day of netforeign selling of shares. BUST, CAUTION Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 1.5 percent, withmainland Chinese stocks listed in the territory up 2 percent Bank stocks were leading the charge, with some investorshopeful for improving net interest margins, or the differencebetween lending and deposit rates. Chinese banks were some ofthe biggest decliners in the prior session, suggesting somevalue-driven investing as well. Credit Suisse analysts said Chinese banks and insurers willprobably benefit the most from higher interest rates and stablegrowth, but runaway inflation poses explosive risks, namelybursting bubbles in Hong Kong. "With its economy closely linked with the overheatingChinese economy but its monetary policy linked to the U.S.under the dollar peg, HK is now a hotbed for asset bubbles,"the analysts said in a note. The Australian dollar was trading nearly unchanged on theday at US$1.0038, fighting back after the country'sunemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 5.4 percent, reducingthe chances of a rate increase in February, and China'shigher-than-expected CPI. With the fundamental outlook for Australia stillconvincingly positive, the Reserve Bank of Australia may haveto raise rates again in coming months and therefore thecurrency would unlikely stay down for long. "Strong levels of participation are consistent with astrong and healthy labour market. Unemployment remains in the5.1-5.4 percent that has been in all year. It remainsconsistent with the RBA's tightening bias," said Su-Lin Ong,senior economist with RBC Capital Markets in Sydney. The U.S. dollar index a measure of the currency'sperformance against a basket of six other major currencies, wasdown 0.1 percent though up 2.3 percent since the Fed announcedits new bond buying programme. Bets against the dollar had grown significant in the run-upto the Fed's highly anticipated quantitative easing last week,causing dealers to trim positions with an eye on the year end. Commodity traders took advantage of the pause on thedollar's rally and focused on the solid retail sales andinvestment numbers out of China. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose to arecord high of $8,966 a tonne. When the China's data firststarted to emerge copper was flat at $8,760. Crude for December delivery was up 0.7 percent to $88.39 abarrel the highest since October 2008. (Editing by Robert Birsel)             ]]></raw>
