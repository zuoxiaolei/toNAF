<raw><![CDATA[ * Interest rate swaps paid in Asia as equities rally * Singapore GDP, Australian confidence index raise optimism * New Zealand shrugs off Bollard, China swaps higher By Vidya Ranganathan SINGAPORE, July 14 (Reuters) - Asian interest rate swapsrose on Tuesday in step with a rally in equity markets drivenby an upbeat outlook for U.S. financial sector earnings thisweek as well as some pointers to economic recovery in Asia. One-year swaps in Singapore and Hong Kong rose by 4 basispoints each, with the former hitting 1.2 percent. Mimicking Wall Street where analyst reports for betterfinancial sector earnings pushed up stocks overnight, Asianstock markets rose, with indices in Hong Kong and Japan up morethan 2 percent. Singapore's better-than-expected second-quarter economicoutput data and an uptick in Australia's NAB confidence indexfurthered that optimism that caused rate markets to sell off. "The Singapore GDP numbers confirmed the relative optimismabout growth in the region," said UBS strategist Ju Wang. "More importantly, rates had come down quite a lot in theregion so it wouldn't be surprising to see that when stocks goup relatively on a day like this, you should see rates goinghigher." Indeed, the one-year Singapore interest rate swap had hitits lowest since November on Monday after having fallen sincelate June as equity markets fell, doubts arose about how fastthe global economy would recover from the crisis and monetarytightening seemed a distant prospect. China's onshore swaps were more volatile, with 10-yearswaps showing a rise of between 5 and 20 bps. There, traderssaid, the paying interest had more to do with tighteningmonetary conditions owing to the central bank's attempts torein in bank lending. Interbank repo rates in China have been rising in line withthe steady uptrend in rates at central bank auctions, with7-day repo hitting 1.5 percent on Tuesday. The People's Bank of China let the rates on its short-termbond repo operations rise for a third straight week, suggestingit is guiding the upward move in short-term money market rates. The bank drained 80 billion yuan ($11.71 billion) via28-day repos at a rate of 1.05 percent on Tuesday, up from 1.00percent on the same operations conducted last week. NEW ZEALAND RATES In Australia, NAB's business conditions index jumped to itsbest level in 9 months. The bearishness in the rates market following that datapushed one-year yields up 10 bps to 3.255 percent and appearedto have affected the New Zealand market more so than commentsfrom Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Alan Bollard on theeconomy. Bollard said he expected the New Zealand economy to emergefrom recession earlier than other countries, that monetaryeasing had been sufficient and that the economy needed a weakercurrency. Three-month bill yields in New Zealand moved up by 1 bps to2.84 percent. But yields at an auction of 3-month bills were2.71 percent, 6 bps higher than at a similar auction a weekago. Khoon Goh, a senior markets strategist at ANZ-NationalBank, said Bollard's remarks were not new. "We saw a big sell-off in the Australian rates market, andthat subsequently had an impact on the New Zealand market aswell," said Goh. "We've seen the curve steepen" "Bollard's comments were a reiteration of earlier commentsand obviously they want to see the economy rebalance. "But the markets are largely expecting no further moves tointerest rates and hikes to start next year." Goh expects RBNZ to raise its 2.5 percent policy rate onlyin late 2010, but he said the market had priced in the firstrate rise in March 2010. (Editing by Kazunori Takada)             ]]></raw>
