<raw><![CDATA[ * Obama seeks to resolve remaining FTA issues before Nov. * Autos have been main issue blocking the Korea trade pact * Administration says U.S. risks losing market share (Updates with new Obama comment, reaction) By Alister Bull and Patricia Zengerle TORONTO, June 26 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obamavowed on Saturday to make a new push to complete a long-stalledfree trade agreement with South Korea, one of the thorniestissues on his trade agenda. Obama, speaking after a meeting with South Korean PresidentLee Myung-Bak at the G20 summit in Toronto, said he wanted tomove forward methodically in ironing out remaining issues withthe deal, with everything ready in time for his visit to Seoulin November for the next Group of 20 leaders meeting. The deal has met stern resistance in the U.S. Congress,where Obama's fellow Democrats control a majority of votes. "I want to make sure that everything is lined up properlyby the time I get to Korea in November, and in a few monthsfollowing that, I intend to present it to Congress," Obamasaid. "It is the right thing to do for our country. It is theright thing to do for the Koreans. It will strengthen ourcommercial ties," he said. The announcement marked the first time Obama set a deadlinefor resolving problems with the agreement the United States andSouth Korea signed almost exactly three years ago, on June 30,2007, when Obama's Republican predecessor, George W. Bush, waspresident. Lee said he welcomed Obama setting a date for theagreement. Many U.S. lawmakers have complained about the pact's autoprovisions, which they said did too little to tear down SouthKorea's "non-tariff barriers" to U.S. auto imports. Thereaction to Obama's announcement was guarded. 'ONE-WAY TRADE' "Congress expects to be consulted actively in thesenegotiations, and the date targeted by the President can be metonly if the outstanding issues are fully addressed withenforceable commitments," said House of Representatives Waysand Means Committee Chairman Sander Levin. Levin, a Democrat from the auto manufacturing state ofMichigan, said Korean regulatory and tax barriers had led to"one way trade" that hurt U.S. manufacturers and kept Americanbeef sales out of South Korea. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said Obama'sannouncement was "great news for America's economy," but addedSouth Korean barriers to U.S. beef "must be removed." The White House acknowledged there remained issues to beironed out and specifically cited cars and U.S. beef. Obama opposed the agreement during his 2008 presidentialcampaign, but has said in previous meetings with Lee, a closeU.S. ally, that he wanted to work to win approval of the pact. "South Korea has the 14th largest economy in the world, andour ability to compete in that market is critical to preservingand supporting new jobs for Americans," a senior U.S. officialsaid. "This initiative aims to reverse the declining U.S.market share of Korean imports." The prospect of South Korean agreements with the EuropeanUnion, Canada and other countries also means the United Statesneeds to act to improve its competitive position in the Asiancountry, the official said, citing a study showing the UnitedStates stood to lose about $30 billion in exports without adeal.
