<raw><![CDATA[ * Trade finance scarce for developing countries * Expensive where available * Risk factors outweigh supply of funds  By Jonathan Lynn GENEVA, May 16 (Reuters) - Trade finance, vital to keep thewheels of international trade turning, remains a concern forpoor countries in Africa and other regions, even as globalcommerce rebounds in the recovery, trade finance sources said. Practitioners in the $10 trillion market are now talking toregulators to ensure that efforts to stop banks hiding toxicassets do not make it harder and costlier to extend tradefinance, traditionally one of the safest forms of credit. The World Trade Organization will host a meeting of tradefinance bankers, international financial institutions andregulators on May 18 to monitor the state of the market ahead ofthe G20 summit in Toronto next month. That follows a progress report on the $250 billion tradefinance package agreed at the G20 summit in London in April lastyear that was submitted to G20 finance ministers at last month'sInternational Monetary Fund/World Bank meetings in Washington. "There is continuous concern about this issue," said onetrade finance expert. The Toronto summit will be asked to target remainingresources in the package at African and other borrowers stillcut off from trade finance, he said. Some 90 percent of the $12 trillion in trade in merchandisegoods is underpinned by trade finance -- typically short-termself-liquidating credits in use for centuries that have muchlower default rates than other types of loan. The credit crunch in 2008 caused trade finance to dry uptoo, spurring a slump in trade, although the 12.2 percentcontraction in trade in 2009 reflected lower demand rather thana shortage of funding over the year as a whole. The WTO now forecasts trade will rebound by 9.5 percent thisyear. Surveys show finance is available for trade between richnations and countries around the Pacific, including China. The concern is that this recovery has not yet reachedsmaller banks in Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia and LatinAmerica, with 30-40 countries still having difficulties.  CREDIT RISK One problem is that many countries have suffered creditrating downgrades, forcing banks to set aside more capital underprudential regulations to cover loans to borrowers in thosecountries. The rules state that an individual borrower'screditworthiness can never be better than the country's rating. Trade finance deals for oil-rich Angola are paying 40-50percent interest at an annual rate, and Mexico is paying 20percent after a downgrade, the trade finance expert said. Looked at another way, one major trade finance bank is nowcharging for a three-month trade finance deal in Kenya --Africa's best credit risk -- a spread of 320 basis points, or3.2 percentage points, over banks' costs of borrowing, plusrequiring export credit insurance adding another 300 basispoints, and requiring cash collateral of 50 percent, he said. Before the crisis a Kenyan borrower would have paid a spreadof less than 100 basis points over interbank rates. Studies by the WTO and African Development Bank suggest thatexport financing is available for African countries frominstitutions such as pan-African lender Ecobank Transnational or South Africa's Standard Bank , although athigher costs and for smaller volumes than before the crisis. But trade financing -- often the only form of internationalcredit available to African countries -- to cover imports fromfuel to machinery has dried up for smaller banks. The risk is that firms in these countries that entered theformal economy with access to bank credit will be forced backinto the informal sector, hitting the state's tax base. The G20 report found that halfway through the two-year lifeof the $250 billion package, $188 billion has been mobilised and$110 billion disbursed, with banks unable to find enoughcreditworthy borrowers to use all the money available. "They're telling you the problem is less one of liquiditythan of risk," the trade finance expert said. Besides counterparty risk, one question that bankers willwant to discuss at the May 18 meeting with regulators from theBasel Committee on Banking Supervision is the treatment of tradefinance instruments, such as letters of credit. These are traditionally held off banks' balance sheets whilethe details of importer, exporter and shipper are being checkedbecause they are not a firm commitment until the last minute --and some 75 percent are rejected during verification. But proposed new banking regulations to prevent banks hidingtoxic assets off their balance sheets would cover unconfirmedtrade finance instruments too, driving up their cost. "Clearly trade finance is not at the root of the financialcrisis -- you are not leveraging by using standby letters ofcredit," the trade finance expert said. Together with the International Chamber of Commerce, the 10biggest banks in the sector with portfolios of up to $300-400billion are preparing a database of trade finance default ratesto demonstrate to regulators the relative safety of the credits. Banks invited to the May 18 meeting include HSBC ,Citibank , BNP Paribas , Standard Chartered and Brazilian development bank BNDES. (Editing by Ralph Boulton)             ]]></raw>
