<raw><![CDATA[ * Shanghai up 4 pct, set for biggest 1-day rise in 5 months * Asian stocks follow China bounce, Europe called higher * Shanghai trade still volatile on low volumes * MSCI Asia ex-Japan gains 1.4 pct, copper and gold edge up * Analysts say don't read too much into Shanghai swings By Eric Burroughs HONG KONG, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Chinese shares clawed higheron Thursday after a two-week sell-off, giving a boost to Asianstock indexes and commodities even as many investors remainedworried that the Shanghai slide may have more room to run. European shares were set to build on the gains in Asia,with futures on the Dow Jones Eurostoxx 50  up 1.4percent, while U.S. stock futures  rose 0.5 percent. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index  jumped morethan 4 percent, helped by reports that the stock regulator hadapproved new mutual funds this week to help underpin the marketthat has slid nearly 20 percent since hitting a 14-month highearlier in the month. [.HK] The gains in another day of volatile trade helped give alift to other regional shares that have been battered by suddenslumps in Shanghai this month. Japan's Nikkei average  ended 1.8 percent higher,while the MSCI benchmark of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 1.4 percent. Metals also got a lift,with copper prices recovering from a two-week low. Shanghai's impact on global markets has surprised analystsbecause it is largely closed to foreign investors and its movesare sometimes due to murky local factors having little to dowith corporate or economic fundamentals. While some investors have seen the Shanghai slide as aworrying sign about the outlook for the Chinese economy --among the strongest to power out of the global recession --many China watchers have argued that investors should not readtoo much into daily swings. [ID:nSP486694] The Shanghai index is still up more than 50 percent so farthis year, despite falling some 20 percent in just two weeks. Some market watchers suspect that state-owned companies mayhave shifted loans received earlier in the year -- tied to themore than $1 trillion of new bank lending in the first half ofthe year -- into stocks and now they are taking out those fundsto put into stimulus-related projects. "The more aggressively minded or cowboys were steeringthose funds into the market. Now that the more concreteprojects are happening, we are starting to see that moneyrotate out...," said Michael Kurtz, chief China representativeand head of China research at Macquarie Securities in Shanghai. Jerry Lou, China equity strategist at Morgan Stanley inHong Kong, said that Chinese authorities have also cracked downon the bank lending that had been funnelled into stock marketspeculation. "That's what the government wants. They don't want an assetbubble to burst too early in the recovery and then they're outof cards," Lou said. "We're not seeing the start of a bearmarket. The fundamentals are too sound." Hong Kong's Hang Seng index  rose 1.9 percent alongwith the regional rebound. In a sign that heavy share selling by short-termspeculators -- or "hot money" -- may be calming down, the HongKong dollar  recovered to near the upper end of itstight band against the U.S. dollar after hitting a two-monthlow on Wednesday. Hefty fund inflows chasing the stock surge have kept theHong Kong dollar pinned at the upper end of its band for muchof the past five months. Patrick Bennett, Asia FX and rates strategist at SocieteGenerale, said the fact that Chinese shares were having such abig influence on other markets felt like "intellectual piracy",but showed how edgy investors are on the global outlook. WORRIES REMAIN Gains in higher-yielding currencies were limited on worriesthat the volatile Chinese market was suffering a sharp bout ofprofit-taking that would resume before long. A further slidemay prompt global investors to pull out of riskier assets ingeneral. The Australian dollar edged up 0.1 percent to $0.8308 despite the broad rise in stocks after having taken ahit from the sharp drop in Shanghai shares earlier this week.Against the low-yielding yen , the Aussie was up 0.5percent. The U.S. dollar index, a gauge of the greenback'sperformance against six major currencies, was flat at 78.475. Oil prices rose 27 cents a barrel to $72.69  afterhaving surged more than 4 percent on Wednesday on data showinga sharp plunge in U.S. crude stockpiles, a jump that spilledover into shares of energy companies and helped push up the S&P500  up 0.7 percent. [O/R] Shares of Japanese oil and gas field developer Inpex<1605.T> were up 2.9 percent. Safe-haven government bonds slipped as stocks attempted tostage a recovery. Japanese government bond futures <2JGBv1> dipped 0.12 pointto 138.75 after having pushed up to a five-month high in earlytrade. The five-year JGB yield  edged up a basispoint to 0.6550 percent after touching a four-year low theprevious day. (Editing by Kim Coghill)             ]]></raw>
