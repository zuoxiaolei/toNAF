<raw><![CDATA[ * Japan PM visits tsunami-hit village, enters nuclear zone * Nuclear crisis enters fourth week, no quick solution * IMF warns economy to be hit by quake, possible yenintervention * Cracked concrete pit might be source of radiation leak (Updates with discovery of a cracked pit at Fukushima)	 By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Chisa Fujioka	 TOKYO, April 2 (Reuters) - Japan's prime minister made hisfirst visit to the country's tsunami-devastated region onSaturday as the operator of the stricken Fukushima nuclearcomplex said it had found radioactive water leaking into the seafrom a cracked concrete pit.	In a discovery regulators said might explain the radioactivewater that has hobbled efforts to quell Japan's nuclear crisis,Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) said the radiation inthe pit at its No.2 reactor in Fukushima measured 1,000millisieverts per hour. [ID:nL3E7F2039]	"With radiation levels rising in the seawater near the plant,we have been trying to confirm the reason why, and in thatcontext, this could be one source," said Hidehiko Nishiyama,deputy head of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency.	 He cautioned, however, "We can't really say for certainuntil we've studied the results."	 TEPCO is preparing to pour concrete into the pit to stop theleak, added Nishiyama.	 	 Prime Minister Naoto Kan spoke with refugees living in amakeshift camp in the fishing village of Rikuzentakata, levelledby the tsunamis which struck on March 11 when Japan was rockedby a massive earthquake, leaving 28,000 dead and missing.	 "It will be kind of a long battle, but the government willbe working hard together with you until the end. I want everyoneto do their best, too," Kan told one survivor in a school thatwas now an evacuation shelter. 	 Despite its tsunami seawalls, Rikuzentaka was flattened intoa wasteland of mud and debris and most of its 23,000 residentskilled or injured, many swept away by the waves.	 "A person that used to have a house near the coast told me'Where am I supposed to build a house after this?', so Iencouraged this person and said the government will providesupport until the end," Kan told reporters.	 Unpopular and under pressure to quit or call a snap pollbefore the disaster, Kan has been criticised for his managementof Japan's humanitarian and nuclear crisis and his leadershipremains in question.	 "There are some evacuation centres that lack electricity andwater. There are people who can't even go look for the dead. Iwant him to pay attention to them," said Kazuo Sato, a45-year-old fisherman.	 Kan later entered the 20-km (12-mile) evacuation zone andvisited J-village just inside the zone, a sports facilityserving as the headquarters for emergency teams trying to coolthe six-reactor Fukushima Daiichi plant. 		 ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES	 After three weeks, operators of the plant are no closer toregaining control of damaged reactors, as fuel rods remainoverheated and high levels of radiation flow into the sea.	 TEPCO, Asia's largest power company, has seen its shareslose 80 percent - $32 billion in market value - since thedisaster.	 Japan is facing a damages bill which may top $300 billion --the world's biggest from a natural disaster.	 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday theJapanese economy would take a short-term hit and it could notrule out further intervention for the yen. [ID:nEBE7DA00J]	 The IMF is set to cut its 2011 forecast for Japanese growthwhen it unveils updated figures on April 11 in its WorldEconomic Outlook, said IMF Japan mission chief Mahmood Pradhan.	 Japan's central bank is expected to revise down its economicassessment when it meets on April 6-7 in the wake of the crisis.	 The consequences for the world's third largest economy havealready seen manufacturing slump to a two-year low. Poweroutages and quake damage have hit supply chains and production.	 There has been growing talk of a coalition between theruling Democratic Party of Japan (LDP) and the main oppositionLiberal Democratic Party to tackle the aftermath of the crisis.	 But there has been no agreement and the Yomiuri newspapersaid opposition parties would likely insist Kan step down first.	 The government has already been battling the opposition toget laws in place to make the new budget, from April 1,workable. Kan wants an extra budget soon for reconstructionwhich would also need help from opposition parties to function.	  RADIATION BATTLE CONTINUES	 Hundreds of thousands remain homeless, sheltering inevacuation centres, as the death toll from the disaster rises.	 Thousands of Japanese and U.S. soldiers on Saturdayconducted a search for bodies using dozens of ships andhelicopters to sweep across land still under water along thenortheast coast. The teams hope when a large spring tide recedesit will make it easier to spot bodies.	 Radiation 4,000 times the legal limit has been detected inseawater near the Daiichi plant and a floating tanker was to betowed to Fukushima to store contaminated seawater. But until theplant's internal cooling system is reconnected radiation willflow from the plant.	 "We are trying to employ as many measures as possible (toput the plant under control). We are holding high hopes (forthis storage)," said a TEPCO official.	 In its attempt to bring the plant under control, TEPCO islooking for "jumpers" -- workers who, for payment of up to$5,000 a shift, will rush into highly radioactive areas to do aquick task before racing out as quickly as possible.	 "My company offered me 200,000 yen ($2,500) per day," onesubcontractor, unidentified but in his 30s, told Japan's WeeklyPost magazine. "Ordinarily I'd consider that a dream job, but mywife was in tears and stopped me, so I declined."	 TEPCO was also spraying resin onto radioactive dust in anattempt to stop it from being carried in the wind.	 "We sprayed 2,000 litres over 500 square metres of land. Weplan to evaluate the result of the test spraying on April 2ndand 3rd. It takes about 24 hours for this scattering-preventionsolution to get dried," said the official.	 It could take years, possibly decades, to make safe the areaaround the plant, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo.	 With its president, Masataka Shimizu, in hospital, anenormous compensation bill looming and mounting criticism ofboth its handling of the crisis and prior safety preparations,TEPCO may need state help, according to media reports.	 Kan has all but ruled out nationalising TEPCO but some sortof injection of public funds looks inevitable.	 Standard & Poor's on Friday cut its long-term rating onTEPCO by three notches to "BBB+", in its second downgrade on theelectric utility in as many weeks.
