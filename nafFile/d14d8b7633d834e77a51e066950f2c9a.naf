Dollar losses accelerated after a report showed U.S.private employers unexpectedly cut 39,000 jobs in Septemberafter an upwardly revised gain of 10,000 in August.[ID:nEAP103400]. The ADP payrolls processor report comes aheadof Friday's government non-farm payrolls report. A broadly weak dollar helped push the euro to aneight-month high, though the single currency pared gains afterFitch downgraded Ireland's credit rating, renewing concernsabout the fiscal health of peripheral euro zone countries.[ID:nWLA4711] Comments by Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who wasquoted as saying the central bank should do much more to spurthe economy [ID:nN05203033], also kept negative dollarsentiment firmly intact. This has intensified speculation theFed will resume quantitative easing, possibly in November. "ADP hasn't recently had that great a correlation with theofficial non-farm payrolls number," said Eric Viloria, currencystrategist at Forex.com in New York. "But it all adds to thecase for the Fed coming in to create more stimulus." Midway through the New York session, the dollar dipped aslow as 82.75 yen  on electronic trading platform EBSbefore recovering to 83.00 yen, still down 0.2 percent on theday . The session peak was only 83.27 leaving thedollar/yen trading in a tight range despite the extreme low. Wednesday's low was below the 82.87 level where the Bank ofJapan moved to weaken the yen on September 15 but investorswere not willing to push the dollar too low against the yendespite the fresh 15-year low in case of more intervention. The greenback was well below the high of 83.99 yen it hiton EBS after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced easing steps onTuesday. The dollar was down 0.2 percent against a basket ofcurrencies  at 77.568, having fallen as far as 77.556. EURO GAINS The euro gained 0.4 percent at $1.3886  in a volatilesession that saw it swing between losses and an eight-monthhigh of $1.3891 on the EBS trading platform . Optionsbarriers were said to be at the $1.3900 level. The single currency was helped earlier by data showing asurge in German manufacturing orders in August [ID:nLDE6950ZQ],leaving a potential for the single currency to test $1.40.  Technically, the euro's next target is around $1.3896 onEBS, a 61.8 percent retracement of its fall from above $1.51late last year to its June low. The 200-week moving averagestands at around $1.3920. The dollar also touched a 2-1/2 year low against the Swissfranc at 0.9620 francs  on EBS trading platform. Thisbrings it closer to the all-time low of 0.9572 hit on EBS,while it is already below the all-time low recorded on Reutersdata of 0.9674. The dollar's steady drop prompted talk of an escalatingglobal currency war, ahead of the IMF-G7 meetings this weekend,with emerging countries growing increasingly edgy about theflood of capital inflows from advanced economies. Though he did not mention any names, U.S. TreasurySecretary Timothy Geithner on Wednesday took a not-so-subtledig at China when he said that countries running big tradesurpluses need to let their currencies rise or risk triggeringa destructive round of competitive devaluations.[ID:nN06208024].

The higher-yielding Australian dollar  hitting itshighest in more than two years at $0.9781, leaving it on coursefor a test of the 2008 high of $0.9851.
