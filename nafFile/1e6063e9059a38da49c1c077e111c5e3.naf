<raw><![CDATA[ * China launches second WTO dispute with EU * EU defends move, but was controversial within bloc  (Adds Vietnam comment, Swedish study) By Jonathan Lynn and Lucy Hornby GENEVA/BEIJING, Feb 4 (Reuters) - China launched a disputeat the World Trade Organisation on Thursday against EU duties onshoes, but the European Union insisted its measures were in linewith WTO rules and denied they were protectionist. China's protest against anti-dumping duties extended inDecember was further evidence of its increasing assertiveness inthe WTO. It also indicated that despite mounting commercial tensionsaround the world between the United States, China, the EuropeanUnion and other states, the rules-based global trading system isstill working and the WTO remains the preferred forum forcountries to work out their trade differences. The dispute will be closely watched by major shoe industryplayers such as Germany's Adidas and Puma, and Nike of theUnited States, as well as smaller European players such asItaly's Geox, Denmark's Ecco and Spain's Camper. China said in a filing to the WTO on Thursday that it wasseeking consultations with the European Union over the duties,the first step in a formal dispute at the global trade arbiter. WTO rules allow members to impose extra duties on importsthat are "dumped" or sold for less than they cost at home, ifthey cause damage to business in the importing country. It is the second case China has taken to the WTO against theEuropean Union and only its seventh since joining in 2001. EU ministers voted on Dec. 22 to extend duties on shoes fromChina and Vietnam, the two biggest exporters to the EuropeanUnion, by 15 months. China had lobbied hard against the decision, which extendedduties first levied in 2006. "The European Union anti-dumping investigation and findingcontravenes relevant WTO regulations, and hurts the legitimateinterests of Chinese companies," Ministry of Commerce spokesmanYao Jian said in a statement on the ministry's website.  EU SAYS INDUSTRY HURT But the EU said its move had followed WTO rules on dumping. "The decision to impose measures was taken on the basis ofclear evidence that dumping of Chinese products has taken placeand that this is harming the otherwise competitive EU industry,"acting EU commission trade spokesman John Clancy said in astatement. The decision was controversial even within the EU. Thebloc's anti-dumping committee had rejected an extension inNovember, responding to fears of retailers and consumer groupsthat it would push up prices. Chinese- and Vietnamese-made shoes are estimated to make up30 percent of the EU market. But Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, home to manysmall shoe manufacturers, mobilised support within the EU for anextension, persuading Germany and other opponents to abstain. The economics of the shoe industry are complicated, asmanufacturing, often outsourced, makes up a relatively smallpart of the value of the product against components like designand development, still handled at home. A recent Swedish study found that a shoe manufactured inChina could still be regarded as a "European shoe", with EUadded value accounting for typically over 50 percent of alow-price show, and over 80 percent for upmarket footwear withhigh design and marketing costs. If the two sides do not resolve their differences within 60days, China can ask the WTO to rule on the case. The extended duties took effect from Jan. 3 and amount to a16.5 percent tariff on imports of Chinese leather shoes and 10percent on those made in Vietnam. An official at Vietnam's mission to the WTO said he wasaware of Beijing's move but had not received any instructionsfrom the government in Hanoi and so was unable to commentfurther. Vietnam was following the case closely, he said. (Additional reporting by Zhou Xin in Beijing; Editing by LouiseIreland)             ]]></raw>
