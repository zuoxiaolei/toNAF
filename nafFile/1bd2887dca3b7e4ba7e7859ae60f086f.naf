<raw><![CDATA[ By Caren Bohan WASHINGTON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - President Barack Obamasigned a bill on Wednesday aimed at easing costs for U.S.manufacturers by reducing tariffs on materials used to make theproducts they sell. The bill is part of a "Make it in America" agenda Obama'sDemocrats are pushing ahead of the Nov. 2 congressionalelections. Backers say the initiatives will reduce the hugeU.S. trade deficit with China and other countries by bolsteringAmerican manufacturing firms. "Our economy has fallen into the habit of buying fromoverseas and not selling the way it needs to but it is vitallyimportant that we reverse that trend," Obama told an audienceof businesspeople gathered at the White House for the billsigning. Obama said the bill would make it "cheaper and easier forAmerican manufacturers and American workers to do what they dobest: build great products and sell them around the world." The manufacturing legislation passed overwhelmingly in theU.S. Congress last month and has the support of many businessgroups. The National Association Manufacturers has said it wouldboost U.S. manufacturing output by $4.6 billion and supportabout 90,000 jobs. It would reduce or suspend tariffs on a list of rawmaterials and component parts no longer produced in the UnitedStates but used by American companies to make other products. Some examples include shoe leather used by companies suchas New Balance to make running shoes and some types of computerchips used to make computers. The global financial crisis led to a major slowdown intrade, causing the U.S. trade deficit to shrink to $375 billionin 2009 from $699 billion in 2008. As economic growth has returned, the trade gap is on therise again. A wave of consumer goods imported from China led to asurprising widening of the U.S. trade deficit in June,according to a report from the Commerce Department onWednesday. The trade gap hit $49.9 billion, the highest sinceOctober 2008. (Editing by Bill Trott and Jerry Norton)             ]]></raw>
