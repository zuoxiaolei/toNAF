<raw><![CDATA[ * Expects 10-15 percent loan portfolio growth in 2010 * Will consider borrowing $50-100 million abroad in 2011  (Adds details, quotes, background) By Maria Gordeyeva ALMATY, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Kaspi Bank, one of Kazakhstan'stop 10 lenders, plans to grow its loan portfolio by up to 15percent in a profitable 2010 and will consider foreignborrowings of up to $100 million next year, its head said. Mikhail Lomtadze, chairman of the management board, toldReuters he expected Kaspi Bank, one of the largest retaillenders in Kazakhstan, to reverse last year's net loss as theeconomy recovers from the financial crisis. "We had a small profit in the first six months of the year,and we will also have a good profit for the full year," Lomtadzesaid in an interview. Kaspi Bank posted a net loss of 6.3 billion tenge ($43million) in 2009, compared with a profit of 3.9 billion tenge inthe previous year. Kazakhstan, Central Asia's largest economy, was among thefirst and hardest hit by the global financial crisis and is onlynow beginning to recover as growth picks up and several banksemerge from lengthy debt restructuring programmes. Kaspi Bankavoided the need for a debt restructuringprogramme and did not receive state support during the crisis. The bank estimates it has a 15 percent share of Kazakhstan'sretail banking sector and its billboard advertisements aredisplayed prominently around the country's largest cities. Lomtadze said Kazakhstan's banking sector had become morepredictable after the crisis and that Kaspi Bank was capable ofboosting its loan portfolio by 10 percent to 15 percent in 2010. "Next year it will be 20 to 30 percent," he said. "Consumer demand is gradually recovering and, in somesectors, it has returned to the levels of 2007. The mostimportant thing is that the banking sector has actively begun tolend."  INTERNATIONAL BORROWING Kazakhstan's financial regulator has said the fledglingrecovery in the country's banking sector would yield only modestprofits this year and that the biggest challenge facing thesector was a shortage of solvent borrowers. Lomtadze said it would take some time before Kazakhstan'sbanks could return in force to international markets, but thathis bank might begin looking abroad next year. "The market is not ready for Kazakhstan's banks to resumeborrowing on international markets," he said. "As soon as opportunities occur and the market opens up, wewould, in principle, become a player in this sector," he said."We are interested in borrowing at favourable rates." Lomtadze said international borrowing could again becomepossible next year. "We don't have the need to borrow hundredsof millions of dollars ... At a good rate, we could borrow about$50 million to $100 million," he said. Lomtadze also said Kaspi Bank would consider expanding itsbusiness into other countries of the former Soviet Union, thoughthis would be a project for the medium to long term. "This definitely won't be in 2010 or 2011, because there isenough potential to grow here (in Kazakhstan)," he said. (Writing by Robin Paxton; Editing by Michael Shields)             ]]></raw>
