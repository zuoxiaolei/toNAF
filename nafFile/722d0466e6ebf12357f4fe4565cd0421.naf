<raw><![CDATA[ * Retail sales higher, beat market expectations * Market expects rate rise as early as April * Kiwi higher after data, bank bills ease * Manufacturing sector activity up for fourth month * Consumer confidence at three-year high (Adds PMI, consumer confidence survey) By Mantik Kusjanto WELLINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - New Zealand's retail salesrose in November as consumers showed they were much moreconfident, reinforcing market views that the central bank wouldraise interest rates from as early as April. Seasonally adjusted retail sales values rose 0.8 percentfrom the previous month, official data showed on Thursday,following two straight months of near flat performance.Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a 0.5 percent rise. Core retail sales, which exclude fuel and auto-relatedsales, also rose 0.8 percent from the previous month, betterthan market estimates for a 0.2 percent rise. Actual sales rosea bigger than expected 2.4 percent on a year ago. The release came a day after data showed benign inflationin the fourth quarter, which cooled expectations that thecentral bank might need to start raising rates from as early asMarch. "You have one weak set of data, and one strong set, but theconsumer price index is the more important. Overall, the markethas shifted its expectations from March out to April. That'sthe summary between the two," said Westpac senior strategistImre Speizer. The New Zealand dollar gained around a quarter of a cent to$0.7223 before settling back around $0.7210/20. Bank billfutures retreated as much as 7 basis points, after rallying theprevious day. Recent data has pointed to a gradually improving economy,but the central bank in its last monetary policy review said itwould hold rates until around the middle of 2010 and isexpected to repeat that outlook in its next review on Jan. 28. Two other pieces of data reinforced the view the economy isgrowing steadily. The Bank of New Zealand-Business NZ's seasonally adjustedperformance of manufacturing index (PMI) showed themanufacturing sector strengthened for the fourth month in a rowin December to a two-year high. The ANZ-Roy Morgan Consumer confidence index also rose to athree-year high in January, with respondents more upbeat aboutboth current conditions and the future outlook. "The combination of a recovery in housing and prospectivepeak in the unemployment rate in early 2010 is giving an auraof confidence," ANZ-National chief economist Cameron Bagriesaid. Consumers curbed their spending in the past year in theface of falling property prices, and a deep and protractedrecession, which was exacerbated by the global financialcrisis. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) slashed rates by 575basis points between July 2008 and April 2009 to a record low2.5 percent to drive the economy out of recession. That helped the economy post  growth of 0.2 percent in thesecond and third quarters after five straight quarters ofcontraction.
