<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro hits 11-mth high above 120 yen * Dudley's dovish comments take shine off dollar * Aussie rises to fresh 29-year high at $1.0422 By Natsuko Waki	 TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - The euro held below this week'sfive-month high against the dollar and 11-month peak versus theyen on Tuesday as investors paused to assess how much it canmake in fresh gains given that expectations for interest raterises have largely been priced in.	 The European Central Bank is expected to raise interestrates by a quarter point from a record low of 1 percent at itsmeeting on Thursday to rein in inflationary pressures, with twomore 25 basis point hikes priced in by the year-end .	 But the single currency has already risen more than sixpercent against the dollar and over 10 percent versus the yenthis year, making investors reluctant to buy more ahead ofThursday's meeting.	 Uncertainty over Federal Reserve policy also promptedinvestors to stay on the sidelines ahead of the release of theminutes of its March 15 meeting.	 "For the ECB, an April interest rate hike is a done deal andone or two more hikes are priced in. It's hard to see a positivesurprise from here," said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategistat Barclays Bank.	 "Still, the euro zone would be the first to raise interestrates, which supports the euro. Expectations for diversificationflows from higher oil prices are also positive. There is also arisk that the Fed minutes may show a hawkish tone."	 The euro stood at $1.4228 , having risen to a higharound $1.4268 on Monday. A rise above resistance at $1.4281,the November high, would open the way to $1.4450. Support isseen at $1.4190, with traders citing stops through to below$1.4150.	 Traders also noted trendline resistance drawn from theeuro's record high set in July 2008 coming in around $1.4300. 	 The euro was up around 0.2 percent at 119.76 yen ,close to its 11-month peak above 120.05 hit on Monday.	 The dollar ticked higher to 84.19 yen , edging closerto a six-month peak of 84.72 set on Friday before stalling aheadof option barriers at 84.75. A 200-day moving average at around83.55 is now seen acting as support.	  FED POLICY	 Investors are focusing on the Fed minutes to give more clueson the future direction of monetary policy after policymakerssuggested on Monday the Fed is likely to keep its $600 billionasset purchase programme until June.	 On Monday, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said U.S.inflation was likely to remain moderate and St.Louis Fed Research Director Christopher Waller said the Fed waslikely to buy all the bonds it has said it would purchase byJune 30. [ID:nN04277975] 	 Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Federal ReserveBank, told CNBC on Monday the Fed's programme is most likely an"adequate" size. [ID:nWEN0460]  	 "It is becoming increasingly evident (there is) a divergencein opinions among Fed members. These different opinions amongFed members may seep into the FOMC minutes later today," BNPParibas said in a note to clients.	 "This may be interpreted as hawkish, but we expect the Fedto stand pat especially since we expect incoming data through Q2to be on the weaker side."	 The Bank of Japan is likely to downgrade its economicassessment and keep policy ultra-loose on Wednesday, a factorthat is keeping the yen under pressure.
