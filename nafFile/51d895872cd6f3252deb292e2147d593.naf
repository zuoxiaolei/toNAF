The MSCI stock index for Latin America plunged as much as 9.3 percent in the worst moment of the daybut trimmed losses later amid talk that the panic selling wastriggered by an erroneous trade from a big Wall Street bank. Regardless of any possible trade glitch, global aversion torisk grew further as investors worried the European CentralBank was failing to stop Greece's debt crisis from spreadingalong the euro zone. Emerging market risk spreads hit their widest levels inthree months as foreign investors sold the most liquid assetsin the region, including the currencies of Brazil and Mexico. "A lot of people who had been in carry positions aregetting stopped out. At the moment everything with riskassociated with it is getting crushed," said Doug Smith, chiefeconomist for the Americas at Standard Chartered Bank in NewYork. The Brazilian real  ended 2.86 percent weaker at1.851 per U.S. dollar after slumping about 5 percent earlier inthe day. The Mexican peso  sank 1.95 percent to asix-month low of 12.9855 per greenback. Latin American markets started the day under pressure afterECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said the bank's governingcouncil had finished its meeting in Lisbon without discussing apossible purchase of European government debt. Many investors would like to see the ECB buy bonds issuedby weaker euro zone members such as Greece to support pricesand boost market confidence. For details, see [ID:nLDE6450H7]. "The market was expecting something clear from the ECB butit did not get it," said Daniela Blancas, a currency strategistat Scotia Capital in Mexico City. Although economic fundamentals continue to improve in LatinAmerica, Europe's debt problems have triggered a globalreduction in risk appetite. Yield spreads between emerging market bonds and U.S.Treasuries, an important gauge of risk aversion, widened 28basis points to 323 basis points, their widest since earlyFebruary, according to the JPMorgan EMBI+ index <11EMJ>.
