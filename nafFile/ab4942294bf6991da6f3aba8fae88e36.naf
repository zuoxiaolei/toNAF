<raw><![CDATA[ * Nintendo to launch 3DS in Feb in Japan, March in U.S. * 3DS to cost 25,000 yen in Japan; U.S. price not revealed * 3DS launch lags Sony and Microsoft motion gaming add-ons * Nintendo shares drop 3.7 pct after announcement * Nintendo cuts earnings forecast; blames lower DS sales, yen (Adds analyst comment) By Isabel Reynolds and Reiji Murai CHIBA, Japan, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Nintendo Co Ltd said onWednesday the launch of its 3D-capable DS handheld game playerwill miss the busy year-end holiday shopping season, forcingJapan's leading game machine maker to slash its full-year profitforecast by one-third. Nintendo will launch the new version of the DS on Feb. 26 inJapan and in March in the United States, by far the biggestmarket for the game machine maker. The company trimmed its projection for overall DS sales forthe year to March 31 to 23.5 million units from 30 million andlowered its estimate for Wii consoles to 17.5 million machinesfrom 18 million. "At first we thought it would be desirable to launch the 3DSwithin the year, so we made our forecasts on that basis. At thispoint it is clear that if we launch within the year, we will notbe able to supply enough units," Nintendo President Satoru Iwatatold an analysts' conference. SMARTPHONE THREAT With sales of its DS and Wii fading, Nintendo is relying onthe new 3D model to revive profits and help it fend of renewedcompetition from Sony Corp and Microsoft, whose motion-gamingperipherals will be on the market in time for year-end shoppersto buy. Nintendo also faces growing competition from smartphones andother devices that can be used to play games."Without doubt, it hurts to miss the year-end shoppingseason," said Kazutaka Oshima, president of Rakuten InvestmentManagement and an avid gamer. "Game-only consoles are facing an increasingly uphill battleagainst smartphones like iPhones and other gadgets, since morepeople are playing games on them. But I think the 3D DS canattract people," he added. "It should be fun to watch Mario runand jump on a 3D screen." Nintendo's Super Mario game franchise celebrated its 25thanniversary earlier this month. The new 3DS created buzz when it was revealed at the E3 gameshow in the United States earlier this year, bolsteringexpectations that it would be the new hit product Nintendo needs. Iwata said at the launch event that the new games machine,which can also be used to take 3D photos and view them withoutspecial glasses, will cost 25,000 yen ($298) in Japan. That compares with retail prices of about 12,000 to 16,000yen for existing DS models. The pricier model, however, will come too late to prop upthis business year's sagging profits. Nintendo, also blaming a strong yen that has trimmed thevalue of its overseas earnings, cut its annual operating profitforecast by one-third to 210 billion yen ($2.51 billion). For thesix months ending on Sept. 30, the company now expects operatingprofit of 50 billion yen compared with an earlier estimate for120 billion yen. Shares of Nintendo dropped on the announcement of the DSrelease and ended trading down 3.7 percent at 23,010 yen. Nintendo did not reveal the price or exact launch date forthe 3D DS in the United States.
