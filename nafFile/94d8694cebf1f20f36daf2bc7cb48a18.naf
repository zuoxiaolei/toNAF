<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The pound was little changed close to two-week lows against the dollar on Monday as concerns over the U.K. economic outlook weighed ahead of data on first quarter growth later in the week.GBP/USD hit 1.5205 during European afternoon trade, the pair’s lowest since April 5; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.5226, dipping 0.02%.Cable was likely to find support at 1.5098, the low of April 2 and resistance at 1.5311, Thursday’s high.The pound remained under pressure as concerns over a triple-dip recession and the prospect of more easing weighed by the Bank of England weighed.Fitch’s ratings agency downgraded the U.K.’s triple-A rating by one notch to AA+ with a stable outlook on Friday, in the light of "the weak growth performance of the U.K. economy in recent years".The downgrade came after the International Monetary Fund warned early last week that the British government should scale back its austerity program, given current weakness in the U.K. economy.Sterling was slightly higher against the euro, with EUR/GBP slipping 0.10% to 0.8559.Sentiment on the single currency remained fragile amid fears that weak purchasing managers’ index data on Tuesday could intensify speculation over a possible rate cut by the European Central Bank.Earlier Monday, ECB Vice-President Vitor Constancio said a rate cut is always a possibility and is dependent on economic data.             ]]></raw>
