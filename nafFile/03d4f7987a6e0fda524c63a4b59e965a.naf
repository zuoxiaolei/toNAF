<raw><![CDATA[   * Treasury, corporate bond purchases fall in May * U.S. still sees long-term, overall inflows * China cuts holding, official sources post record outflow (Adds comment, detail) By Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Foreigners in May boughtfewer long-term U.S. securities, including government andcorporate bonds, and China cut its U.S. Treasury holdings forthe first time in three months, the Treasury said on Friday. Net long-term capital inflows into the United States fellto $35.4 billion in May from a downwardly revised $81.5 billioninflow in April. Purchases of Treasury notes and bonds fell sharply, withforeigners buying a net $14.9 billion in May after snapping up$76.4 billion in April. China cut its Treasury holdings by $32.5 billion to $867.7billion, though it remained the largest single holder of U.S.government debt. Japan, the second largest holder, also reducedits Treasury stash by $8.8 billion to $786.7 billion. Official -- or government -- investors were net sellers ofall U.S. assets in May to the tune of $38.8 billion, a recordaccording to Treasury. Private investors bought a net $56.2billion of U.S. assets. Though neither Treasury nor currency traders reacted to thereport, some analysts urged investors to watch future releasesfor more evidence of weaker demand from foreign central banks. "The pullback in foreign purchases of Treasuries may feedconcern on the ability of the U.S. to finance its deficits" ata time when yields are at depressed levels, said Todd Elmer, asenior currency strategist at Citigroup in New York.  The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note ended Mayyielding 3.29 percent and had fallen as low as 2.88 percent byJuly, a 14-month low. Nomura Securities rates strategist Stanley Sun, however,noted that China was mainly a seller of Treasury bills andactually bought a net $3 billion in long-term Treasuries. OVERALL NET INFLOWS RISE Net overall capital inflows into the United States, whichinclude short-term securities such as Treasury bills, edged upto $17.5 billion in May from the prior month's $13 billion. Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global FX at BNYMellon in Boston, said the search for higher returns likelysoured foreigners on longer-dated securities. "U.S. assets really haven't been up there among thepreferences of portfolio managers. Emerging market equities andsuch have been in greater demand," he said. "There does seem to be some willingness by central banks todiversify, but it's diversification away from both the dollarand the euro toward the likes of the Canadian and Australiandollars, and that's consistent with the trend," Shankar added. After buying a net $10.1 billion of corporate bonds inApril, foreign investors became net sellers in May to the tuneof $9 billion. Equities also saw a mild net outflow of $432million after attracting a $9.6 billion net inflow in April. Net purchases of U.S. agency debt, however, rose to $27.4billion in May from $14.3 billion the prior month. In May,agencies traded between 24 and 29 basis points above U.S.Treasuries.
