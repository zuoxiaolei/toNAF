<raw><![CDATA[ * Market tests Japan's willingness to intervene * U.S. consumer confidence better than expected in August * Euro hits record low against Swiss franc(Adds detail, updates prices) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The yen neared a 15-year highagainst the dollar on Tuesday as investors shrugged off theBank of Japan's latest easing move, betting on yen gains thatwould again test authorities' readiness to intervene. Mounting U.S. economic concerns are likely to keepinvestors away from riskier assets and push up the safe-havenyen. That could eventually prompt Japan to sell its currency inthe markets for the first time in more than six years. "The policy action by the BoJ isn't going to change themarket's mood. It would probably take intervention to shakethings up a bit," said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategistat Wells Fargo in New York. "But we're not even sure that wouldcause a sustained reversal of yen strength." The dollar got a little support from data showing U.S.consumer confidence rose modestly in August, lifted by a mildimprovement in the short-term outlook. See [ID:nN31236324] In mid-morning trading, the dollar was down 0.2 percent at84.45 yen . It had earlier fallen to 84.06, according toReuters data, not far from its 15-year low of 83.58 set onelectronic trading platform EBS last week. "We got a surprisingly nice number from consumerconfidence, given that sentiment has been so negative lately,"said John Doyle, senior strategist at Tempus Consulting inWashington. But he added that while the data paints a slightly rosierpicture for the U.S., the trend is still for softer growth.Investors will scrutinize the minutes from the FederalReserve's most recent policy meeting due out later in the dayand jobs data on Friday for more clues about the economy, hesaid. The euro rose 0.5 percent against the dollar to $1.2726, helped in part by strong job numbers from Germany.[ID:nLDE67U0IQ] Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated onTuesday that the government would take decisive action oncurrencies -- usually seen as code for intervention -- whennecessary. But the reaction in the market was limited. On Monday, the Bank of Japan expanded cheap loans to banks,a move seen as a symbolic gesture that will do little to haltthe currency's climb. "These measures seem more suited to dealing with thenegative economic effects of yen strength, rather than directlyaddressing the currency, suggesting more than a littlehesitation in meeting the issue head-on at current dollar/yenvaluations," said Sacha Tihanyi, currency strategist at ScotiaCapital in Toronto. The dollar has fallen 2.3 percent against the yen thismonth and is down more than 9 percent this year. Traders say Japanese authorities are expected to buy thedollar against the yen if the dollar slides 3-4 yen in one day.For Q+A on whether Japan will intervene to curb the yen's rise,click on [ID:nTOE67U05E].
