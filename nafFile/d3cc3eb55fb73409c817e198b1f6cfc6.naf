<raw><![CDATA[ * Demand for yen, Swiss franc stalls as stock markets bounce * Analysts expect economic weakness to underpin safe havens * Traders await Bernanke speech at Fed gathering (Releads, adds comment, updates prices)  By Neal Armstrong LONDON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - A rally in safe-haven currenciessuch as the yen and the Swiss franc stalled on Thursday asglobal share prices bounced, although worries about the globaleconomy slowing down were likely to keep them supported. The yen was also weighed down by speculation Bank of JapanGovernor Masaaki Shirakawa might comment on the yen or monetarypolicy at a Federal Reserve retreat later this week. European shares  rose 0.6 percent, clawing back froma five-week low on forecast-beating results and tracking a risein U.S. and Asian markets. But analysts said the bettersentiment was unlikely to be sustained. "I would expect weaker economic activity to catch up withstock markets and demand for currencies such as the Swiss francand the yen to continue," said Chris Turner, head of FX strategyat ING.    Increasing concerns in the past few months about a globaleconomic slowdown have pushed the yen and Swiss franc higher dueto their perceived safe-haven status. The euro hovered near anall-time low versus the Swiss franc hit on Wednesday . At 1142 GMT, the euro  traded with gains of around 0.2percent versus the yen  at 107.23 yen, having made abrief show above 108 yen earlier on a bounce in European stocks. The euro hit a nine-year low on Tuesday at 105.44 yen. Against the Swiss franc, the euro was steady at 1.3035francs , hovering near an all-time low hit on Wednesdayunder 1.3000. The euro hit a session high against the dollar  of$1.2746 before pulling back to around $1.2695. It hovered abovea six-week trough hit earlier in the week. Gains in the euro helped push the dollar  down 0.3percent against a currency basket. The euro flirted with its 55-day and 100-day moving averagesat $1.2713 and $1.2737 respectively. A close above these levelswould add to upward momentum. High-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar andthe New Zealand dollar outperformed the euro, aided by thebounce in equities. The dollar was steady versus the yen  at 84.50 yen. Earlier this week it hit a 15-year low of 83.58 yen asinvestors tested whether Japanese authorities would go beyondtrying to talk down the yen.  JACKSON HOLE Traders said the market was well contained on caution aboutpossible Japanese intervention, while many investors remained onthe sideline. The BOJ saying Shirakawa will attend the Kansas City FederalReserve conference in Jackson Hole this week has made someplayers hesitant to push the yen higher. [ID:nTKV006403] "Shirakawa is likely to speak to (Federal Reserve ChairmanBen) Bernanke and other central bankers in Jackson Hole, andthat is prompting market players to speculate about possibleJapanese action," said Hideki Amikura, deputy general manager ofthe forex section at Nomura Trust and Banking in Tokyo. Speculation has grown that Japan may intervene to stem theyen's rise for the first time since March 2004. It hit anall-time high of 79.75 to the dollar in 1995. Bernanke will speak in Jackson Hole on Friday, and is likelyto signal his views about the U.S. economy, but analysts say heis unlikely to offer clues to the Fed's policy outlook.
