<raw><![CDATA[ By Steven Scheer JERUSALEM, April 12 (Reuters) - Israeli interest rates arecurrently low and still have room to rise further sinceinflation remains high, a senior Bank of Israel official said onTuesday. But financial markets should not try to determine a patternin the pace or size of each move, said Barry Topf, head of themarket operations division at the central bank. "The human urge is for pattern recognition but it is simplynot useful in interpreting monetary policy," Topf said in aninterview with Reuters. "Obviously, we don't want to take abruptsteps but we want to take steps we feel are appropriate." The Bank of Israel on March 28 boosted its benchmark rate bya more than expected half-point to 3 percent for its thirdstraight monthly move and ninth since August 2009. Minutes of the decision showed a split among bank officials,with two of the four lobbying for a quarter-point hike plusfurther measures to cool the housing market. [ID:nLDE73A0U0] "There could be macro-prudential steps in the future. We areweighing them, considering them and formulating them but weweigh and design lots of things that don't necessarily getdone," said Topf, who last week was named senior adviser onmonetary policy to Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer. Topf will also be a voting member of the new monetary policycouncil currently being formulated. He defended the half-pointincrease as necessary to maintain the Bank of Israel'scredibility in fighting inflation. "The fact we raised rates 50 basis points was a surprise butone has to look where the interest rate is at the moment. At 3percent, they are still low and monetary policy is stillsupportive of economic activity," he said, pointing to realrates being zero to slightly negative. Annual inflation reached a 4.2 percent rate in February andis forecast to have risen to a 28-month peak of 4.4 percent inMarch. Inflation expectations published last month alsoindicated inflation would stay near 4 percent for the next yearto stay above a government target of 1 to 3 percent. "Inflation is currently higher than we like it to be," Topfsaid. "But we fully expect it to come down in the medium term,which is what we are aiming for." Inflation expectations "have definitely gone down since thelast interest rate increase", he said without elaborating. The Bank of Israel will next publish data on inflationexpectations for the coming years on April 21. Topf said the process of bringing rates to a more normallevel is a slow and gradual process and a function of economicdevelopments. Most analysts project another one-point oftightening this year to 4 percent and reaching more than 5percent in 2012. They peaked at 4.25 percent in 2008. "The pace is not necessarily fixed," he said. "We arelooking ahead and not just responding month by month to thelatest CPI figures but trying to see how they (rates) willaffect the economy down the road." Rate moves, he said, impact housing prices in a lag of up toa year. Housing prices have jumped over the past two years butTopf said there were some signs the market is starting to cool.However, "there is an increase in worries about oil andcommodity prices." The Bank of Israel's new six-member monetary policy councilis expected to start in the next few months and Topf expectsthere to be a better degree of accountability and transparencyto the public. At present, the governor alone takes monetarypolicy decisions. (Editing by Stephen Nisbet)             ]]></raw>
