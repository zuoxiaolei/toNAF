<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro zone Jan economic sentiment 106.5 vs 106.6 in Dec * Inflation expectations 12 months ahead soar * Business climate indicator rising close to highs  (Recasts with economists' comments)  By Jan Strupczewski BRUSSELS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentimentwas broadly flat in January against the previous month, pointingto a firm start to 2011, but also to growth differences withinthe currency area which might pose a problem for ECB policy. The European Commission's monthly survey showed economicsentiment among the 17 countries using the euro eased to 106.5this month from 106.6 in December. This was below economists' expectations of a rise to 107.0in a Reuters poll, but still seen as a decent pace, especiallygiven that the December number was revised upwards from 106.2. "The figures suggest that the euro area on average is stillon a modest recovery path. But obviously the data also show thatthe divergence between the member countries remains large," saidJuergen Michels, economist at Citigroup. While sentiment in industry rose to 6.0 points from arevised 4.9 in December, sentiment in the services sector fellto 9.2 from 9.6 and among consumers to -11.2 from -11.0.  The retail sector showed the biggest drop in optimism to 0.1from 4.5 while sentiment in the construction sector improvedmarginally to -26.0 from -26.5. "The bad news is that the growth differences between theeuro area countries are still very large. The key question is:For how long will the European Central Bank take the situationin the crisis countries into account and leave its key rates atthe current, very low level?" said Christoph Weil, economist atCommerzbank. Sentiment in Greece rose to 75.6 from 73.3, but remainedwell below the long-term average of 100. No data was available for Ireland, but in Portugal sentiment eased to 91.2 from 91.9and in Spain it inched up to 91.3 from 91.1. German sentiment, on the other hand, despite an easing to115.6 from 117.3 remained high above the long-term average. "The figures show that the German economy is quicklyovercoming the crisis, while the peripherals are continuing tolag behind," Weil said. "Low interest rates will fuel growth further in thewell-performing countries, above all in Germany. In contrast,the monetary stimulus is largely offset by the fallout from theburst real-estate bubbles and reinforced consolidation effortsin the crisis countries," he said. The ECB's task in deciding when to move its benchmarkinterest rate off a record low of 1.0 percent may not be madeany easier by the sharp rise in inflation expectations amongeuro zone households in January and selling price expectationsamong manufacturers. The European Central Bank expects inflation, which was 2.2percent year-on-year in December, to rise even further in thecoming months, but then to ease in the second half of the year. The ECB wants to keep inflation below but close to 2 percentand economists said the diverging growth rates combined with arise in inflation expectations could make monetary policy-makingmore difficult. "If the recovery continues at a stronger pace than the ECBexpected it is going to give them a headache," said CarstenBrzeski, economist at ING bank.  The Commission's business climate indicator for the eurozone, which points to the phase of the business cycle, rose to1.58 from 1.38 in December.  "The level of the indicator is approaching the historicalpeak reached in spring 2007, suggesting that the recovery inindustry will continue in the coming months," the Commissionsaid in a statement. But economists said the Commission inflation expectationssurvey was not crucial to ECB decision making as the bank tendedto rely more on polls looking further into the future fromprofessional forecasters. ABN AMRO's chief euro zone economist Nick Kounis said theCommission survey on inflation tended to lag real inflationdevelopments in recent months, and might therefore be reflectingmore past inflation rises than future trends.
