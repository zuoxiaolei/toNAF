<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro gives ground, talk hedge funds selling into rallies * Aussie on the defensive, stops above $0.8365 * Aussie trims losses after fall on Rio Tinto comments * Euro/Aussie pair higher as carry trades unwound By Kaori Kaneko TOKYO, May 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Monday asinvestors sold into its latest bounce, while the Australiandollar dropped as unwinding of carry trades funded in the singlecurrency continued on concerns markets would remain volatile. After last week's flare-up, when the euro hit a four-yearlow, investors were still cutting risk in their portfolios asthey waited for markets to calm down and the Australian dollarshed 0.5 percent against the dollar and the low-yielding yen. The Aussie's losses also deepened after miner Rio Tinto saida mining tax had damaged Australia's investment reputation, butit came back off the lows as stocks in China, with whichAustralia has close trade ties, rose 3 percent. Even though the Aussie is seen as having scope to reboundpossibly above $0.8400, it remains vulnerable, with Aussie/dollar1-mth risk reversals showing an extreme bias for puts in theoptions market. The euro too remains vulnerable, as its short-covering bounceruns out of steam, and one trader said there was talk that hedgefunds were still selling into its rallies against the dollar. "The currency market focus is still the euro zone's fiscaltrouble, but wariness about its impact on the global economyseems to be spreading, making investors increasingly riskaverse," said Jun Kato, senior manager for investment at ShinkinAsset Management. The euro fell to $1.2500 in Asian trade, down 0.6 percentfrom late New York business on Friday. Last week it hit a four-year low of $1.2143 and then snappedback to post its first weekly gain against the dollar in sixweeks. But worries about the health of Europe's banking sectorwere expected to check further gains, with resistance pencilledin at Friday's high of about $1.2670. At the weekend, the Bank of Spain said it was taking over therunning of Spanish savings bank CajaSur after its planned mergerwith another lender failed. That weighed on the euro, already hurt by worries about theimpact of deep public spending cuts in Greece, Spain andPortugal. It slipped to 112.72 yen, down 0.3 percent from New York onFriday when it jumped more than 1.0 percent. EURO VS AUSSIE Speculators trimmed some of the record high short positionsagainst the euro in the week ended May 18.. Still, traders saidthe euro was likely to struggle in the short term. "The euro is still vulnerable structurally as the shortcovering that we saw last week seems to have run its course,"said Tony Morriss, senior currency strategist at ANZ Bank. "Alsothe unwinding of carry trades that lifted the euro against theAussie last week could run into some resistance." The euro rebounded sharply against the high-yielding Aussielast week, hitting a three-month high around A$1.5456 on the backof a huge sell-off by hedge funds. On Monday, the pair wastrading at A$1.5100, not far from that peak. Charts indicate the euro/Aussie pair put in a weekly keyreversal last week and if it closes above A$1.4777 this month, itwill put the pair in line for a monthly key reversal. That wouldnot bode well for the Australian dollar. The Aussie fell 0.5 percent to $0.8281, with tradersreporting sizable buy stops above $0.8365. Those stops areexpected to be taken out this week, which could push the Aussieto $0.8425 before it turns down once again. Positioning in the options market also points to more painfor the currency. Markets now favour Aussie/dollar puts by over 5percent, partly reflecting a growing need among investors tohedge against further declines. The dollar index rose 0.4 percent to 85.71, helped mainly bythe greenback's rise against the euro and the yen. The dollarinched up 0.1 percent to 90.17 yen.
