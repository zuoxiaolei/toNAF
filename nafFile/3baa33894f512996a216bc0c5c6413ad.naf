<raw><![CDATA[ * U.S. commerce, energy secretaries to hold talks in China * US companies face high tariffs on some exports to China * Weak intellectual property rights protection a US worry By Doug Palmer SAN FRANCISCO, July 13 (Reuters) - The United States willpress China this week to lower its tariffs on clean energytechnology as one of many steps the two countries can take tofight global warming, U.S. officials said on Monday. "Both China and the U.S. have much to lose from potentiallydevastating impacts of climate change, but much to gain bypartnering to develop clean energy technologies that will powerour economy by cutting carbon emissions," David Sandalow,assistant secretary of energy for policy and internationalaffairs policy, told reporters in telephone conference call. He spoke shortly before U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chuand Commerce Secretary Gary Locke were headed to China toexplore ways the world's two biggest greenhouse gas emitterscould work together to address climate change. Locke, who was departing from San Francisco, wants to begintalks "on how to accelerate and enhance the role of the privatesector in driving cooperation, investment and trade in cleanenergy," Travis Sullivan, policy director for CommerceDepartment, told reporters. The two countries have tremendous trade opportunities inareas such as wind power, energy efficiency, clean coal andmodernizing the electric grid, but U.S. companies face hightariffs on some exports, Sullivan said. They also worry about Chinese practices that favor domesticcompanies and weak intellectual property rights protection thatputs their patented products at risk, he said. At the same time, Locke will listen to China's concernsabout U.S. export controls that restrict sales of somehigh-technology goods, Sullivan said. This week's talks set the stage for "possible agreements inthe weeks and months ahead," Sandalow said. But he emphasized Locke and Chu are not going to China "tonegotiate the details of the new climate treaty" that countriesare striving to conclude this December in Copenhagen. Many experts believe close cooperation, perhaps even abilateral deal, between the United States and China is neededfor the Copenhagen meeting to succeed. But so far, China is resisting setting a hard cap ongreenhouse gas emissions that many believe is necessary for theU.S. Senate to approve any climate treaty. "We think China needs to make a significant commitment ...in order to address the climate problem," Sandalow said, notingthat the country is "already doing a lot to cut emissions" andto boost energy efficiency. "It has strong goals with respect to renewable energy andnuclear, but both our countries are going to have to do more inthe years and decades ahead," Sandalow said.
