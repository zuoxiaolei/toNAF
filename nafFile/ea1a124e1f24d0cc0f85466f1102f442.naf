<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro retreats to one-week low versus U.S. dollar * Investors await FOMC minutes for insight into easing * Dollar hovers around 82 yen, near 15-year lows(Adds quote, detail, changes byline, changes dateline, previousLONDON) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged higheragainst the euro on Tuesday on a short-covering bounce asinvestors awaited minutes from the Federal Reserve's latestmeeting for clues on the central bank's stance towardpurchasing more assets to stimulate the economy. The dollar has sold off sharply in recent weeks, pushingthe euro as high as $1.4030, as expectations heightened thatthe Federal Reserve would pump more cheap money in the economyas early as next month. But dollar selling has eased since late last week after theeuro failed to hold above the $1.40 area, prompting investorsto get out of some of their massive short positions in thegreenback. "We had a very dramatic move, with session after session ofeuro hitting new highs," said Camilla Sutton, senior currencystrategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. "We will be in for asmall period of rest here before it has a catalyst to push ithigher still." Investors also covered stretched short positions in thedollar as they scaled back some of their more aggressive QEexpectations. Fed minutes are scheduled to be released at 2p.m.. (1800 GMT) A Reuters poll of U.S. primary dealers conducted last weekforecast a new round of quantitative easing would range between$500 billion and $1.5 trillion, with market players also keento assess whether the Fed will adopt a "drip-feed" or"shock-and-awe" approach. "I think it has the opportunity to disappoint people. It'sgoing to focus on incremental changes in policy," said MarkMcCormick, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman inNew York. "A lot of people are starting to get a little bitconcerned. We saw that consolidation starting to take place onFriday and it seems to have rolled over into today as well," headded. The euro fell as low as $1.3775 on trading platform EBS,its lowest level since Oct. 5 and a further pull-back from amore than eight-month high of $1.4030 hit last week. The euro last traded down 0.3 percent at $1.3827, withtraders highlighting a large option expiry at $1.3800 whichcould serve to contain the euro into the 1400 GMT optioncut-off. The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, which tracks thegreenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.3 percentto 77.651, after hitting a nine-month low of 76.906 last week. YEN NEAR 15-YEAR HIGHS The dollar dipped against the yen, pressured by fallingU.S. Treasury yields. The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 81.86 yen, not far from a15-year low of 81.37 struck on Monday. Most market playersexpect pressure to remain on the dollar/yen pair, with a testof 80 yen and the record trough of 79.75 yen still in sight. Analysts said the risk of another round of intervention toweaken the yen seemed to have increased after Japan weatheredthe flurry of weekend G7 and IMF meetings last weekend withhardly any criticism of its recent yen sales. Falling stock prices also helped boost risk aversion andweighed on yen crosses. The euro fell 0.6 percent to 113.23 yen and the Australiandollar was also down 0.4 percent at 80.40 yen.
