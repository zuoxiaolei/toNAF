The European reports contrasted with the United States,where disappointing retail sales cast a shadow over ananticipated rebound in consumer spending in the third quarter.A separate report showing the number of jobless U.S. workersfiling jobless claims rose unexpectedly last week furtherweighed on the dollar. The U.S. data came a day after the Federal Reserve gave itsclearest statement so far that it saw the U.S. recessionnearing an end. "The euro is advancing against the dollar this morning,having received a shot in the arm from stronger-than-expectedeuro-zone second-quarter GDP data," said Vassili Serebriakov,currency strategist at Wells Fargo Bank in New York. Midway through the New York session, the euro was up 0.5percent on the day at $1.4275, after rising as high as 1.4321,its highest in a week, according to Reuters data. Against theyen, the euro fell 0.1 percent to 136.14 yen. The dollar fell 0.7 percent versus the yen to 95.37, givingup all gains on the day after the U.S. data. The dollar index,which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, fell0.5 percent to 78.436, near a week-long low of 78.235 touchedearlier in the session. Both the German and French economies expanded 0.3 percentin the April-to-June quarter, compared with expectations forfurther contraction. Other data showed the entire 16-nationeuro bloc posted a modest 0.1 percent contraction. The euro climbed after the data, but analysts said marketswere brushing off some of the less rosy readings on grossdomestic product. Despite the slight quarterly contraction, theeuro zone economy shrank 4.6 percent from a year ago. The U.S. Commerce Department said total retail sales edgeddown 0.1 percent in July after increasing a revised 0.8 percentin June. Sales in June were initially reported to have risen0.6 percent. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales wouldrise 0.7 percent in July, on an expected boost from thegovernment's "cash for clunkers" program that gives consumersmoney to swap aging gas-guzzlers for new, more fuel efficientmodels. "The decline in the headline number for retail sales,despite much talk of the 'cash for clunkers' program, came as abig disappointment," said Matthew Strauss, senior currencystrategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. "I'm notsurprised to see the dollar giving up its earlier gains versusthe yen as investors are flocking to the Japanese currency as asafe haven." Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefitsclimbed 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 558,000 in the weekended Aug. 8 from 554,000 the prior week, the Labor Departmentsaid. Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian and NewZealand dollars gained more than 1 percent each, extendinggains made the previous day. MONETARY POLICY IN FOCUS Sterling rose 0.6 percent to $1.6575, recovering from atwo-week low touched on Wednesday, when the government reportedthe UK jobless rate hit a three-year high and the Bank ofEngland's inflation report suggested that markets wereexpecting rates to rise too early. The Fed held its benchmark rate near zero on Wednesday andsaid it would likely stay there for an extended period to guidethe way to recovery. It also said the economy was showing signsof leveling out, which boosted risk sentiment. Still, a degree of caution remained over the Fed's move toextend the time frame of asset purchases as it indicated theeconomy was still vulnerable, analysts said. "The problem with Fed statement is that the market can readinto it what it wants, leaving both sides content. ... Hence,for now it is still unclear which way the USD will jump," saidStuart Bennett, senior FX strategist at Calyon in London.
