<raw><![CDATA[ * Ukraine in talks on Association agreement with EU * But says free trade zone terms would hit budget hard  YALTA, Ukraine, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Ukraine would needbillions of euros in investment to compensate for losses in theevent of it entering a free trade zone with the European Union,President Viktor Yanukovich said on Friday. The ex-Soviet republic is in active talks with the EU blocto sign an Association agreement, of which the free trade zoneis the core. "Our strategic task is to sign an Association agreement withthe European Union ... But Ukraine's wish alone is not enough toset up this free trade zone," Yanukovich told an internationalconference in the Ukrainian Black Sea resort of Yalta. "Ukraine has no alternative to the European choice, but asthe European Union is not even ready to discuss Ukrainianmembership, we will select the pace, the forms and the methodsof integration in accordance with our national interests," hesaid. Ukraine, whose main exports are agriculture, metal andchemical products, needs access to the lucrative European marketto help local industries upgrade obsolete technologies. But Yanukovich said the latest proposals by the EU were toodifficult for Ukraine to accept. He said EU proposals to lift all duties for European goodsimported into Ukraine would cost the budget about 20 percent inlost income from customs payments. He said Ukraine could compensate for the loss by an increasein its agriculture exports to the EU, but the country neededlarge investments to make this possible.
