<raw><![CDATA[ FRANKFURT, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Recent data has been strongerthan expected but due partly to temporary factors and theEuropean Central Bank still expects the euro zone's economicrecovery to be moderate and uneven, President Jean-ClaudeTrichet said on Thursday.  "Recent economic data for the euro area have been strongerthan expected, partly owing to temporary factors," Trichet tolda news conference after the ECB kept its main interest rate onhold at 1.0 percent. "Looking ahead, the recovery should proceed at a moderatepace with uncertainty still prevailing." He said the most recent data and survey evidence havelargely comfirmed expectations for a moderation of growth in thesecond half of the year. The euro zone grew 1.0 percent in the second quarter,according to Eurostat's preliminary reading, although thebreakdown by country points to a lopsided recovery. Germany grew at its fastest rate since reunification in thesecond quarter and more than twice as fast as the euro zoneaverage. Greece is still in recession while Portugal and Spainmanaged just a tenth of Germany's growth rate in Q2. (Reporting by Marc Jones; editing by Patrick Graham)             ]]></raw>
