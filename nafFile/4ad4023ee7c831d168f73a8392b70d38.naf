<raw><![CDATA[   * Israel budget deficit seen near 4 percent of GDP in 2010 * Unemployment rate seen under 6 percent by end 2011 * Intervention to weaken shekel a defensive measure * Finance Minister already sees evidence of "currency war" (Updates with added comment, background) By Daniel Bases NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Israeli Finance Minister YuvalSteinitz said on Tuesday the government's 2010 budget deficitwill be near 4 percent of gross domestic product, well belowthe 5.5 percent target as the economy rebounds from thefinancial crisis. "Until now we are meeting the target and doing even better.We finished 2009 with 5 percent rather than 6 percent, and in2010, because we did succeed to initiate rapid or speedyrecovery, it will be more like 4 percent instead of the ceilinglike 5.5 percent," Steinitz told Reuters in an interview. Steinitz, in New York to speak with investors beforeheading to Washington for meetings of the InternationalMonetary Fund and World Bank, said he would not predict thedeficit for 2011 or 2012. "We will meet the ceiling," he said referring to the 3percent budget deficit forecast for 2011 and 2 percent in2012. Growth was an annualized 4.6 percent in the second quarter,while the jobless rate slipped to 6.2 percent. For all of 2010the economy is expected to grow 4.1 percent. Steinitz said the unemployment rate can continue to dropand has the potential to break through an historical floor. "We do believe that maybe for the first time in Israelihistory we will be able to reduce unemployment toward the endof 2011 beyond 6 percent, 5-point-something percent," Steinitzsaid. CURRENCY TUSSLE Steinitz tried to deflect attention away from frictionbetween the Finance Ministry and Bank of Israel GovernorStanley Fischer over the latter's action to weaken the shekel. The shekel  has advanced 6 percent against the U.S.dollar since late July, when the central bank resumed interestrate hikes after a short pause. The bank has been buying dollars in recent weeks to preventa rapid appreciation of the Israeli currency, since a strongshekel tends to hurt exports -- which account for more than 40percent of Israel's economy. Israel has been raising interest rates while much of thedeveloped world economies has been lowering them to try toignite growth and stave off deflation. Israel's key short-term lending rate  stands at2 percent. The BOI has justified the increases by citingcontinued gains in home costs and signs of higher wages. Asked if there is a policy dispute with Fischer, Steinitzsaid no. "Look, so far we completely agree on most issues. Generallyspeaking I think that we did have no choice, the Bank of Israeldid have not have a choice. We couldn't allow the shekel tobecome the strongest currency in the world because this wouldharm our exporting industries," he said. "It was defensive, it was reactive to other developments inthe world, in China and the rest of the world vis-a-vis China.Almost all governments were trying to weaken their currencies,also in Europe, Britain, Switzerland," Steinitz said. A big topic for discussion at the upcoming IMF/World Bankmeetings will likely be currencies, and beggar-thy-neighborpolicies as countries seek a firmer economic footing. "There is already evidence we are in a currency war,"Steinitz said. (Editing by James Dalgleish)             ]]></raw>
