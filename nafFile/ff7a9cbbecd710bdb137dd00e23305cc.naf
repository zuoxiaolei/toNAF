<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar falls from 3-1/2 month highs vs euro, basket * U.S. new home sales hit seven-month low in November * U.S. consumer sentiment rises but misses estimates * Canadian dollar hits more than 2-week high vs greenback (Updates prices, adds comment, details) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The dollar declined for thefirst time in five sessions against the euro on Wednesday afterU.S. new home sales unexpectedly fell to a seven-month low lastmonth, denting optimism about the economy. The government's housing report also included a downwardrevision to the previous month's figure, just one day after anindustry report showing a 7.4 percent increase in Novemberexisting home sales had increased hopes the hard-hit housingmarket was stabilizing. Trading was extremely thin, which may have exaggeratedcurrency moves; Tokyo markets were closed for a nationalholiday and many market players elsewhere have already wounddown for the Christmas holidays and year-end. "It's clearly a disappointing number," said NickBennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo in NewYork. "You're going to get bumps along the road every so oftenas far as recovery is concerned. It might change sentimentregarding interest rates and the dollar a little bit." Optimism about the U.S. economy had stoked expectations theFederal Reserve may raise its borrowing costs sooner ratherthan later, pushing the dollar to a 3-1/2-month high versus theeuro and a basket of six major currencies the previous day. Analysts said the dollar also dropped as investors soughtto lock in gains on the greenback's recent rise. "You've seen a big move in euro/dollar already. Folks aretaking some profits on their long dollar positions ahead of theholiday," said Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global FXstrategy at BNY Mellon in Boston. In midday trading, the euro was up 0.8 percent at $1.4357,rebounding from a 3-1/2-month low of $1.4216 on Tuesday after athird rating agency downgraded Greece's credit rating. Adding to pressure on the dollar was a survey showing thatalthough U.S. consumer sentiment rose in December, it fellshort of analyst expectations and trailed the preliminaryDecember figure. Against the yen, the dollar last dropped 0.5 percent to91.41 yen, after earlier climbing to 91.87 yen, its highestlevel since late October, according to Reuters data. CANADIAN DOLLAR RALLIES The ICE Futures dollar index, which values the greenbackagainst a basket of six currencies, fell 0.6 percent to 77.775,down from a 3-1/2-month peak of 78.449 hit on Tuesday. Sterling fell after minutes from the Bank of England'sDecember policy meeting showed that officials felt little hadchanged since November, which was seen as leaving the door opento a further expansion of the central bank's asset buyingprogram. "The minutes confirm that the committee is in wait-and-seemode until February, but don't close the door entirely onfurther policy action of some sort," said Jonathan Loynes,economist at Capital Economics. The pound fell as low as $1.5924, one tick from Tuesday'strough, which was the weakest level since mid-October. It waslast little changed at $1.5966. The Swiss franc rose against the euro to 1.4878. Tradersremained wary of possible action by the Swiss National Bank tocurb the franc's strength. The dollar fell 1.2 percent to1.0361 francs. The Canadian dollar hit a more than two-week high againstthe U.S. currency after Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flahertysaid in an interview with Bloomberg that China and Russia maydiversify their currency reserves into Canadian dollars. Thegreenback last dropped 1 percent to C$1.0471. (Additional reporting by Steven C. Johnson; Editing by LeslieAdler)             ]]></raw>
