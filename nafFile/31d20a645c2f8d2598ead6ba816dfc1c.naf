<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar rebounded against the yen on Wednesday, after posting the largest one day decline in more than three years against the Japanese currency on Tuesday.During European morning trade, the dollar recovered against the yen, with USD/JPY advancing 0.86% to 98.84.The dollar tumbled 2.7% against the yen on Tuesday following steep falls in Japanese equities after the Bank of Japan disappointed market expectations for measures to ease volatility in the government bond market.The BoJ’s lack of action along with growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will begin to unwind its USD85 billion-a-month asset purchase program this year fuelled fears that global central banks are coming to the end of stimulus programs.The dollar was at three-and-a-half month lows against the euro, with EUR/USD dipping 0.05% to 1.3303.The euro remained supported after Germany's Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble defended the European Central Bank’s bond purchasing scheme at a hearing in Germany’s constitutional court into the legality of the program on Tuesday.Elsewhere, the greenback was slightly lower against the pound, with GBP/USD easing up 0.10% to 1.5659, as trader’s awaited U.K. employment data later in the session.The dollar pushed higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF up 0.15% to 0.9259. The greenback was broadly lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts AUD/USD up 0.93% to 0.9512, NZD/USD adding 0.90% to trade at 0.7941 and USD/CAD slipping 0.11% to 1.0177.A report by Westpac Banking Corporation on Wednesday showed that Australian consumer sentiment rose 4.7% in June, after a 7% decline the previous month, but indicated that gains could be short lived as concerns over the economic outlook lingered.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.17% to 81.40.              ]]></raw>
