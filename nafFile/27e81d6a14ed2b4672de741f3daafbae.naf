<raw><![CDATA[ * European officials holding emergency meeting on Monday * Contagion risks increase; Italian yield spreads at recordhigh * Euro breaks trendline support, path open for furtherweakness By Neal Armstrong	 LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Monday,hurt by concern that the debt crisis is worsening as Europeanofficials gathered for an emergency meeting in Brussels, with aweakening technical outlook opening the way for further weaknessin the single currency. 	 The euro fell following news over the weekend that EuropeanCouncil President Herman Van Rompuy had called an emergencymeeting of top officials dealing with the euro zone crisis forMonday morning, amid concern that the problems could spread todebt-laden Italy.    	 A Financial Times report saying some EU leaders wereconsidering allowing a selective default by Athens, to put itsdebt on a more sustainable footing, also dented the singlecurrency, traders said.	 The euro took a hit on Friday when Italian bond yieldssoared to euro lifetime highs, raising fears that Italy, withthe highest sovereign debt ratio relative to its economy in theeuro zone after Greece, could be next to suffer. 	 The 10-year yield spread between Italian and German debtwidened further on Monday as concerns over contagion promptedinvestors to sell Italian paper in favor of safe-haven GermanBunds. 	 "Concerns over Italy show contagion risks in the euro zoneare increasing. Investor confidence remains  low and will limitdemand for euro-denominated assets," said Manuel Oliveri,currency analyst at UBS in Zurich. 	 In addition to Monday's emergency meeting, events to watchfor this week include the results of stress tests of Europeanbanks, which are due to be released on July 15. 	 The euro slid almost 1 percent to a two-week low of $1.4133 , with its technical picture becoming more negative as itfell below trendline support from its May lows at $1.4156.  	 "This trendline support is regarded as the break down pointto the 200-week moving average at $1.4024, the 1.3968 recent lowand the 200-day moving average at $1.3907," said technicalanalysts at Commerzbank in a note. 	 Traders said a large option barrier at $1.4130 may slowfurther falls in the euro in the near term. 	 The euro fell 0.8 percent against the Swiss franc to 1.1840francs , nearing a record low of 1.1808 hit in lateJune on trading platform EBS.	 Traders said further upside in the Swiss franc was likelyafter the chairman of the Swiss National Bank was quoted onSunday as saying there was no reason to curb the currency'sstrength at the moment as price stability was not yet underthreat. 	 The euro fell 0.7 percent against the yen to 114.15 yen .	  DOLLAR INDEX	 Worries over global growth added to demand for perceivedsafe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and the U.S.dollar, after a disappointing U.S. employment report and datashowing rising inflation in China spooked investors. 	 Data on Friday showed U.S. jobs growth nearly halted inJune, adding to concerns about the health of the world's biggesteconomy. 	  Data on Saturday showed annual inflation in Chinaaccelerated to a three-year high in June with the consumer priceindex up 6.4 percent from a year earlier, slightly above analystexpectations. 	 The dollar index rose 0.6 percent to 75.614, up fromFriday's low at 74.843. It faces resistance at its mid-June peakof 76.015.	  However the looming threat of a U.S. debt default may checkthe greenback's gains. President Barack Obama and congressionalleaders of both parties were in high-stakes talks to break theimpasse over raising the debt ceiling. 	  The dollar stood at 80.78 yen , up 0.2 percent fromlate U.S. trade on Friday, supported by bids from Japaneseimporters, but remained below Friday's five-week high around81.50 yen.  	 Global growth worries pulled commodity currencies lower as the Australian dollar fell 0.6 percent to $1.0694. TheNew Zealand dollar slipped 0.5 percent to $0.8328,pulling back from Friday's record high near $0.8400.
