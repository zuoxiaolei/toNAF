<raw><![CDATA[  * Intraday bias on dollar/yen turns higher * Demand for dollar/yen vols pick up * Sterling rises on rate hike expectations (Updates prices, adds correlation ratio, options trading) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The dollar climbed against theyen to its highest in eight weeks on Tuesday, boosted by therecent rise in U.S. Treasury yields, with more gains seenlikely if bond markets continue to factor in inflation. The greenback has gained against the yen in nine of thepast 10 sessions, rising more than 2 percent this month.Analysts at Action Forex said Tuesday's rise in the currencypair signified that the rebound from 80.93 yen, the Jan. 3 low,has resumed and intraday bias has shifted to the upside. Further rallies in dollar/yen should target the 84.51 yenresistance, the high on Dec. 15. On the downside, analysts saida break of Monday's 83.09 low is required to signal ashort-term peak. Otherwise, the outlook remains bullish, ActionForex said. Two-year Treasury yields have risen more than 20 basispoints since Feb. 1, while benchmark rates have edged up bymore than 17 basis points, seemingly driven by inflationexpectations amid an improving U.S. economy. That has increasedthe appeal of dollar assets, especially against anotherlow-yielding currency such as the yen. "The relationship between dollar/yen and U.S. yields hascome back into play," said Paresh Upadhyaya, head of AmericasG10 FX strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. Dollar/yen is the currency pair most sensitive to movementsin bond yields because both units are competing as the markets'favored funding unit. Any shift in the yield curve or rateexpectations should have an impact on both currencies. To see an analysis of market inflation expectationsdouble-click on [ID:nN15149987]. Upadhyaya said the correlation between two-year yields anddollar/yen broke down in December, but has come back in lateJanuary and February and has underpinned dollar/yen. On Tuesday, the correlation between dollar/yen andbenchmark 10-year yields were at a robust 70 percent, accordingto Reuters data. The return of that correlation, Upadhyaya noted, was partlyprecipitated by news from China on Tuesday showing new yuanloans, money supply and headline consumer prices were betterthan expected. [ID:nTOE71E06O] "That reduces expectations in the market that China mayhave to tighten more aggressively ... diminishing risk aversionand spurring some selling in the yen" as a a funder of riskassets, Upadhyaya said. In late afternoon trading, the dollar rose 0.6 percentversus the yen to 83.76, hitting an eight-week high at 83.93yen . Traders said there has been good interest to buy dollar/yenvolatility in the options market the past week as the front endof the curve, specifically three-month vols, which has recentlydeclined to its lowest in more than 3 years. That suggesteddollar/yen could see some movement in its price the next fewweeks, having been rangebound so far this year. Three-month vols fell on Tuesday to 10.00 percent after posting gains the last two days. At the same time, the euro outperformed the dollar for thefirst time in four days on Tuesday, bouncing from a three-weeklow. But the gains could be fleeting as technical factors pointto losses. The euro rose above $1.35 and traded off a 3-week low of$1.3428 on Monday. The euro  was last little changedagainst the dollar at $1.3488. Scotia Capital's chief currency strategist Camilla Suttonsaid near-term technicals are warning of the potential forfurther downside for the euro and suggest a test down to$1.3425 is likely. The euro faces obstacles from several directions, withsovereign debt risk and interest rate differentials workingdecidedly against the euro zone single currency. Europe moved closer on Tuesday to a deal on tackling itsdebt crisis, but time is tight to agree on a comprehensivepackage by the end of March and officials announced extrameetings to boost chances of reaching an accord.[ID:nLDE71E289] Sterling  rallied 0.6 percent against the dollar to$1.6128 after data showed for the thirteenth consecutive monththe UK's inflation rate is above the upper target of the Bankof England. This fueled speculation rates will rise in the nearterm as the BoE seeks to contain price pressures. (Additional reporting by Julie Haviv; Editing by JamesDalgleish)             ]]></raw>
