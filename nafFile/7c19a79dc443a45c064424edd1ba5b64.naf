<raw><![CDATA[ * Repsol Q3 net, operating profit halved * Q3 EBIT, net profit beat forecasts * To reduce initial estimate of 5.5 bln eur capex for 2010 * Shares close slightly higher  (Adds coments on capex, dividend from conference call)  By Jonathan Gleave MADRID, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Spain's Repsol is targeting stillmore cost cuts in 2010, including in its 5.5 billion euros($8.25 billion) capex budget, the oil group said on Thursdayafter quarterly earnings beat forecasts. The company moved to cut costs sharply in 2009 after weakrefining margins and gas prices ate into profits, and byend-September it had saved about 611 million euros, although itscash position remained negative. "I haven't reviewed the budget for 2010 but the initialfigure is 5.5 billion euros... I have to shave this a little,"the oil major's chief operating officer, Miguel Martinez, toldanalysts on a conference call after the results. "We were 600-700 million euros short in cash at endSeptember," Martinez added. Repsol said in February that it planned to save 1.5 billioneuros over the course of 2009. Martinez declined to comment on recent reports that Repsolmight cut its dividend but did say, in his opinion, a decisionon the 2009 interim dividend would come in November. Repsol Chairman Antonio Brufau suggested talking aboutreducing the company's dividend at a recent board meeting.  THIRD QUARTER ABOVE CONSENSUS Third-quarter net profit at the oil major declined to 279million euros ($418.4 million), down more than half from lastyear but beating forecasts, as did operating profit."Operating profit was about 100 million euros higher than ourforecasts, thanks to a slightly better than expected performance(at) Repsol's core Argentine, Upstream and downstream units,"Intermoney analyst Alvaro Navarro said. Analysts said higher oil production, a better performance atthe group's Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) and marketing units, andbetter prices at its Argentine unit had all underpinned theresults. Adjusted constant cost of supply (CCS) earnings beforeinterest and taxes (EBIT) reached 759 million euros ($1.14billion), beating forecasts for 652 million from a Reuters pollof ten analysts. Net debt increased 170 million euros in the third quarterfrom the second to 10.57 billion euros. Repsol shares closed up 0.16 percent at 18.85 euros,outperforming European peers, which lost 0.51 percent.
