<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The New Zealand dollar edged higher against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, but gains were capped by rumours in Germany and as concerns over U.S. debt talks continued to weigh. NZD/USD hit 0.8424 during late Asian trade, the daily high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.8420, adding 0.14%. The pair was likely to find support at 0.8360, the low of January 14 and resistance at 0.8460, the high of January 10.  Investors remained cautious amid rumors some large German banks could be asked to split their investment banking operations. Markets were also eyeing U.S. budget negotiations after Republican leaders in the House of Representatives said they aim to pass on Wednesday a nearly four-month extension of the U.S. debt limit allowing the government to borrow enough to meet its obligations during that period.  Elsewhere, the kiwi was higher against the Australian dollar with AUD/NZD slipping 0.25%, to hit 1.2532.  Also Wednesday, official data showed that consumer price inflation in Australia rose less-than-expected in the fourth quarter, ticking up 0.2% after a 1.4% rise in the previous quarter. Analysts had expected consumer price inflation to rise 0.4% in the last quarter. Later in the day, the U.S. was to release government data on crude oil stockpiles, while the World Economic Forum was to continue for a second day in Davos, Switzerland.             ]]></raw>
