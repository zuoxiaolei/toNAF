<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The New Zealand dollar declined against its U.S. counterpart on Friday, falling to three-week low as risk aversion sharpened amid fears that the euro zone’s sovereign debt crisis is worsening. NZD/USD hit 0.8190 on Friday, the lowest since August 22; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.8217 by close of trade on Friday, tumbling 2.67% on the week.  The pair was likely to find short-term support at 0.8157, the low of August 22 and resistance at 0.8381, Thursday’s high.
