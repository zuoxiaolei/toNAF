Also on Thursday, the Department of Labor reported that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless claims in the U.S. rose by 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 309,000 in the week ending Sept. 14, from an upwardly revised 294,000 the previous week. Analysts were expecting the number to rise by 36,000 to 330,000 last week. Elsewhere, the U.S. current account deficit narrowed to USD98.9 billion in the second quarter, from an downwardly revised deficit of USD104.9 billion in the three months to March.
