<raw><![CDATA[Yen holds gains after GDPInvesting.com - The yen held gains in Asia on Tuesday as investors noted Japan GDP did not fall as much as expected, shrugging off a narrower than expected current account surplus.USD/JPY changed hands at 113.30, down 0.13%, while AUD/USD traded at 0.7459, down 0.12%.In Japan, a busy data day sees the current account for January come in at an unadjusted surplus of ¥521 billion, narrower than the surplus of ¥719 billion seenAs well, fourth quarter GDP dropped 0.3%, less than the fall of 0.4% quarter-on-quarter seen and down 1.1% year-on-year, less than the 1.5% drop expected.Later in Australia, the NAB business confidence survey for February is due with the previous reading at plus-2, along with the NAB business survey which last came in at plus-5.Earlier, comments from Australia moved the currency slightly down.Weak wage growth means less pressure on inflation and likely accommodative monetary policy, Reserve Bank of Australia Deputy Governor Philip Lowe said Tuesday."It is possible that wage outcomes will remain very subdued even in countries with strong labor markets. If this turns out to be the case then it is likely that inflation rates will also continue to be very low and monetary policy very accommodative," he said.In China, trade data is expected to show exports fell 12.5% in February year-on-year and imports declined 10% for a trade balance surplus of $50.15 billion.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was last quoted at 97.12, down 0.13%.Overnight, the dollar trimmed gains against the other major currencies on Monday, as Friday’s employment data still lent some support, although lower expectations for a U.S. rate hike in the near future limited gains.The U.S. economy added 242,000 new jobs last month and the unemployment rate held steady at an eight-year low of 4.9%.But average hourly earnings fell by 0.1% during February, reversing the 0.5% rise seen in January.The weak wage numbers indicated that consumer inflation is likely to remain muted. Federal Reserve policymakers are watching inflation closely as they try to determine when to raise rates again.Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda underlined the positive aspects of the negative interest rate policy adopted by the BoJ in January and which took effect on February 16.The policy “works in the direction of raising stock prices and lowering the value of the yen,” Kuroda said during a speech in Tokyo.             ]]></raw>
