<raw><![CDATA[  * Swiss franc up on safe-haven bid on Middle East tension  * Dollar under pressure as geopolitical concerns weigh * U.S. inflation, jobless claims data higher than expected * Spain sells debt, but banking worries remain (Recasts, updates prices, adds quotes; changes datelineprevious London, byline) By Julie Haviv New York, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc ralliedsharply against rival currencies on Thursday as Middle Easttensions lifted its safe-haven appeal, but the euro gainedafter solid Spanish debt auction. Unrest in Yemen and Bahrain and concern about Iranianwarships using the Suez Canal have fostered uncertainty amonginvestors. The Swiss franc is traditionally sought as a safe-havenduring times of geopolitical tensions. If events in the MiddleEast escalate safe haven flows should further buoy the Swissfranc. Against the Swiss franc, the euro was down 0.6 percent at1.2936 francs, while the dollar was down 0.8 percent at 0.9520francs. Key technical support for the Euro/Swiss franc was brokenat 1.3005, the 21-day moving average and base of the Bollingerband. Technicians target 1.2815 as the next bear objective andsee 1.2896 as support. This is the 38.2 percent retracement of the rally from1.2398 record lows to the 1.3205 high from last Friday. Strongsupport should emerge around this region, an analyst said. Euro/Swiss franc one-month volatilities fell on Thursday,although risk reversals continued to move in favor of Swissfranc calls, with the one-month 25-delta around 1.40 comparedto a neutral bias at the start of the year. Meanwhile, U.S. inflation and weekly claims for joblessbenefits came in higher than expected. Michael Woolfolk, managing director at BNY Mellon GlobalMarkets in New York, said inflation is not strictly an overseasphenomenon. "Today's slate of Fed speakers will have ample opportunityto comment on their views of emerging inflationary risks," hesaid. "Higher rate expectations will prove dollar positive onlyto the extent they rise faster than European rateexpectations." The Federal Reserve has justified its decision to keepinterest rates at record lows by pointing to high unemploymentand excessively low inflation. U.S. Treasury prices extended gains after the inflationdata.. Federal funds futures for January 2012 delivery toucheda session high. The euro was last up 0.3 percent at $1.3606 dollars. George Davis, senior currency strategist at RBC CapitalMarkets in Toronto, said a short-term resistance comes in at$1.3615. "That's the most relevant level on the topside and if weclose above it, the euro has the potential to extend toward$1.3745," he said. "On the downside, $1.3484 is trend linesupport, and at a minimum, we would have to take that out tocause an acceleration." The dollar fell against the yen for a second straight dayand was last at 83.26 yen, down 0.5 percent. Spain and France sold a combined 11.87 billion euros ofdebt at auctions which analysts said fared well, with alonger-dated Spanish bond notably attracting good bids as itlooked cheap on the Spanish curve. The Spanish auction helped pull the euro off a session lowversus the dollar, though the fragility of the euro zonebanking sector was highlighted by a jump in emergency overnightborrowing at the European Central Bank. "The Spanish government sold the debt, but there areconcerns about the increased overnight borrowing at the ECB,"said Gavin Friend at nabCapital. The euro and other major currencies remained trapped inranges. Expectations that spot prices will not move too far inone direction or the other pushed euro/dollar impliedvolatility to 10.7 percent its lowest level since September.
