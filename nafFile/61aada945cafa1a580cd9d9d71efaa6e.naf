<raw><![CDATA[ * Austerity not seen as political suicide * Fed, ECB should keep rates low until 2012 * Capital flows fuelling currency tensions  By Leigh Thomas PARIS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Governments risk unleashing aprotectionist backlash if they act alone to address currencyimbalances, and cooperation among the Group of 20 countries iskey if the global economy is to stabilise, the OECD said onThursday. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment said the G20 leading economies must play anessential role as governments began the delicate task of windingdown exceptional measures that propped up their economies afterthe global financial crisis. In its twice-yearly Economic Outlook, the OECD said its 33wealthy, industrialised member governments should begintightening fiscal policy in the course of next year, unless theeconomy takes an unexpected turn for the worse. "Austerity measures are not at all political suicideespecially if they are well explained," OECD chief economistPier Carlo Padoan told Reuters in an interview. He said clearly spelling out fiscal plans and timetableswould inspire confidence from companies, and that voters wouldbe understanding of budget tightening if the burden was broadlyshared.  "Governments have exhausted their short-term measures, sothey need to provide a credible long-term policy framework,"Padoan said.  MONETARY POLICY LOGJAM The OECD forecast in its Economic Outlook that world growthwill shift down a gear next year as the United States reboundsless quickly than expected and growth in emerging countriesmoderate. With governments' budgets strained, Padoan said that theonly major short-term measure still available for economicstimulus was quantitative easing by central banks. "Quantitative easing can work although we feel its impactwill have (a) decreasing return going forward," he said. He described the U.S. Federal Reserve's plans to buy $600billion dollars in government bonds as appropriate in theabsence of inflationary risk, and recommended that Japanconsider more quantitative easing. The OECD said the Federal Reserve should hold off on raisinginterest rates until the recovery is firmly entrenched in themiddle of 2012 -- later than the market consensus. It said Japan should wait until inflation is clearlypositive before considering higher interest rates, which wouldlikely be beyond 2012. The OECD said the European Central Bank should not raiseinterest rates before 2012 and that the Bank of England keep itscurrent policy stance until the middle of 2011. With developed economies awash with liquidity thanks torock-bottom interest rates, capital is flooding into fastergrowing developing countries with higher rates of return,driving up their currencies. In an editorial in the OECD Outlook, Padoan said unilateralaction to soften the impact of currency appreciation could becounterproductive and "risks triggering protectionist moves." However, he said unilateral actions to contain a risingcurrency reflected dissatisfaction with attempts to address theproblem with an international cooperative response.
