<raw><![CDATA[ * Government may be unable to stop appreciation of real * Recent intervention efforts carry heavy fiscal cost * Markets betting that currency will remain overvalued (Repeats for additional subscribers) By Samantha Pearson SAO PAULO, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Brazil is locked in a bitterstruggle with investors over the value of its currency -- abattle it is unlikely to win without major casualties. The government is increasingly desperate to halt theappreciation of the real , which has more than doubled invalue against the dollar since President Luiz Inacio Lula daSilva took office in 2003 and is now, by one measure, theworld's most overvalued major currency. The currency's rise is in part a reflection of Lula'ssuccess in transforming Brazil into a darling of foreigninvestors. Yet what was once seen as a blessing has become acurse, and Finance Minister Guido Mantega warned Thursday thatthe government will take whatever measures are necessary tokeep the real from further damaging exporters. [ID:nN09214757] Meanwhile, the central bank has resorted to unusual,multiple interventions in the market this week to try to keepthe real at or above its current level of 1.72 per dollar, nearits strongest level this year.   Graphic on Brazil's real: http://link.reuters.com/xuv52p Yet Brazil's government and monetary authority may verywell be outgunned in the near-term by a host of economicfundamentals and one-off events, namely the $65 billion shareoffering planned by state oil company Petrobras later thismonth. Analysts say that could unleash further deals and yetanother wave of foreign investment inflows. Continuing to fight the real's appreciation also carriespotential fiscal costs that may prove too much to bear at atime when the government is already ramping up spending aheadof presidential elections on Oct. 3. In fact, markets are increasingly betting that thegovernment will blink. Wagers by foreign investors on astronger real reached $14.1 billion as of Sep. 3, according toBrazil's Banco Safra -- not far below an all-time high. "While most central banks carry a certain clout, marketshave a tendency to become a groundswell of opinion backed byreal positions, with real risk on the line," says AndrewWilkinson at Interactive Brokers. BRAZIL: A VICTIM OF ITS OWN SUCCESS Brazil's combination of robust 7 percent annual economicgrowth and some of the world's highest interest rates -- thebenchmark rate is at 10.75 percent -- has made it anirresistible target for foreign investors at a time when mostof the world is dominated by low yields and weak growth. The global growth hunt has also pushed Peru's currency close to an all-time high and boosted the Chilean peso to its strongest level in eight months. But the real is the most overvalued of all the world'smajor 33 currencies, according to Goldman Sachs. Against theU.S. dollar, the real is overvalued by a whopping 53 percent,it says. Even the threat of a double-dip recession in the UnitedStates seems to have had little effect on the real in recentweeks, says Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at BNYMellon in New York. "The Brazilian real is hanging in there -- it's very tough,very strong. It seems to be trading off its own fundamentalsrather than international investor risk appetite or theperformance of the U.S. economy," he says.  While the central bank insists that it is not trying tofix Brazil's currency at a particular level, economists pointto 1.70 real-per-dollar as the government's breaking point. The central bank doubled its dollar purchases on the spotmarket last month, buying $3.04 billion, its biggest monthlypurchase so far this year. On Wednesday, the bank took theunusual step of calling two, rather than one, auctions -- thefirst time that had happened since May. The bank did the same thing on Thursday. Yet, in a potentially foreboding sign, investors havebarely flinched. The real closed stronger on the local spotmarket on both Wednesday and Thursday. The interventions also carry a heavy cost, adding toBrazil's growing debt burden. Most of the dollars the bank buysare held in reserve in U.S. Treasuries, which are currentlyyielding next to nothing. Meanwhile, the bank still has to payout much higher interest rates in reais. MIXED RECORD OF INTERVENTION Brazil doesn't have to look too far into its own past tosee that currency interventions often don't work out. Lula's predecessor as president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso,spent billions of dollars trying to maintain the real's valuewhen it was loosely pegged to the dollar in the late 1990s. Thepeg ultimately buckled, causing a traumatic devaluation. Other countries such as China have got intervention down toa fine art, keeping the currency exactly where they want it. If the real continues to appreciate, Brazilian authoritiescould resort to weapons of mass destruction such as raising a 2percent tax on foreign purchases of bonds and stocks that wasimposed last October during another bout of currency strength. That would help to reduce foreign capital inflows. But itcould also scare away the same investment that is helping toplug the country's gaping current account deficit, whichreached a monthly record in July and is a source of growingconcern. [ID:nN23194162] Another option would be for the central bank to employso-called "reverse swaps", a form of derivative that would havethe same effect as buying dollars in the futures market.However, a previous period of swaps between 2005 and 2008failed to stem a significant appreciation of the real. The mere threat of such measures has been enough to makesome investors wary. PETROBRAS IMPACT Diego Donadio, an analyst at BNP Paribas in Sao Paulo, saysthe possibility of greater intervention is the main reason thathe is now advising his clients to buy other currencies insteadof the real, such as the Mexican peso. "There are so many deals in the pipeline, whether they bebonds or acquisitions and the capitalization of Petrobras. Buton the other hand the risk from intervention is very high," hesays.  Although many questions remain unanswered about themechanics of the Petrobras  capitalization, traders expect the deal to lure between $15billion and $25 billion of foreign investment to Brazil. Since other local companies have been afraid to come tomarket in recent months, for fear of being upstaged by the oilgiant, a deluge of smaller deals could also follow. Flavia Cattan-Naslausky, a strategist at RBS Securities isamong those who believe the central bank may choose tosurrender somewhat to the currency's rally during this period. Recent comments from Mantega show "some resignation toshort-term appreciation around these large corporate deals,"she says.
