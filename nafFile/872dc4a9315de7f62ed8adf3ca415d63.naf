<raw><![CDATA[ * Wall Street slides 1.7 pct, led by bank shares * Euro sags to 2-1/2-week low on wrangling over Greek aid * U.S. oil falls 4 pct to lowest level since February * U.S. Treasuries poised for biggest rally in 9 months (Updates with late market action) By Richard Leong NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euroslumped on Wednesday as upheaval in highly indebted Greece andindecision among Europe's leaders about helping the nation fedfears the euro zone member is edging closer to default. The euro tumbled 2 percent against the dollar andgovernment debt of the United States and Germany rallied on asafety bid after euro zone finance ministers failed to agree onhow to involve private investors in a second financial rescuefor Greece. Senior EU officials said a deal was now unlikely to bereached at a summit next week and was likely to be delayeduntil mid-July. "It had looked like we were making progress on addressingGreece's problems but now it seems things are fraying at theedges. People are capitulating, taking a defensive posture andgetting out of their risky trades." said George Davis, seniorcurrency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. The dollar's strengthening against the euro helped propel amore than 4 percent slide in the price of U.S. crude oil, hurtalso by further signs of economic weakness. In the United States, dismal manufacturing and housing dataintensified fears of slowing growth. "There are plenty of things you can pick to be worriedabout," said John Wilson, chief equity strategist at MorganKeegan at Chattanooga, Tennessee. "You are seeing acapitulation and market sentiment is getting more negative." Investors recoiled at the latest developments less than 24hours after they had tip-toed back into stocks and other riskyassets. Wednesday's flight out of growth-driven investmentspushed the euro and U.S. stock indexes down near key technicalsupport levels. Bank shares led the global sell-off after Moody's InvestorsService said it may put the credit ratings of French banks BNPParibas , Credit Agricole and SocieteGenerale  on review for a possible downgrade, citingthe banks' holdings of Greek public and private debt. The rating agency later placed the ratings of some units ofPortuguese banks in Brazil on review for possible downgrade. The MSCI world stock index  sagged 1.9percent a day after posting its biggest single-day percentagerise in two weeks due to less-grim economic data from China andthe United States. On Wall Street, stocks erased Tuesday's gains, which hadtemporarily slowed a six-week sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average  closed down 178.84points, or 1.48 percent, at 11,897.27. The Standard & Poor's500 Index  ended down 22.45 points, or 1.74 percent, at1,265.42. The Nasdaq Composite Index  finished down47.26 points, or 1.76 percent, at 2,631.46. Top European shares  lost 1.1 percent on the day,while Tokyo's Nikkei  ended 0.3 percent lower followingTuesday's rally in New York. STOCKS VULNERABLE As more evidence of an economic slowdown is likely toemerge, some analysts see a further decline in stocks. "Even if it's in a soft patch, the slope of the U.S.recovery will still be disappointing and it will be an unevenperformance," said Clark Yingst, chief market analyst at JosephGunnar in New York. The expiration of the Federal Reserve's $600 billion bondprogram, known as QE2, at month's-end and disappointingquarterly company results could put additional selling pressureon stocks in the near term, Yingst said. He forecasts the S&P 500 could fall 11-20 percent from itspeak in early May. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of protesters in Greece ragedagainst a new wave of austerity after euro zone financeministers failed to agree how to make private creditorscontribute to a second bailout. Greece is seeking 120 billioneuros in fresh aid. The onus has now shifted to the leaders of Germany andFrance to forge a deal later this week. Prime Minister George Papandreou offered to quit and makeway for a national unity government.

"Greece can't continue along its currentpath, we all know that. The question is, 'What is theresolution?'" The latest twists in Greece's predicament, combined withMoody's warning on French banks, knocked the euro lower. The single-currency  fell 2 percent against thedollar to $1.4178, for its worst day in more than a month. Investor jitters rekindled a flight into low-risk U.S. andGerman government bonds. The stampede into bonds knocked benchmark 10-year Treasuryyields  back below 3 percent, putting them on trackfor their biggest one-day drop since September. The 10-yearU.S. yield touched a two-week high on Tuesday. German Bund futures  ended up 0.7 percent near acontract high set earlier at 126.35. Safety bids also lifted gold prices. Spot bullion was lastat $1,530.50 an ounce, up from $1,523.25 on Tuesday. Increased risk aversion wiped out earlier gains in oil.U.S. oil prices  fell $4.59 to settle at $94.81 a barrelafter rising earlier on government data showing an unexpectedlylarge 3.41-million-barrel drop in crude inventory.
