<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar drops through 83.50 yen to latest 15-year low * Euro flounders near record trough on Swiss franc * Market testing water for next trend move By Charlotte Cooper TOKYO, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The dollar dropped to its latest15-year low on the yen on Wednesday and the euro struggled nearrecord lows against the Swiss franc as the market weighed whetherto sell it further on euro zone banking worries. The market is trying to ascertain how risk-averse it shouldbe after a report reignited concerns about European sovereigndebt and banks' exposure on Tuesday, sending stocks down andlifting the low-yielding, safe-haven yen, franc and dollar. The move has also helped the yen against the dollar, whichfell to its lowest since 1995 as traders probed for optionsbarriers at 83.50 and tested Japanese authorities' pain thresholdfor currency strength. The dollar dipped as far as 83.34 yen,down 0.5 percent on the day. "The euro looks precarious again. The dollar will be weakahead of the mid-term election. That leaves the yen as the onlycurrency to buy especially after (Bank of Japan Governor)Shirakawa made only vague comments about the yen," a U.S. banktrader said. BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa reiterated on Wednesday hisreluctance to return to quantitative easing but indicated thecentral bank was weighing its options on how to deal witheconomic impact from yen strength. The euro also fell 0.5 percent to 105.83 yen and wasthreatening to revisit August's nine-year low just below 105.50. Yen strength has stirred up speculation whether Japan wouldintervene to dampen it. Michael Hasenstab, Franklin Templeton's co-director ofinternational bonds, said more quantitative easing steps by Japanwere possible and could weaken the yen, and this promptedTempleton to hold on to short yen positions versus the dollardollar and other Asian currencies. "The only source of strength in the Japanese economy isexports. And with the yen sub 90 (per dollar), they will be underextreme pressure," Hasenstab told the Reuters' Dealing Roomonline chatroom. The euro was pinned at $1.2690, having dived from $1.2870 onTuesday and a three-week high of $1.2920 the day before. Tradersare now looking for a test of support around $1.2625, though theyare not exactly keen to go long onthe U.S. currency either. "It's the same old ugly contest -- which currency is theleast unattractive," said a dealer at a local bank in Sydney. The euro eased slightly on the day to 1.2820 francs, justabove the previous day's record low of 1.2812 francs, and traderssaw little chart support until 1.2700. The euro held near a record low on the Australian dollar seton Tuesday below A$1.3900.
