<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded lower against its major counterparts on Thursday, as stronger than expected German business confidence figures fuelled euro zone confidence.. During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD rising 0.89% to hit 1.3368. The euro strengthened  after German research institute Ifo said its Business Climate Index rose to109.6 in February from a reading of 108.3 the previous month, surpassing expectations for an increase to 108.8, fuelling hopes that the euro zone’s largest economy is weathering the impact of the debt crisis in the region.However,  the European Commission changed its November economic growth forecast for 0.05% growth to a 0.3% contraction in the euro zone. The EU expects the economy to shrink 1.3% in Italy and give back 1% in Spain. Trying to ease the worry, European Union Economic and Monetary Commissioner, Olli Rehn stated, “Although growth has stalled, we are seeing signs of stabilization in the European economy. Economic sentiment is still at low levels, but stress in financial markets is easing.”In Greek news, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated she will keep the pressure on Greece to meet its debt cutting pledge as many remain skeptical of Greek’s true intentions. The greenback was also lower against the pound, with GBP/USD adding 0.42% to hit 1.5736. The pound found support after the Confederation of British Industry reported  that U.K. factory orders rebounded to hit a six-month high in February, rising by 13 points to minus 3.0, from a reading of minus 16 in January. The greenback was lower against yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY falling 0.36% to hit 80.00 and USD/CHF giving back 0.91% to hit 0.9980. Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said earlier that he wants to have one-on-one talks with the Bank of Japan governor more frequently and to boost cooperation with the central bank. The comments came after the BoJ’s decision last week to increase the size of its asset-purchase program to JPY30 trillion, sending the yen broadly lower. In addition, the greenback was lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD retreating 0.0019% to hit 0.9979,AUD/USD climbing 0.64% to hit 1.0705 and NZD/USD advancing 0.58% to hit 0.8339. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.72% to hit 78.73. In the U.S., a report by the Department of Labor showed that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending February 18 held steady at 351,000, missing expectations for an increase of 3,000 to 354,000.  Jobless claims have remained below 400,000, a level historically associated with an improving labor market, in 15 of the past 17 weeks.              ]]></raw>
