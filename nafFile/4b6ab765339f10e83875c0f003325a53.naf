<raw><![CDATA[ * China trade official says not to change pro-export policies * Vice trade minister says will decide yuan on domestic needs  (Add quotes, details) BEIJING, April 2 (Reuters) - China will not abandon policiesdesigned to promote exports but will increase imports andstockpiles of strategic resources, Vice-Commerce Minister ChenJian told a forum on Friday. "China will not change its pro-export policies," he said. Asked about whether China will change policy on the yuan, Chen said: "China will make yuan decisions in aresponsible manner according to our own economic situation." He said China's yuan should not be blamed for globalimbalance. "It is not appropriate to talk too much about the exchangerate issue," he said. Chen made the comments when tensions between Washington andBeijing over the yuan issue are likely to ease. [ID:nSGE63100G] Chen's ministry has expressed concerns that any yuan rise maygive Chinese exporters a heavy blow as most exporters operate onthin profit margins and do not have enough tools to hedgecurrency risks. China's "stress test" in its labour-intensive export sectorsfound that yuan appreciation would seriously reduce exporters'profits, the Economic Information Daily reported. Chen said the yuan stress test did not mean Beijing was readyto make any policy changes. He added that China was likely to book its first tradedeficit in March since April 2004 due to a surge in imports. As for the retreat of Google Inc  from China and theconviction of four Rio Tinto  employees, Chen saidthe two cases will not change China's investment environment forforeign investors.
