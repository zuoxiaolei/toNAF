<raw><![CDATA[ * Ruling socialists lead Conservatives by 10 pct points * Some 60 percent believe Greece will get over crisis * Nearly half back strikes against austerity measures  (Adds details, context) ATHENS, April 3 (Reuters) - Greece's ruling socialistscontinue to lead their main opposition conservative rivalsdespite having taken tough austerity measures to deal with thecountry's debt crisis, an opinion poll showed on Saturday. The poll conducted by pollsters Alco for newspaper ProtoThema showed the ruling PASOK socialists leading theConservatives by 10 percentage points -- 32.1 to 22.1 percent. The ratings for both parties were lower than from a JanuaryAlco poll that showed PASOK with 34.7 percent support and theconservatives 25.5. Under pressure from its euro zone partners and risingborrowing costs, the Socialist-led government has cut publicsectors wages, frozen pension and raised taxed, aiming atcutting the budget deficit by 4 percentage points to 8.7 percentof GDP this year. Euro zone leaders and the IMF have supported the steps andsay they should prevent a deepening of the crisis, but investorsare keeping a close eye on public opinion because they are stillunsure whether the government will be able to carry them out. Saturday's poll also showed that about half of the 1,000respondents were in favour of labour strikes against thebelt-tightening, while 42 percent were not. Some 60 percentbelieved Greece would finally get over its financial crisis. A different poll published on Friday showed PASOK with asimilar lead, but also showed three quarters of Greeks thoughtthat the government's plan to cut the country's budget deficitwas "socially unfair" because it was aimed at lower earners.
