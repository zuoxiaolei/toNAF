<raw><![CDATA[ * Stocks decline as dollar reverses course * Euro slips on renewed regional debt concern * Gold hits high, then levels off (Updates with U.S. markets' opening) By Al Yoon NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Stocks fell on Monday asrenewed concerns about heavy European debts boosted the dollar,hurting commodities and tempering the outlook for equitiesafter a two-month rally. World stocks as measured by MSCI  fell 0.4percent after rising last week to levels last reached prior tothe collapse of Lehman Brothers. On Wall Street, stocks maintained an inverse relationshipwith the dollar, which had slumped to a 9-1/2 month low againstthe euro on expectations the Federal Reserve would buy moreU.S. debt and fuel inflation. Worry about extensive Fed easingwas tempered on Friday by a strong U.S. jobs report forOctober. Some of the euro's fall against the dollar reflectedrenewed concern about some euro zone peripheral economies. Newspaper reports raising fresh doubts about Ireland'sability to fund itself internationally have weighed on the euroand caused spreads between Irish and German government bondyields to widen. "We're finally seeing the market turn its gaze away fromFed easing and toward these ongoing problems in peripheralEurope," said Matthew Strauss, senior strategist at RBC CapitalMarkets in Toronto. "Even before the Fed meeting, spreads for Ireland, Greece,Portugal were widening, and now that the Fed has indicated whatit will do, the market is starting to trade on these worries." The Dow Jones industrial average  fell 58.05 points,or 0.51 percent, to 11,386.03. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  declined 5.10 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,220.75 andthe Nasdaq Composite Index  slipped 0.66 points to2,578.32. Financial stocks were among the biggest losers. The S&Pfinancial index  declined 0.7 percent, weighed down by a1.5 percent decline in shares of Wells Fargo & Co  and a1.9 percent drop in State Street Corp . The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European sharesdeclined 0.1 percent as investors cashed in on six-month highprices reached on Friday. "Some degree of profit-taking doesn't come as a surpriseafter a gain of about 15 percent since late August. The marketmight lack a little bit of direction for the first day or twoof the week," said Keith Bowman, analyst at HargreavesLansdown. Metals prices slipped as the dollar rose, while oil futures  fell 0.6 percent toward $86 a barrel, easing fromtwo-year highs earlier in the session. Gold  slipped forthe first time in three sessions -- falling $1.20 to $1,392.20-- but remained near its record high of $1398.35 hit earlier inthe day. Shares of Alcoa Inc , the largest U.S. aluminumproducer, fell 1.1 percent to $13.85, while Exxon Mobil Corp dipped 0.3 percent to $69.76. The dollar has been weakening as a result of the Fed'spledge to purchase $600 billion in U.S. Treasury securities, aform of money-printing stimulus known as quantitative easing. On Monday, however, the U.S. currency was up 0.69 percentagainst major currencies , recouping recent lossesfollowing the stronger-than-expected U.S jobs data. The euro was notably weak, down 0.9 percent at $1.3908. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down0.09 percent at 81.18 yen. Government debt was mixed, with benchmark 10-year U.S.Treasury yields falling 0.02 percentage point to 2.52 percent.Shorter-term yields edged higher ahead of the Treasury's $32billion three-year note auction.
