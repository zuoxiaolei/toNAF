<raw><![CDATA[ * Stocks fall 0.7 pct on Mideast tensions, high oil prices	 * Markets fret about longer term impact on growth	 * P/E indicators show MSCI APXJ fairly valued 	 * U.S. Treasuries, precious metals gain	  By Saikat Chatterjee	 HONG KONG, March 7 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices rose to2-1/2 year highs on Monday on heightened worries about supplydisruption due to deepening unrest in Libya, while Asian stocksslipped as concerns about the Middle East and higher energyprices weighed on equities.	 Asian markets have see-sawed following volatile oil pricesin recent weeks, but the MSCI ex-Japan index isbarely a percent away from a 2-1/2 year peak tested in January,indicating markets have been largely resilient to the Libyancrisis.	 Still, investors are worried that a prolonged period of highoil prices could stifle economic growth and erode corporateprofits, while adding to inflationary pressures in emergingeconomies.	 On Monday, the MSCI ex-Japan index was down more than half apercent.	 U.S. crude oil futures jumped 1.6 percent, topping$106, to the highest price in 2-1/2 years on Monday as acounter-offensive by Libya's Muammar Gaddafi against rebelsdeepened concerns that a civil war is brewing in Africa'slargest holder of oil reserves. 	 ICE Brent crude for April was trading at $117.28 abarrel, up 1.1 percent.	 "The concern is that with what we are seeing in Libya, it'spurely fear driving the market," said Jonathan Barratt, managingdirector at Commodity Broking Services in Sydney.	 "Each time the price moves up a little, people are forcedinto the market. Once it's feeding itself, it will continue torise," Barratt said, adding $120 may be the peak without furthersupply disruptions.	    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Oil price shocks               http://r.reuters.com/qes28r Middle East unrest             http://r.reuters.com/nym77r For a graphic of equities' correlation to oil, see:                              http://r.reuters.com/mut38r     A SNAP ANALYSIS ON U.S. jobs data:              For a graphic on gold prices:  http://r.reuters.com/baw38r^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	 A reasonably strong batch of U.S. data on Friday that showedthe jobless rate falling to a near two-year low failed to boostsentiment, as investors remained firmly focused on thedevelopments in the Middle East and the resulting longer-termimpact on oil. .	 U.S. crude is up by more than a fifth in the last two weeks.	 The spike in oil combined with soaring food prices presentfresh problems for central banks in Thailand, Malaysia, SouthKorea and New Zealand who head for policy meetings this week.	 The region is a big importer of oil and market players areworried that sharp increases in prices would stifle growth andfuel inflationary pressures.	  FAIRLY VALUED?	 The MSCI APXJ index is trading at 12.7 times forward12-month earnings, at par with its long-term average, I/B/E/Sdata showed -- indicating that markets are now fairly valued.	 "Higher oil prices are a key factor weighing on investorsentiment. Heavier energy costs have numerous negativeimplications for a manufacturing-focused energy importer likeSouth Korea," said Y.S. Rhoo, a market analyst at HyundaiSecurities.	 Tokyo's Nikkei average , Australia's S&P/ASX 200index and South Korea's KOSPI fell more than onepercent each, tracking a weaker Wall Street close.	 Wall Street erased most of its weekly gains on Friday, withthe S&P 500 Index falling by 0.74 percent, as fears ofmore geopolitical turmoil overshadowed positive U.S. data. 	 The CBOE Volatility Index , Wall Street's fear gauge,rose slightly to 19.11 but stayed well below a May peak of 48.	 Rising tensions in the Middle East also stoked demand forprecious metals and government bonds.	  Gold , often sought in times of geopoliticaltensions, rose to near a lifetime high at $1,434.60 an ounce,while silver surged 3 percent to 31-year highs as investorspiled into safe havens. Gold hit a record $1,440 last week.	 Treasury debt prices stabilised after Friday's gains withbenchmark ten year notes at 3.49 percent, a shadeabove a one-month low of 3.39 percent hit earlier this month.	 In currencies, the dollar struggled against a basket ofmajor currencies after failing to get a big boost fromthe U.S. data, while the euro was supported onexpectations of an interest rate hike next month from a hawkishEuropean Central Bank.	 The kiwi dollar held above a one-year low versusthe euro and a five-month low against the dollar but is set tostay pressured ahead of an expected interest rate cut this week.(Additional reporting by Ian Chua in SYDNEY, Alejandro Barbajosain SINGAPORE and Antoni Slodkowski in TOKYO)	  * For Reuters Global Investing Blog, click on 	 http://blogs.reuters.com/globalinvesting 	 * For the MacroScope Blog, click on 	 http://blogs.reuters.com/macroscope 	 * For Hedge Fund Blog, click on 	 http://blogs.reuters.com/hedgehub	  		 (Edited  by Ramya Venugopal)             ]]></raw>
