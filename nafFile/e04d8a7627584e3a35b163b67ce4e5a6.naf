<raw><![CDATA[  * Euro triggers stops under $1.4250, hits 5-mth low vs GBP  * Euro vulnerable on concern over Greece, soft data  * Kiwi hurt by inflation numbers, drags Aussie lower  By Satomi Noguchi  TOKYO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly onWednesday, hitting a four-month low against the dollar on concernabout Greece's fiscal problems and breaking below a key chartlevel that could signal a bearish trend for the currency. The euro's slide below its 200-day moving average of around$1.4296 initially gave investors a technical sign to sell thecurrency, and its break below $1.4250 and the December low near$1.4220 later triggered loss-cutting orders and sparked broadeuro-selling, traders said. The euro dropped to a five-month trough versus sterling. "We still need to see whether the euro's fall will betemporary or something of a big trend. But one thing that's clearfor now is that people are in the mood to get out of risky bets,including on the Aussie," said a senior trader for a Japanesesecurities firm. The euro was hurt in the previous session by abigger-than-expected decline in German investor sentiment, whichadded to woes inflicted by flagging market confidence in Greekpublic finances. Analysts say concerns about Greece and other European unionmembers' ability to deal with swelling budget deficits combinedwith lacklustre growth will weigh on the euro. The euro fell as low as $1.4180, a lowest since Sept. 1 whenthe currency resumed its bull run to a November high of $1.5145.After having erased nearly all of those late-year gains, theSeptember low of $1.4177 is seen as the next support or anotherkey level that could increase the euro's downside risk. The euro was later stabilising around $1.4225, but still down0.4 percent on the day. Against sterling, the euro slid as low as86.98 pence, the lowest since late August, before trading at87.11 pence, down 0.2 percent. The euro fell 0.4 percent to 129.72 yen. The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performanceagainst six other major currencies, was up 0.5 percent at 77.895. The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 91.35 yen, recovering from afour-week low of 90.31 yen hit in the previous session on tradingplatform EBS. It managed to hold above the key 90.05/35 supportzone, helped partly by higher yields on U.S. Treasuries. NZD, AUD FALL Earlier in the day, the New Zealand dollar dropped aftersofter-than-expected inflation data cooled expectations of aninterest rate rise anytime soon. That dragged down the Aussie as the Australian consumer priceindex (CPI) figures have a habit of echoing surprises in the Kiwinumbers. That means there is a risk that next week's Aussie CPI reportcould be softer than expected. Traders said talk that China had asked banks to stop lendingfor the rest of January also hurt demand for the Aussie and NewZealand dollars, as any sign of tightening in China usually hurtscommodity-linked currencies. The kiwi dropped 0.8 percent to $0.7296, while the Aussiefell 0.6 percent to $0.9177. (Additional reporting by Anirban Nag in Sydney; Editing by DavidDolan and Hugh Lawson)             ]]></raw>
