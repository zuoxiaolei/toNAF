<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar supported after previous day's slide in oil prices * Euro hurt by lingering debt problems, hits 7-week low vsGBP * Aussie dollar tumbles to 1-week low after surprisinglyweak job data By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, May 12 (Reuters) - The dollar dipped but held near athree-week high against a basket of currencies on Thursday as arout in commodities and an uncertain outcome on Greece's debtproblems lowered risk appetite and prompted traders to expectmore unwinding of dollar-funded bets on risk assets, with itsbreak above a trendline pointing to the chance of more gains. The euro, bruised by concern that the problems in Greececould spin out of control despite policymakers' efforts tosupport it, hovered just above a three-week low against thedollar after having broken below its 55-day moving average, andtouched a 1-Â½   month low against the pound. Adding momentum to a sell-off in commodity-linkedcurrencies, the Australian dollar tumbled more than 1 percent toa one-week low after surprisingly weak Australian jobs datareduced market expectations of a rate hike. The decline in the euro and the Aussie dollar also reflecteda broader recovery in the U.S. dollar, with its index against abasket of currencies having shot up to a three-week high onWednesday, and more importantly breaking above a trendline thathas capped it during its relentless fall since the beginning ofthis year. "It has broken above a trendline that has lasted for fourmonths. So you'd think the adjustment will be quite big," saidKoji Fukaya, chief FX strategist at Credit Suisse. The index , which has risen about 3.5 percent from athree-year low of 72.696 hit last week, last stood at 75.26,down 0.1 percent on the day but still holding near a three-weekhigh of 75.419 struck on Wednesday. Fukaya said it could target 77, a 50 percent retracement ofits decline since January. Before that, a 38.2 percentretracement sits just under 76. "People have been doing dollar-carry trades and yen-carrytrades based on a moderate recovery in the global economy. Thatmoney is now flowing back," said Makoto Noji, a seniorstrategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. Such trade had been popular because many market players betthat a moderate recovery in the global economy, led by red-hotgrowth in emerging economies, would boost demand for oil andother commodities while the Federal Reserve, concerned by stillhigh unemployment, is likely to keep U.S. interest rates nearzero for the near term, allowing speculators to borrow at littlecost to fund their positions. OIL'S SLIDE But oil prices tumbled over 4 percent on Wednesday after anunexpected rise in gasoline stocks amid slowing demand sentprices into a tailspin, fuelling the second big commoditiessell-off in a week. "Oil prices had risen from around $80-90 after revolutionsin the Middle East raised worries about oil supply. If you thinkthe situation there is stabilising, you could argue that oilcould fall back to levels from before that. That would mean moreupside for the dollar," said Credit Suisse's Fukaya. The euro traded at $1.4218 , up 0.2 percent on the dayafter having fallen to $1.4172 on Wednesday, its lowest in threeweeks. Sporadic buying set in after the euro had bounced off majorsupport levels around $1.4150 -- near the mid-April low and a38.2 percent retracement of the January-May rise to around$1.4145. There could be more bargain-hunting bids just above thetop of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart, at $1.4118. The euro also rebounded from a six-week low of 114.56 yen onWednesday to fetch 115.45 yen , rising 0.4 percent onthe day. The euro rose 0.1 percent against sterling to 0.8689 pound, having dipped to 0.86735 pound earlier on Thursday,the euro's lowest since late March. Sterling was supported afterthe Bank of England raised its inflation forecasts, leadingmarkets to bring forward the possible timing of an interest ratehike. The euro's outlook remained murky as speculation overwhether Greece will receive more bailout funding kept riskappetite volatile as investors continued to price in a highprobability that the country will eventually need to restructureits debt. While many in financial markets tend to view the debt messin Greece and other peripheral euro zone countries as beingcontained and unlikely to hurt the euro zone's bigger economies,some analysts say investors should not underestimate the impactbecause falls in Greek, Irish and Portuguese bond prices arecausing sharp losses to European banks and could hit thefinancial system. "Remember that 80 years ago, Austria's Creditanstalt wentdown. Although people thought the impact of a bank failure in asmall European country would not be big, it affected othercountries and snowballed into a financial crisis on a globalscale. You shouldn't think that the current debt problems areperipheral," said Mitsuru Saito, chief economist at Tokai TokyoSecurities. A broad recovery in the dollar also pushed the U.S. currencyto a one-week high against the yen. The dollar rose as high as81.35 yen . The Australian dollar fell as low as $1.0585 , downnearly 4 percent from a 29-year peak hit last week. After paringsome of its losses, the Australian dollar last stood at $1.0638,down 0.6 percent on the day.
