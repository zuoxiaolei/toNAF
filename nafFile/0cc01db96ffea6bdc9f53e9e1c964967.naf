<raw><![CDATA[ * Market was expecting above-target inflation for 5 years * This week's rate hike bigger than almost all forecasts * Yield curve flattens a bit in response * Some switch from inflation-linked to fixed-rate bonds * But still not clear if more half-point hikes on the way  By Steven Scheer JERUSALEM, March 30 (Reuters) - Central banks around theworld are struggling to regain their inflation-fightingcredibility in the face of high commodity prices, but the Bankof Israel may have succeeded -- for now at least -- with anaggressive interest rate hike. Israel's central bank on Monday raised its benchmark lendingrate by a larger-than-expected half a percentage point to 3.0percent. Virtually all analysts had predicted a third straightquarter-point move from the bank's governor Stanley Fischer. "The bravest central banker in the world", read a headlinein the Haaretz newspaper. Haaretz columnist Eytal Avriel wrote on Tuesday that Fischerwas not the only central banker facing a terrible dilemmabetween supporting economic growth and keeping a lid oninflation and asset bubbles -- but that he might be moreeffective than most. "Many will think Fischer is crazy. But Fischer is simplydoing his job properly, uncompromisingly, ignoring politicalpressure," Avriel said. "Other central bank governors are the crazy ones. They arekeeping interest rates too low and sacrificing the medium andlong term for the short term." In its rate hike statement, the central bank cited a highinflation environment of more than 4 percent and expandingeconomic activity; the economy grew an annualised 7.7 percent inthe fourth quarter of 2010. [ID:nLDE72R1Z6] "The pre-emptive move to hike rates more than expected willbe conducive for restoring the Bank of Israel's credibility,"said Kubilay Ozturk, an economist at Deutsche Bank. "This will also send a good signal to the markets thatinflationary expectations will not remain unanchored."  PRESSURE Before the latest rate increase, the Bank of Israel hadalready boosted its key rate eight times since August 2009 froma low of 0.5 percent. But as consumer prices started to riserapidly in the past few months, repeatedly topping analysts'monthly forecasts, many investors believed policymakers werelosing the battle with inflation. Despite the rate hikes, the benchmark 10-year governmentbond yield  rose 30 basis points over the pastmonth, peaking at 5.35 percent on Monday just before the latestrate move. In all, the yield -- a barometer for the inflationoutlook -- jumped some 70 bps since the beginning of the year. That trend was at least temporarily reversed on Tuesday,when the 10-year yield slipped to 5.33 percent, while short-termyields rose to reflect expectations for more rate hikes thisyear. Most analysts and the Bank of Israel's own model nowforecast the key rate rising another percentage point to 4.0percent by the end of the year. [ID:nLDE72T1KA] Gil Chen, head bond trader at the IBI brokerage, said therehad been heavy selling of inflation-linked bonds in favour offixed-rate bonds after the Bank of Israel's action. HSBC economist Jonathan Katz noted that before the latesthike, the market was expecting inflation to exceed thegovernment's target of 1 to 3 percent for the next five years.It is not yet clear how much those expectations are changing;the central bank will next release monthly data on inflationexpectations in late April. [ID:nLDE72L0LH] But Katz said, "People were basically saying that he willconsistently miss the inflation target, so he was losing a bitof credibility. I think he has regained that in part."  SHEKEL Inflation, boosted by housing, energy and food costs,reached an annual rate of 4.2 percent in February and isexpected by private analysts to stay around 4 percent for therest of 2011. [ID:nJES000058]  Fischer had been reluctant to move interest rates more thana quarter-point at a time to prevent rapid appreciation of theshekel  , which would damage exports -- more than40 percent of Israel's econonic activity. The shekel, currently at a 29-month high of 3.51 per dollar,has moved little since the latest rate hike, largely because ofexpectations that the central bank could intervene in the marketif necessary or authorities could conceivably impose strictercapital controls. Also, investors are expecting a European Central Bankinterest rate hike next week, while the U.S. Federal Reservemight raise rates sooner than originally anticipated. Analysts are unsure whether Monday's half-point increase inIsrael was a one-off event or the start of a trend for thecentral bank. But Barclays economist Daniel Hewitt, the lone analyst whohad predicted a half-point move this week in a Reuters poll,expects a similar move next month. "Its gradual rate increases have not been enough to keepinflation under control," he said of quarter-point hikes. David Lubin, an emerging markets strategist at Citigroup,wrote in a note to clients that the half-point hike "appears tobe an admission of failure to some extent and probably leavesthe market in a state of confusion about how the bank willpursue its tightening strategy."
