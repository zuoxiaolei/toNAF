<raw><![CDATA[ * 2010 GDP growth seen at 1.3 pct * Quaden says growth still too modest  (Recasts, Adds detail) BRUSSELS, June 16 (Reuters) - Belgium's central bank onWednesday raised its forecasts for economic growth and inflationthis year, but said debt-to-GDP would top 100 percent. The economy will grow by 1.3 percent this year, slightlymore than previously forecast, and by 1.7 percent in 2011 aftercontracting by 3.0 percent in 2009, Central bank governor GuyQuaden said. Quaden, presenting the bank's spring economic forecasts,said for industrialised countries, 2009 had been the worst yearin economic terms since World War II. "It is a severe recession, but it will not be a severedepression," Quaden, a member of the European Central Bank'sGoverning Council said, adding: "Growth is still too modest." Belgium's ratio of debt to gross domestic product ratiowould once again rise above 100 percent this year as a result ofthe financial crisis and the bailout of the country's banks,Quaden said, having dipped to as low as 84.2 percent in 2007from a high of 133.6 percent in 1993. Belgium's public sector deficit was forecast at 5.0 percentthis year, revised from 5.4 percent. For next year, the bankforecast a deficit of 5.3 percent. The bank also raised its 2010 inflation forecast to 2.0percent from 1.6 percent. For 2011, it saw inflation at 1.9percent. Inflation would be driven by food and petrol prices. Inflation in Belgium peaked at 5.9 percent in July 2008, buthas fallen sharply since then. Quaden said there was no fear of permanent negativeinflation.
