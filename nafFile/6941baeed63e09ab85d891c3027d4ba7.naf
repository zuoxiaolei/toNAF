<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro up 1 percent vs dlr, sustained by relief at bankrules * China data boosts risk appetite, helping Aussie shine  (Updates prices, adds quote) By Jessica Mortimer LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - The euro rose 1 percent againstthe dollar on Monday as relief at new global banking regulationsand upbeat Chinese data lifted investor appetite for currenciesseen as higher-risk. Global regulators agreed tough new capital requirements forbanks on Sunday, but these were broadly as expected and marketsreacted positively as lenders were given longer than expected tocomply with the rules. Forecast-beating Chinese economic numbers also helped propelthe higher-yielding Australian dollar to its highest since lateApril versus the greenback. "Better risk appetite is putting the dollar under pressureand the euro and currencies like the Australian dollar have beenholding up very well," said Niels Christensen, currencystrategist at Nordea in Copenhagen. The euro extended gains after stop loss orders weretriggered around $1.2750/70 and then above $1.2800. It brokeabove its 55-day moving average at $1.2815. At 0944 GMT, the euro was up 1 percent against the dollar at$1.2802. It also rose 0.9 percent against the low-yielding yen to 107.63 yen. New Basel III rules agreed on Sunday will require banks tomore than triple the amount of top-quality capital they hold inreserve but gave them longer than expected to comply. Thislifted equities, with European shares up 1.1 percent. The European Commission forecasting the euro zone economywill grow this year almost twice as fast as previously thoughtalso supported sentiment towards the euro. Analysts said the euro was targeting $1.2920, a level itfailed to break above earlier this month, but warned it wouldremain within its recent range unless it topped that level.   YEN FALLS, AUSSIE GAINS The yen fell broadly, though it rose against the dollar,which cut earlier gains to trade down 0.1 percent at 84.03 yen,not far from a recent 15-year low of 83.34 yen. This kept alive jitters about whether Japanese authoritiesmay step in to curb yen gains before a party leadership vote onTuesday in which Prime Minister Naoto Kan is being challenged bypowerbroker Ichiro Ozawa, who has said he favours intervention. "The price action suggests investors are using anyoppotunity of yen weakness to buy back the currency," said SimonDerrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon. He said there was a growing sense in the market that ifJapan were to intervene it would have to act unilaterally andwould therefore have limited success. Derrick added that concerns about euro zone sovereign debtproblems and a faltering U.S. economic recovery had not goneaway and the safe-haven qualities of currencies such as the yenand the Swiss franc remained attractive to investors. Traders said the dollar was caught in a range versus the yenas bids from Japanese importers around 83.50-80 yen werecountered by exporter offers reported above 84.20 yen. Weekend data showed Chinese factories ramped up productionin August and money growth topped expectations, indicating theeconomy remained buoyant. That helped the Australian dollar rise more than 0.6 percentto a high of $0.9330. It faces resistance at the April high of$0.9389 and then its 2009 peak at $0.9407. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed currencyspeculators slightly raised net long yen positions in the weekending Sept. 7, just before the yen's latest 15-year high. Theyalso raised net long position in the Australian dollar. (Additional reporting by Charlotte Cooper in Tokyo)             ]]></raw>
