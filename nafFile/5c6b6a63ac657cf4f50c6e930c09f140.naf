<raw><![CDATA[ * Greek cabinet unveils 4.8 bln euro austerity plan * Euro edges higher, but sentiment remains fragile * U.S. private sector sheds 20,000 jobs in February (Adds quote, updates prices; changes byline, dateline,previous LONDON) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - The euro rose against theU.S. dollar on Wednesday after the Greek government endorsed a4.8 billion euro austerity package, boosting hopes the heavilyindebted country would get help from the European Union. The euro gained roughly half a U.S. cent after a governmentsource told Reuters the Greek cabinet decided on the plan,which included a rise in value added tax to 21 percent and acut in public sector salary bonuses by 30 percent. Trading in the euro/dollar was volatile and marketsremained wary over whether the plan would be enough for Athensto win financial support from Germany and France. "We believe today's developments go a long way towardspacifying the markets which have become preoccupied withfragmentation risk in the region," said Boris Schlossberg,director of currency research at GFT in New York. "If the Germans and the French offer support for Greece,the sense of crisis may lift from the markets and the EUR/USDcould see a short covering relief rally over the next severalweeks," he added. The euro briefly came under pressure after a Germangovernment spokesman said Germany would not offer any aid toGreece on Friday when Chancellor Angela Merkel meets GreekPrime Minister George Papandreou in Berlin. In early New York trading, the euro was 0.4 percent higheron the day at $1.3657. Stop-losses were seen at $1.3680 with atechnical target at $1.3693, traders said. On Tuesday, the euro fell as low as $1.3432, its weakestsince mid-May 2009. Greece's fiscal crisis has helped drive theeuro down nearly 10 percent against the dollar since December. Against the yen, the dollar traded little changed at 88.75yen, after earlier hitting as low as 88.47 yen on electronictrading platform EBS, its lowest since December. The dollar gained versus the Japanese currency immediatelyafter data showing U.S. private employers shed 20,000 jobs inFebruary, fewer than the 60,000 jobs lost in January. "We're clearly getting to that stage where the employmentsituations is looking less bad," says Matthew Strauss, seniorcurrency strategist, at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
