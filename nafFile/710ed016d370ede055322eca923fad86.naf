<raw><![CDATA[ Sept 3 (Reuters) - Almost a year after the world's financialsystem narrowly averted collapse, finance ministers and centralbankers from the Group of 20 rich and developing nations willgather in London on Sept. 4-5 to discuss what happens next. Here is a summary of progress reported so far on pledges theleaders made in London in April on measures to avert a repeat ofthe Great Depression of the 1930s and to reduce the risk offuture crises.  * FISCAL MEASURES TO BOOST DEMAND RAPIDLY G20 leaders' communique from the April London summit saystotal fiscal expansion will amount to $5 trillion by end of2010, raising output by 4 percent. IMF staff estimatediscretionary fiscal stimulus from the G20 is close to thedesired 2.0 percent of GDP in 2009 and 1.6 percent in 2010. * REFORM OF BRETTON WOODS INSTITUTIONS G20 leaders in April agreed to accelerate reforms includingincreasing IMF surveillance of the global economy and givingmajor emerging economies more voting power. Not much progress. United States seeking an agreement at the G20 meeting inPittsburgh on moving the voting issue forward and has kicked offthe talks by proposing a 5 percent shift in voting power ofunderrepresented emerging markets.  * MONETARY POLICY STEPS AS APPROPRIATE Central banks around the world have begun to debate how andwhen to phase out emergency steps taken to contain the damagewrought by the financial crisis, although most are not expectedto withdraw support until well into next year. Major central bank interest rates remain at record orhistoric lows, many of them close to zero, and policymakers arecautious about a recent pick-up in economic data suggesting arecovery could start sooner than earlier expected. The Bank of England unexpectedly extended its quantitativeeasing program by 50 billion pounds ($82 billion) last month,and the U.S. Federal Reserve is also buying debt to inject moneyinto the economy. The European Central Bank's smaller programmeof buying 60 billion euros in covered bonds is on track forcompletion by the middle of next year. Central banks have also cooperated in setting up swap linesto help each other's banks and those in emerging marketeconomies get the foreign currency they need to avert crises.  * RESISTING PROTECTIONISM AND PROMOTING TRADE The G20 leaders in April repeated their pledge of Novemberto refrain from raising new barriers to trade, imposing newexport restrictions or taking measures to stimulate exportsinconsistent with international trade rules. World Trade Organisation director-general Pascal Lamy saidin July there had been no outbreak of "high-intensityprotectionism" but countries had not dismantled economicbarriers raised in the downturn, which was far from over, andthere was a risk of a rash of trade disputes as a result. The United States is still under scrutiny by its tradingpartners about elements of its "Buy American" clause as acondition for some of the government's support packages despitePresident Barack Obama forcing Congress to water it down. China has come under attack for a similar "Buy China" policyin its stimulus package. The European Union and United Statesalso launched a WTO case over Chinese export restrictions on keyindustrial raw materials. An increasingly assertive China has launched a case againstthe EU over measures against imports of Chinese screws and boltsand a dispute with the United States over a U.S. ban in Chinesepoultry imports. But some people argue this and other new cases show theglobal trade system is working well to handle disputes despitethe crisis. In past weeks the WTO has laid out the sanctionsBrazil can impose over U.S. cotton subsidies, cleared the wayfor Japanese sanctions against the United States overanti-dumping measures, and ruled against China's regime forimporting and distributing audivisual material. The April summit also promised to aim for a deal in theWTO's long-running Doha round, but did not set a deadline. TheG8+ summit in L'Aquila in July called for a Doha deal in 2010.Trade ministers at last month's OECD meeting in Paris saidthey wanted to make concrete progress on Doha before September'sG20 in Pittsburgh.The G20 in April also promised at least $250 billion over thenext two years to support trade finance.  * REGULATORY OVERHAUL BANK CAPITAL: Still working on proposals for banks to buildup extra buffers of capital during good times to tap in troubledmarkets and thus lessen the need for taxpayer bailouts. HEDGE FUNDS: The G20 agreed hedge funds above a certain sizeshould be authorised and obliged to report data to supervisors.There are national differences over how this can be done withoutgiving  unfair advantages to financial institutions in somecountries. DERIVATIVES: Central clearing of credit default swaps tradedin the EU began at the end of July. The United States wants allstandardised credit derivatives traded on an exchange, goingbeyond what the EU is currently proposing. ACCOUNTING: The International Accounting Standards Board(IASB) is fast tracking revision to the scope of the fair valuerule -- blamed for amplifying the credit crunch -- to get keyparts in force by the G20 deadline of end-2009. SECURITISATION: EU has adopted a law mandating banks toretain 5 percent of the securitised products they sell, withUnited States considering a similar move. CREDIT RATING AGENCIES: G20 wants them registered andsupervised by the end of 2009. EU has adopted a law mandatingregistration and direct supervision. FINANCIAL SUPERVISION: EU leaders have agreed to set up aEuropean Systemic Risk Board in 2010. New American framework formonitoring systemic risk still under debate. PAY: EU working on plans to give supervisors powers tointervene in bank pay policies if they encourage too much risktaking. Basel Committee of central bankers and supervisors isworking on guidance for supervisors on remuneration.   * FUNDS FOR THE IMF TO SUPPORT EMERGING ECONOMIES G20 leaders pledged in April to boost IMF resources byanother $500 billion and sell about 400 tonnes of IMF gold toraise money for the poorest countries. Most of the money hasbeen raised, with Russia, China and Brazil agreeing tocontribute through IMF note purchases -- the first time the IMFhas issued bonds to central banks to raise money. European Union member countries said on Wednesday they hadagreed to increase the bloc's contribution to IMF funds to 125billion euros ($178 billion) from 75 billion pledged in March. The U.S. Congress has endorsed the gold sale, allowing theFund to move ahead with plans to sell it within a new Europeancentral bank gold agreement struck in August. The G20 agreed in April to provide $250 billion worth of IMFSpecial Drawing Rights to all 186 member countries to boostglobal liquidity. The allocation became effective on Aug. 28.Emerging and developing countries received almost $100 billionin SDRs, of which close to $18 billion went to poor countries.  * REMAIN COMMITTED TO COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE U.S. President Barack Obama said a major emitters forum(MEF) meeting in Italy had agreed finance ministers shouldreport back on climate finance at the G20 summit in Pittsburghin September -- raising expectations that the issue will bediscussed in London this week. In July, G8 countries committed to cut their emissions by 80percent by 2050. All major emitters -- including emergingeconomies such as China and India -- referred to a target tolimit global warming to no more than 2 degrees centigrade,recognising a scientific view that this was a safety limit. G8 countries have agreed an ambition to halve globalgreenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Developing countries continueto resist that target. No deal yet on their demand for developedcountries to help pay their costs in fighting climate change.
