<raw><![CDATA[ * All countries must set tougher climate goals-Ban * Rich need to set a 2020 figure for climate aid  By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent COPENHAGEN, Dec 16 (Reuters) - All nations should settougher goals for combating global warming at a U.N. summit andthe rich should spell out how much aid they will give the poorby 2020, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday. "We are just three days away from a final deal inCopenhagen. I am reasonably optimistic," Ban told ReutersInsider television during the Dec. 7-18 conference, which isseeking a new U.N. deal to slow climate change. "I have been urging both developed and developing countriesthat they should all come on board. I think that they can andmust do more, in terms of mitigation (curbing emissions), interms of financial support packages," he said. "Financial support for developing countries is one of thekeys in getting this deal agreed in Copenhagen," he said,denying a media report that he had given up a drive to get thesummit to set a figure for aid by 2020. Ban said a summit of more than 120 world leaders on Fridayneeded to work out mechanisms for raising aid, a formula forsharing it and decide "how much money can be provided -- thatmeans size of financial support. These are keys." He said the exact amount was up to member states. Developingnations are insisting on a number but some rich nations say itwill be hard to put in a figure -- such as $100 billion a yearsuggested by African nations by 2020. Analysts say that a problem is that such a figure mightdiscourage some U.S. Senators from passing carbon-capping laws.They may fear promising cash for other nations at a time of highdomestic unemployment.  QUICK START The United Nations also wants member states to come up with$10 billion a year from 2010-12 as a quick start for a deal tohelp developing nations cope with global warming that will bringmore floods, droughts, mudslides and rising sea levels. "That is a good start but this is just a start," Ban said ofthe $10 billion goal. Ban said the existing Kyoto Protocol, binding almost alldeveloped nations to curb emissions until 2012, might bereplaced by a new pact despite opposition from developing stateswho insist Kyoto should be extended. "We think that this Kyoto Protocol should remain in force aslong as we continue our negotiations," he said. "Ideally speaking, if we can agree a comprehensive dealwhich can cover all the elements, that is fine. Otherwise, Ithink the Kyoto Protocol should continue," he said. "Climate change is happening and accelerating much muchfaster than one realises," he said. He also said that the world should set a goal of at leasthalving world greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Developingnations led by China and India have opposed such a goal beforerich nations make much deeper cuts in their emissions by 2050. "At a minimum, the member states should agree...cutting inhalf by 2050," he said. He said he was encouraged that so many world leaders -- morethan 120 -- were going to attend. He said that about 80 attendeda climate summit in 2007, and about 100 this year in September."This is the largest ever," he said.             ]]></raw>
