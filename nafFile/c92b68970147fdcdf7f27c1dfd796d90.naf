<raw><![CDATA[ BEIJING, Sept 15 (Reuters) - It would be appropriate forChina to allow the yuan to appreciate, but a stronger currencywould not be a panacea for the country's structural problems,World Bank President Robert Zoellick said on Wednesday. He said China's main priority is to enact structural changesto spur domestic demand. But a stronger yuan would send a price signal that would helpreinforce a shift away from export-led growth, said Zoellick, whowas speaking at a news conference at the end of a week-long visitto mark the 30th anniversary of the start of the Washingtonlender's partnership with China.
