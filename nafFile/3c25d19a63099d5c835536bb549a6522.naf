<raw><![CDATA[ * MSCI index ex-Japan falls 1.7 pct, Nikkei down 1.8 pct * Gold up 1 pct, copper down 4 pct on Greek fears * Yen benefits as safe haven By Chikako Mogi	 TOKYO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Asian stocks extended losses onTuesday from the previous day's steep declines as investorscontinued to flee from riskier assets on growing doubts overGreece's ability to avoid default, fuelling fears of globalfinancial turmoil and recession.	 MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.53 percent, hovering near a 16-month lowhit in late September. It fell about 3.6 percent on Monday.	 Japan's Nikkei fell 1.7 percent. 	 Global stocks fell to a 15-month low onMonday, with financial shares hit hard on fears over the bankingsector's exposure to euro zone sovereign debt.	 Franco-Belgian financial group Dexia called anemergency board meeting after concerns about its exposure toGreece.	 Oil fell more than $1 on Tuesday, pressured by the debtconcerns and a stronger dollar. U.S. crude  fell to anintraday low of $75.92 a barrel, while Brent crude  fellto as low as $100.52. 	 The yen, often regarded as safe haven, hovered near a10-year peak against the euro and held firm against the dollar. 	 Investor preference for safer assets accelerated flows intogold, pushing the market up 1 percent while copper tumbled 4percent as investors dumped the industrial metal on worries overa slowdown in growth and turned to dollar holdings.	 The market's overwhelming focus on Greece's financial woesovershadowed a better-than-expected reading from the U.S.Institute of Supply Management's September manufacturing indexand a rise in construction spending, potential evidence that theU.S. economy can avoid a recession.	 European policymakers met on Monday to discuss ways toleverage the euro zone's rescue fund and pressure Greece toimplement agreed structural reforms.
