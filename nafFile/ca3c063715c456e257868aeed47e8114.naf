<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar teeters towards new low vs yen on gloomier Fedview * Nikkei sheds 2.7 pct as firmer yen hurts exporters * Tech plays lead Asia stocks lower after US downgrades * European stocks follow Asia into the red By Kevin Yao SINGAPORE, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The dollar teetered toward a15-year low against the yen on Wednesday after the FederalReserve gave a more pessimistic assessment of the weakeningU.S. economy, while technology plays dragged Asian stockslower. Major European stocks fell 0.5 percent in early trade,while U.S. Treasury futures hit their highest in 17 monthsafter the Fed announced it would buy more government bonds tohelp shore up flagging growth. Markets are still awaiting further details on the Fed plan,but analysts doubted the amount of the purchases would be largeenough to have a substantial stimulative impact. Some market watchers believe the Fed's move could actuallyfuel more concern about the economy, hurting investors'appetite for riskier assets such as stocks and commodities. "The Fed will take more actions in the future to injectmore money into the bank system. You can say that's the secondwave of quantative easing," said Daniel Chan, chief economistand wealth management strategist BWC Capital markets in HongKong. "That will be positive for U.S. treasuries market but notpositive for global stock markets," he added. The U.S. central bank said on Tuesday it would reinvest themoney from maturing mortgage bonds it holds into governmentdebt to counter recent signs of economic weakness. It leftinterest rates near zero and renewed its pledge to keep themlow for an extended period. U.S. Treasuries prices rallied, with yields on thebenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note falling to 2.7416 percent,the lowest in more than four months. September futures on the 10-year Treasury note rose 8.5/32to 125-8/32 after hitting a 17-month peak at 125-9/32. The step marked an important policy shift for the Fed,which only a few months ago debated how to start rolling backsome of its emergency stimulus schemes put in place during theglobal financial crisis. But the Fed's more sombre assessment of the economy addedmore pressure on the ailing U.S. dollar, which continued toweaken against the yen. Japan's Nikkei average dropped 2.7 percent, as yen strengthand worries about weaker demand undermined shares of exporters.Honda Motor Co and Canon Inc both shed 3.3 percent, while SonyCorp fell 2.8 percent. "Worries about a further strengthening in the yen againstthe dollar grew after the Fed's new steps towards easing policyand with the Bank of Japan maintaining the status quo," saidMasaru Hamasaki, a senior strategist at Toyota AssetManagement. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan fell1.5 percent, dragged down by tech counters after brokeragesdowngraded their business outlooks for several major U.S.sector bellwethers. Overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average and theStandard & Poor's 500 Index fell but closed off their lowsafter the Fed pledged to underpin the recovery. But tech companies pressured the Nasdaq, with chipmakersIntel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc falling on analysts'downgrades, while Novell Inc dropped a day after cutting itsthird-quarter revenue outlook. and Korean shares fell 1.3 percent as Hynix Semiconductor, theworld's No.2 memory chip producer, tumbled nearly 6.2 percentfollowing the selloff in U.S. chipmakers. Asian traders saw some comfort in fresh data from China,however, which confirmed its strong economic growth wasmoderating but showed no signs it was in danger of a hardlanding. DOLLAR FALTERS The dollar dipped a fifth of a percent to 85.32 yen edgingtowards an eight-month low of 85.02 yen hit last week. If itslips below November's low of 84.82 yen, it would mark thecurrency's weakest level in 15 years. "The dollar could fall below 85.00 yen at any moment," saysShuichi Kanehira, head of FX spot trading at Mizuho CorporateBank. The Australian dollar shed 0.9 percent against the yen to77.35 yen the euro lost 0.4 percent to 111.75 yen and sterlingfell 0.5 percent to 134.78 yen The low-yielding yen is a funding currency for carry tradesand tends to rise in times of market stress. Elsewhere, oil fell 66 cents to $79.59 a barrel on demandconcerns after data showing a rise in U.S. crude importsovershadowed a deeper-than-expected decline in crude stocks. Spot gold gained 35 cents to $1,202.20 an ounce after theFed's move, still below a 3-week high of $1,212.61 hit lastweek.
