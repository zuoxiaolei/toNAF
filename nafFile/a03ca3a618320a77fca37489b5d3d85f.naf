<raw><![CDATA[ * Iraq may buy Mirage jets from Dassault * U.N. sanctions barred arms sales to Baghdad  BAGHDAD, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Iraq is seeking the return of651 million euros ($898 million) paid by Saddam Hussein'sgovernment for French Mirage fighters that were never deliveredbecause of sanctions, a government spokesman said on Thursday. Ali al-Dabbagh said talks with France's Dassault Aviation and the French defence ministry for the return of thefunds were positive, and Iraq was separately eyeing a possiblepurchase of an unspecified number of Mirage jets from Dassault. "We want these funds returned. Simultaneously, we are innegotiations with the French for (the purchase of) Mirage F1s,"Dabbagh said, adding that Iraq had not yet decided whether tobuy jets from France or the United States. An Iraqi committee was formed two months ago to negotiatethe return of the deposit for jets ordered under Saddam, andIraq expects the issue to be resolved this year, Dabbagh said. Sanctions imposed on Iraq shortly after its invasion ofKuwait in 1990 prohibited arms sales to Baghdad, forcing theabandonment of its deal with Dassault for the fighter jets.
