<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro and commodity currencies surge in thin trade * Australian dollar hits new post-float high * Spanish auction shores up sentiment on common currency (Updates prices, changes dateline, previous LONDON) NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - The euro surged to itshighest in 15 months against a weaker dollar on Wednesday,boosted by higher risk appetite and after a bond auction fromSpain was well received by investors. The response to the Spanish auction provided a fillip tothe euro zone common currency which is eyeing its Jan. 13, 2010high. Traders said before that, the euro would have to clearoption barriers at $1.4550 and $1.4600. "This is not a euro-centric move and instead is a broadlybased U.S. dollar move," said Camilla Sutton, chief currencystrategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. "Loose U.S. monetarypolicy juxtaposed against a European tightening cycle, awarning from S&P that with no credible plan in place the U.S.risks the loss of its AAA status and negative U.S. dollarsentiment have pushed the euro zone problems to thebackground." The euro rose 1.4 percent versus the dollar to $1.4527,pulling further away from this week's low of around $1.4155.Traders said stop-losses were triggered through last week'shigh of $1.4521 and on the break of $1.4530. The euro jumped 1.5 percent to 120.17 yen, moving away froma two-week trough hit this week. Trading conditions were thinwith many dealers already out for the Easter break. Data showing business activity in Germany and Francecontinued to outpace the rest of the common currency bloc haskept alive European Central Bank rate hike expectations. Both the dollar and the yen are usually sold off when riskappetite is buoyant. Demand for riskier assets like stocks andhigher-yielding currencies picked up as upbeat corporateearnings in the U.S. raised growth expectations. Market sentiment was calmer after nerves were rattled onMonday by S&P's warning on U.S. credit ratings and on fearsthat Greece will have to restructure its debt. "Investor focus is on the earnings season in the U.S. andthis is key in driving growth expectations and pushing stockmarkets higher. This keeps the focus away from the euro zoneperiphery right now," said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategistat UBS in Zurich. COMMODITY CURRENCIES BUOYANT The chase for yields benefited the Australian dollar, whichhit a fresh post-float high of $1.0688. It last traded at$1.0662, up around 1.3 percent on the day. Traders said stop-losses were hit on the break of $1.0610and $1.0650. The Canadian dollar rose to its highest in over three yearsagainst its U.S. counterpart, buoyed by above-forecast Canadianinflation on Tuesday and rising commodity prices. All of which saw the dollar index fall to a 16-month low. Traders said talk of central banks recycling interventionproceeds into growth-linked currencies and the euro was alsoleading to a drop in the U.S. dollar. Still, the dollar managed to eke out modest gains versusthe yen. It rose 0.2 percent from late U.S. trade on Tuesday to82.7 yen. Traders said Japanese exporters' offers were layeredin the 83.20-83.50 area with stops seen above 83.50. Sterling fell sharply against the euro after Bank ofEngland minutes showed policymaker caution about economicgrowth outweighed inflation worries. The euro was at 88.60pence, up 0.9 percent on the day. (U.S. Treasury Desk; Editing by James Dalgleish)             ]]></raw>
