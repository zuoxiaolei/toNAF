<raw><![CDATA[ * Bill would allow government to start EU accession talks * Foreign ministry says expects bill to pass by next week  (Adds PM comment) By Omar Valdimarsson REYKJAVIK, July 10 (Reuters) - Iceland's parliament began afinal debate on Friday on whether to authorise the government ofthe economically crippled island nation to begin accession talkswith the European Union. Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir, elected earlier thisyear after the previous government fell amid protests over itsfailure to avert a financial meltdown that has devastated theeconomy, has made joining the 27-nation bloc a top priority. "We urgently want the application to Brussels by the 27th ofthis month in order to have an answer by the end of the year,"she told Icelandic television. She told parliament the island would have fared better inthe financial crisis had it been a part of the European Union. "We are close to a democratic and informed conclusion onthis important issue, a conclusion that will no doubt facilitateour economic recovery," she said. "I don't doubt for a minutethat we would be better off had we been EU members already whenthe calamity hit us last October." EU officials have said member states would probably lookfavourably on an Icelandic application, and negotiations couldmove quickly because the country already has strong EU ties. The resolution in the Althing would allow the coalition ofpro-EU Social Democrats and more EU-sceptical Left-Greens tonegotiate an accession deal with the bloc which would then beput before voters in a referendum."I have ascertained that the bill will go through by nextweek and I hope some of the opposition will support us," OssurSkarphedinsson, foreign minister and a senior Social Democratleader, was quoted as saying on daily Morgunbladid's website. Arni Thor Sigurdsson, chair of the foreign affairscommittee, told Reuters the debates would stretch into theweekend, with an extra parliamentary session on Saturday. Support for joining the EU has risen in Iceland since thecollapse of its main commercial banks and currency in Octoberlast year, forcing the country to seek aid from theInternational Monetary Fund and various European countries.  POWERFUL INTERESTS An opinion poll in May showed 61.2 percent of Icelanders infavour of accession talks, but powerful interests like thefishing industry oppose the idea, fearing EU membership wouldentail giving up cherished fishing rights. "This motion lacks heart. It lacks passion. There isprobably love for the EU in some parts, but it is not here,"Bjarni Benediktsson, leader of the opposition IndependenceParty, said in parliament of the government's proposal. EU membership was the main sticking point between the SocialDemocrats and the Left-Greens after their April election win,and they said in May they had "agreed to disagree" on the issue. Sigurdardottir and her Social Democrats have said a majorityin parliament favours kicking off accession talks despite thewavering support of some Left-Greens. The daily Frettabladid said on Friday the resolution wasexpected to pass by a narrow margin and estimated 33-35 of the63 Althing members supported it. It needs 32 votes to pass. The Social Democrats have 20 seats in parliament and the Left-Greens 14, but the party leaderships say members can voteas they please or abstain. Parliament's foreign affairs committee has spent weekssecuring backing for the government, trying to coax recalcitrantMPs to abandon an opposition proposal. The opposition has proposed holding one referendum onwhether to apply to the EU and, if Icelanders support that,another on whether to join. The government wants only one voteonce it gets a green light from EU member countries. The resolution is one of several key issues facing thegovernment, including parliamentary approval of its deal toreimburse Britain and the Netherlands for billions of pounds andeuros owed to savers with Icelandic accounts.
