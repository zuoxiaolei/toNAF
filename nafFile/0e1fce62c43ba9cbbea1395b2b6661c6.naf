<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar index down 0.4 pct at 74.70 * UAE central bank action seen as stabilizing * Yen slips after comments from Japanese officials(Updates prices, adds comment, changes byline, changesdateline, previous LONDON) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against theeuro and most major currencies on Monday after the United ArabEmirates central bank promised additional liquidity to localbanks, soothing concerns about a looming debt default. But market sentiment remained fragile, with the dollarbriefly trimming losses, after a top Dubai financial officialsaid the government does not guarantee Dubai World debt andDubai World creditors are responsible for their actions. The dollar's decline began earlier in the global session asAsian equities rallied on the UAE central bank's pledge toprovide emergency support to the region's banks and as Dubai'soil-rich neighbor, Abu Dhabi, offered to provide selectivesupport to Dubai companies. "We've seen risk aversion decrease from the levels we sawon Thursday," said Camilla Sutton, currency strategist atScotia Capital in Toronto. But she added that even though the U.S. dollar is slightlyweaker, most currencies are trading well within their recentranges. "All in all, last week just shows how vulnerablemarkets are to any fears." In early trading, the ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, agauge of the greenback's performance against six other majorcurrencies, was down 0.3 percent on the day at 74.788. Theindex touched a 15-month low of 74.170 last week. The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.5016, just over one centaway from last week's 15-month peak just above $1.5140. Against the yen, the dollar gained 0.1 percent to 86.52yen, rebounding from the 14-year low below the 85 level setlast week. U.S. stock futures pointed to a slightly higher open onoptimism over holiday retail sales and as concerns about Dubaidebt woes eased. "Should investors sweep the Dubai-related jitters under thecarpet, the dollar will likely face a further decline," saidAndrew Wilkinson, senior analyst at Interactive Brokers Groupin Greenwich, Connecticut. JAPAN SPEAKS UP The yen slipped after a Japanese government minister saidthe government has agreed to try to stem the currency's rise,although he didn't specify any measures. "In light of the Dubai shock, we want to respond moreaggressively than originally planned with an extra budget,"strategy minister Naoto Kan, who is also deputy prime minister,told reporters. "We also want to stop the yen's rise andcooperate with the BOJ." Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii denied a report that hewould not intervene in currency markets, saying he had neversaid intervention was impossible. Separately, Bank of JapanGovernor Masaaki Shirakawa said currency volatility wasundesirable. Derek Halpenny, European head of global currency strategyat Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, noted a "clear upturn" inTokyo's concern about deflation and the strong yen. "There's some speculation about intervention and what kindof policy measures will be put in place," he said. There was little immediate impact on China's yuan policyafter the euro zone's top economic officials met Chineseleaders over the weekend. The Australian dollar was up 0.7 percent at $0.9135, andthe New Zealand dollar was up 0.8 percent at US$0.7154. The Reserve Bank of Australia meets on Tuesday. A decisionto raise rates for a third straight time is seen as a closecall. Later in the week, investors will focus on the EuropeanCentral Bank's decision on its one-year funding operation as itis expected to keep key rates steady on Thursday. A U.S. jobs report on Friday is expected to show furtherimprovement, but will be watched as a gauge of economicrecovery.             ]]></raw>
