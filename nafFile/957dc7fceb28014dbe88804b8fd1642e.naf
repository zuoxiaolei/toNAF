<raw><![CDATA[ By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - For some people, investing in2009 was easy -- just put your money into oversold riskierassets and watch them rise. It looks like 2010 could be a lot more difficult, requiringselection and market timing to bring in the best results. In early March this year, investors decided that a) thefinancial system was not going to collapse into a new GreatDepression and b) as a result, riskier assets such as stocks andhigh-yielding bonds had sold off too much. The gains of 2009 -- as much as 30 percent for world stocksyear-to-date, 72 percent since early March -- came in the mainfrom across-the-board buying. The more sold-off the asset had been, the higher it rose asinvestors almost indiscriminately stampeded out of what had bythen become virtually zero-yielding cash funds in favor of anyyield they could find. It was essentially triggered by authorities making clearthey would not let another major bank go under, a la LehmanBrothers, and by central banks pumping liquidity into thesystem. Entering the new year, however, a lot of this has changed.Large price rises have eaten up what were seen as historicopportunities and central banks are preparing to haul back theliquidity. Some tight 2009 correlations are already breakingdown, leaving investors to work a bit harder for their buck. "2010 is going to be a year of discrimination with a verylong bias towards quality," said Bob Parker, vice chairman ofCredit Suisse's asset management arm. The need for more selective thinking also comes from thestate of the global economy, which although improving, is bothuneven and fragile. Investors have become more cautious aboutthe investment backdrop as a result, a caution intensified bydebt problems in Dubai, Greece, Spain and elsewhere. "Cyclical tailwinds and structural headwinds," is howWilliam De Vijlder, global chief investment officer of FortisInvestments, described the current investment climate.  QUALITY PLEASE What this means for equities is that investors are likely tobe much more selective in what they buy, even if they do stillbelieve that stocks will rally. Reuters polls showed on Wednesday that most investors areexpecting equities to continue rising next year, although atnothing like the same rate they have been. A quality pick, Credit Suisse's Parker said, would be acompany with low leverage, a high dividend and the expectationof keeping it, free cash flow, and a strong market share alsowith the ability to keep it. Wealth manager Banque de Luxembourg has a similar slant,seeing defensives such as utilities attracting attention. "It makes a lot of sense to go out of things that are verycyclical and to go into things that are more defensive and payinteresting dividends," said Guy Wagner, the bank's chiefinvestment officer. And as investors get picky about stocks, the same is likelyto go for regions and other asset classes. While emerging markets remain a favourite for many investorsin 2010, focus is mainly on fiscally sound countries in Asia,such as China, rather than on, say, eastern Europe. "(There will be) more differentiation rather than justbuying an asset class or region," said Wayne Bowers, chiefexecutive officer for Northern Trust Global Investments'international division. Northern Trust on Wednesday unveiled a euro zone governmentinflation-linked bond fund but constructed its benchmark toexclude Greece and Italy, two of the area's weaker elements. In effect, rather than just go underweight on those bonds,that said the fund simply wanted nothing to do with them.  WHAT IF? The big risk to this "be picky" scenario is that theassumptions about 2010's economic performance turn out to befalse. If -- and it is a big if -- global growth were to take offsharply, riskier assets would most likely continue the climbthat they have seen this year. True, such growth would bring with it earlier interest rateshikes and a quicker end to liquidity-pumping exercises bycentral banks. But the reasons would be positive, and the resulting selloff in government bonds would drive money into a broad swathe ofequities and the like. It is not expected to happen. But then again, who predictedthe booming risk market of 2009 this time last year?
