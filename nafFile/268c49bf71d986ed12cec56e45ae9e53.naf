<raw><![CDATA[ * Vontobel 2009 net 138 million Sfr vs forecast 135 million * Says client trust returning, recovery process not yet over * CEO says bank could make private bank buy * Net new money in private bank disappoints * Shares rise 1.7 percent (Recasts, adds further details) Martin de Sa'Pinto ZURICH, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Swiss private bank Vontobel's2009 net profit rose 22 percent as a doubling in trading incomeoutweighed a drop in fee and commission income, and cost-cuttingmeasures kicked in. Net new money at Vontobel's private bank disappointed,however, at 0.4 billion Swiss francs, including outflows of 0.2billion francs at the recently-acquired Commerzbank (Schweiz) asthe bank failed to capitalise on UBS's woes. "The volume of new money we attracted fell short of ourtargets. We have implemented measures in the wealth and assetmanagement business to clearly increase the inflow of new moneyin 2010," said Vontobel CEO Herbert Scheidt in a statement. Net profit climbed to 138 million Swiss francs ($128million), beating analyst expectations, as structured productsactivities accounted for a large chunk of the rise in tradingbusiness. Chief Executive Herbert Scheidt told Reuters in an interviewthe bank had begun to invest early in its onshore businesses inGermany and Italy, and had thus weathered the fallout well fromattacks on Switzerland's tax and secrecy laws. However, the bank was yet to capitalise on client defectionsfrom large rival UBS following that bank's damaging tax disputewith the U.S. government, with those clients opting forstate-backed rivals like ZKB. Total assets under management rose to 75.2 billion francs,with asset values, the Commerzbank (Schweiz) acquisition and netnew money all contributing, but net new money disappointed,particularly in private banking. Shares traded up 1.7 percent at 32.80 Swiss francs by 1136GMT, in line with the DJ Stoxx European banks index.  ACQUIRER, OR TARGET? Peter Thorne, an analyst at brokerage Helvea, said thebank's overall profitability was almost entirely dependent oninvestment banking, and it was having difficulty diversifyingaway from that business. "The harsh reality seems to be that the bank is sub-scale inprivate banking and even in asset management to earn decentprofits and demonstrate sustainable momentum," said Thorne in aresearch note. It said its growth strategy this year included the plannedopening of branches in the Swiss cities of Basel and Berne. Last year Vontobel bought Commerzbank's Swiss arm for anundisclosed sum. Scheidt said the bank would complete its integration ofCommerzbank by the end of the month, and could subsequentlyconsider an acquisition in private banking, although it had noimmediate need to do so. Analysts were more sceptical about the bank's prospects. "With all the M&A activity about to happen in Swiss bankingamongst the smaller players, Vontobel is more likely to be avictim than an aggressor and that prospect should excite someinterest, but as an investment bank the shares are high enough,"said Thorne. Vontobel currently trades at around 12 times consensusearnings for 2010, in line with peer EFG International but at adiscount to larger rival Bank Sarasin ($1=1.080 Swiss Franc) (Editing by Jon Loades-Carter and Rupert Winchester)             ]]></raw>
