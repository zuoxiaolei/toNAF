<raw><![CDATA[  * Demand for yen, Swiss franc stalls * U.S. weekly new jobless claims fall more than expected * Analysts expect economic weakness to underpin safe havens * Traders await Bernanke's speech at Fed gathering (Adds comments, details. Updates prices.) By Vivianne Rodrigues NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - A rally in safe-havencurrencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc stalled onThursday as global equities stabilized and investors braced forFederal Chairman Ben Bernanke's speech on Friday. Rising concerns over the deepening economic slowdown pushedthe yen and Swiss franc to multi-year highs this week due totheir perceived safe-haven status. But investors were reluctant to keep pushing thosecurrencies higher on Thursday ahead of an annual FederalReserve gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming where Bernanke willgive his thoughts on the U.S. economy. For details, see. Demand for the yen cooled amid speculation Bank of JapanGovernor Masaaki Shirakawa might address the currency'sstrength at the retreat. The dollar got some support after agovernment report showed new U.S. claims for unemploymentbenefits fell more that expected last week. Still, analysts such as Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FXstrategy at Deutsche Bank AG, said moves would be limitedbefore Bernanke's speech. "For the currency market, the immediate response has beenrisk positive, best expressed through dollar/yen," Ruskin said.But "given proximity to the Bernanke speech tomorrow, I suspectthere will be a lack of follow-through all round to the data." In midday trading in New York, the dollar was littlechanged at 84.58 yen, while the euro rose 0.2 percent to$1.2690. The yen rose to 15-year high on Tuesday. The euro touched an all-time low versus the Swiss franc onWednesday but after a bounce in European stocks it was littlechanged on Thursday at 1.3053. The single currency alsorebounded versus the yen to trade 0.3 percent higher at 107.40yen after hitting a nine-year low on Tuesday. The euro earlier broke through its 55-day and 100-daymoving averages at $1.2713 and $1.2737 respectively. A closeabove these levels would add to upward momentum. But analysts said better sentiment was unlikely to besustained. "While the euro may enjoy additional near-terms gains, itsupside should prove very limited, especially in an environmentwhere investors are growing increasingly nervous about theglobal economic outlook," said Omer Esiner, chief marketanalyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. FED GATHERING Analysts said the market was well contained on cautionabout possible Japanese intervention, while many investorsremained on the sideline. News that Shirakawa would attend the Jackson Holeconference made some players hesitant to push the yen higher.Speculation has grown Japan may intervene to stem the yen'srise for the first time since March 2004. It hit an all-timehigh of 79.75 to the dollar in 1995. Japan has not been immune to the deep global recession, anda strong yen will dampen demand for Japanese exports,offsetting other measures to stimulate the economy. Suzuki Motor, for example, loses 700 million yen ($8.3million) from its annual operating profit for every one-yenfall in the dollar. Bernanke will speak in Jackson Hole on Friday aboutuncertain prospects for the world's largest economy but may notoffer many clues on whether the U.S. central bank will pumpmore cash to keep the recovery going. "The latest data though erratic week to week, plays to thecamp that the trends in the labor market will not put as muchpressure on the Fed Chairman to display a dovish line(tomorrow)," said Ruskin at Deutsche Bank.
