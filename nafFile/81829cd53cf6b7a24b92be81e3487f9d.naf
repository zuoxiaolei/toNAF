<raw><![CDATA[ MANILA, April 6 (Reuters) - Asia's emerging economies arespearheading a global recovery and the challenge forpolicymakers is to normalise policy to head off inflation andoverheating, the Asian Development Bank said on Wednesday.	 Developing Asia, a diverse group of economies includingChina, India, Azerbaijan, Thailand and Fiji, is expected to grow7.8 percent in 2011 and 7.7 percent in 2012, robust rates albeitslower than the 9 percent seen in 2010.	 Risks to growth included soft job and housing markets in theUnited States, Europe's debt problems, the economic impact oflast month's massive earthquake in Japan and rising commodityprices, which are being stoked by upheavals in North Africa andthe Middle East.	  "The region's outlook, however, is for continued stronggrowth in 2011- 2012, but with the threat of inflation loomingcloser," the ADB said in its Asian Development Outlook report.	 "When weighing their macroeconomic policy choices, many ofdeveloping Asia's policy makers see that the balance has tippedtoward avoiding overheating."	 The ADB, which said its report was generally based on dataavailable up to March 16, said the impact of Japan's disasterwas hard to quantify, but was likely to be temporary andlimited.	 "This benign baseline scenario assumes no major aftershocks,extended power shortages, or massive radiation leaks from theFukushima plant."	  The ADB said there were two important challenges for Asia tosustain growth that would cut poverty: the need to tackle risinginflation and foster new sources of growth.	 "High and volatile oil and food prices will in particularreverberate through the world economy, and they are likely tostay that way in 2011-2012. They will thus be a significantsource of global inflation, especially in developing countrieswhere recovery is firmly under way."	 Asia's strong recovery from the global financial crisis hasseen its central banks raise interest rates to try to steminflationary pressures. On Tuesday, China raised interest ratesfor the fourth time since October.

The share of world merchandise trade among countries in theSouth more than doubled in less than two decades, from 7% in1990 to 17% in 2009, the ADB said.	  INFLATION A POVERTY RISK	 A surge in inflation, particularly food price inflation,could pull down those who are currently just above the povertyline, making it a social as well as economic concern.	 The report said recent estimates showed a 10 percent rise indomestic food prices would raise the number of poor indeveloping Asia by about 64 million, or more than 7 percent.	 "High inflation is a direct threat to stable and inclusivegrowth since rising domestic prices can lead to socialtensions," the ADB said. 	 But tackling inflation driven by global and supply-sidefactors can put policymakers in a difficult position.	 Steps such as tariff cuts and export bans have varyingsuccess, and there could also be problems with infrastructure ordomestic supply chains that exacerbate price pressures. Raising interest rates can attract more foreign inflows,which adds to pressure from currencies to appreciate and createsgreater liquidity in domestic money supply, creating furtherdifficulties.	 Allowing currencies to appreciate was effective when dealingwith a sustained surge of inflows, but could cause problems ifthe inflows are temporary, the ADB said.	 "Unfortunately, distinguishing between permanent andtemporary capital inflows is difficult, so countries will haveto decide on the nature of problem while taking the necessaryactions."
