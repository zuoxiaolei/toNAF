<raw><![CDATA[ * Record trade surplus pumps money into Australia economy * Annual house price growth still running hot at 18 pct * Suggests risks are for further rate rises over time By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Australia's trade surplusballooned to a record in June as export earnings from iron oreand coal surged, lifting the local dollar and acting as areminder of why the next move in interest rates is still likelyto be up. The surplus of A$3.54 billion ($3.2 billion) was almosttwice the market forecast and far outstripped the previousrecord of A$2.5 billion. The surplus for the three months toJune amounted to A$6.6 billion, a turnaround of almost A$10billion from the first quarter's deficit and a boon foreconomic growth. A government measure of city house prices also showed briskgrowth of over 18 percent for the year to June, a worry for theReserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which has been hoping highermortgage rates would cool the red-hot sector. "The trade numbers are just massive," said Su-Lin Ong, asenior economist at RBC Capital Markets. "That's a lot ofincome flowing into the economy and we could well see nominalGDP (gross domestic product) growth in double-digits." "It's also coming while the labour market is already strongand unemployment low," she added. "It means the bias is stillfor higher interest rates down the track." The central bank left rates unchanged at 4.5 percent at itsmonthly policy meeting on Tuesday, and investors are wageringit will stay on hold well into 2011. The market is implying almost no chance of a hike to 4.75percent in September and October and only 15 basis points oftightening in the next 12 months. But with the country's commodity exports benefiting sogreatly from demand in China and India, analysts suspect rateswill have to head higher at some point. "The RBA is unlikely to be on the sidelines for long in aneconomy with 9-10 percent nominal GDP and inflation in theupper half of the target range," said UBS chief economist ScottHaslem. TRADE BONANZA "If the past is any guide, the money from trade willeventually leak into the broader economy via higher investment,jobs growth, wages and dividends," said Haslem. Exports climbed 7.1 percent alone in June, to rise 32percent from the same month last year. In contrast, importsrose just 0.2 percent in June. Iron ore and copper exports jumped 23 percent in the month,while coal rose 15 percent rise in coal and cotton more thandoubled. Contract prices for iron ore and coal have surged thisyear thanks to demand from China and India, where more than 2billion people are industrialising at breakneck pace. As a result Australia's terms of trade, or the ratio ofexport prices to import prices, could rise 20 percent thisyear. The RBA's own index of Australian commodity pricesclimbed 50 percent in the year to July to the second highest onrecord. Export volumes also looked to be higher for the secondquarter, implying trade could make a significant contributionto GDP growth after several quarters of drag. It should also see Australia's perennial current accountdeficit shrink markedly in the quarter, making it lessvulnerable to swings in global financial sentiment. All of this will shower money on the economy at a time whenthe jobless rate is already down to 5.1 percent and nearinglows that have sparked inflation in the past. "It looks like the economy was firing on all cylinders lastquarter," said Adam Carr, a senior economist at ICAP. "Theboost to the terms of trade just shows why Australia is sostrong compared to the rest of the developed world." "It also means the next move in rates is up, the onlyquestion is when."
