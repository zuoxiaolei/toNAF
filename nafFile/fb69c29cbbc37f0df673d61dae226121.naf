<raw><![CDATA[ * Morocco, Algeria harvests in line with forecasts      * Tunisian crop smaller than expected: farm union       * Cereals output in region pushed down by poor weather   ALGIERS, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Grain harvests in Morocco andAlgeria, north Africa's main cereal producers, are broadly inline with forecast declines, while Tunisia's crop is smallerthan predicted, officials and farming groups said. The hot weather which damaged crops in Russia and parts ofWestern Europe, driving international grain prices to two-yearhighs, has not moved south of the Mediterranean, leaving mildconditions for the end of the growing season. The harvest has been gathered in most places in northAfrica, where some countries are among the world's biggest grainimporters. Farming officials have blamed the reduced output versus lastyear on poor weather earlier in the season. Morocco is expected to produce 8 million tonnes of grain,down from last year's 10.2 million, and Algeria's harvest willbe about 4.5 million tonnes, against a record 6.1 million tonneslast year, according to local estimates. The crop in Morocco, the region's biggest producer, will bein line with an Agriculture Ministry forecast made in April, thehead of the country's main farming lobby told Reuters. "The harvest outcome is good, because it came in higher thanthe average of the past five years," said Bouchta Bousouf,chairman of the Moroccan Federation of Farming Chambers. "The quality of the harvest is also good. We can not sayvery good, because the previous harvest was really excellent interms of quality," he said.  CROP BREAKDOWN Moroccan state grain import agency ONICL released figuresforecasting the harvest would comprise 3.8 million tonnes ofsoft wheat, 1.7 million tonnes of durum wheat and 2.5 milliontonnes of barley. However, it was not clear whether those figures were basedon fresh data or on an older forecast. In Algeria, Agriculture Minister Rachid Benaissa gave the4.5 million tonne forecast last month, saying soft wheat andbarley crops would be smaller but the durum wheat harvest wouldbe good. Agriculture Ministry sources earlier told Reuters theharvest would be between 5 million and 5.5 million tonnes.Farming sector sources said irregular rains at the start of theyear and flooding in June affected the size of the crop. Tunisia had been forecasting a cereals harvest of 1.6million tonnes, down from 2.5 million the year before, but MonjiChrif, an official with the Agriculture Union, revised hisprediction down this week to between 1.1 million and 1.2 milliontonnes. He did not cite a reason, but officials previously said poorrains had affected the crop. Libya, which has the region's smallest population, said inJune the harvest was 300,000 tonnes. Libya harvests its cropearlier than Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia because its farmlandlies further south. None of the four countries has so far given any indicationof how they will adjust import schedules after the Russiandrought drove up international prices and interrupted exports ofRussian grain.
