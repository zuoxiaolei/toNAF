<raw><![CDATA[ * Ethical Currency calls for voluntary tax on forex deals * Forex brokers alone cld raise up to 35 bln stg for charity * UK regulator raises sceptre of transaction tax LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - A new British foreign exchangebroker on Thursday urged peers to help raise billions of poundsfor charity as it vowed to donate part of each transaction tofight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Ethical Currency's call comes as UK financial regulatorsraise the spectre of taxing financial transactions to help curbexcessive banker pay, after the near collapse of the globalfinancial industry last October, and G20 finance ministersprepare to meet in London next week. Inspired by the late Nobel prize-winning U.S. economistJames Tobin, who called for a tax on financial flows to pay fordevelopment, Ethical Currency said it would voluntarily donate0.005 percent of all deals to charity. "Ethical Currency has effectively adopted the taxvoluntarily, but the organisation's founders believe that itshould be introduced as a Currency Transaction Levy," saidforeign exchange trader and founder Alastair Constance. "Campaigners have estimated that a tax levied at 0.005percent would raise up to 35 billion pounds ($57 billion) a year-- enough to enable the G7 countries to meet their commitment atthe Gleneagles summit in 2005 to double global aid." Critics of such levies on transactions argue that withoutglobal agreement and coordination, money will simply move toeconomies that do not impose any. "We expect governments to initially face major resistancefrom the financial sector, but over time, it would barely benoticed," said Constance. Ethical Currency is not alone in donating to charity.Activist hedge fund The Children's Investment Fund (TCI), partof an industry that faces widespread criticism for its role inshort-selling banking shares, pay hundreds of millions of poundsto its childrens' charity.
