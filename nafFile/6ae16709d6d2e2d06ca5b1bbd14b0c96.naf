<raw><![CDATA[ TOKYO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Japan's decision to intervene incurrency markets last month reflects tensions in the globalcurrency system, and it is undesirable for this to sparkprotectionism, World Bank President Robert Zoellick said,according to the Nikkei newspaper Zoellick will neither support nor criticise Japan'sintervention, the Nikkei on Thursday quoted him as saying. There is no scientific answer for how much China's yuanshould rise, Zoellick also said in an interview with the Nikkei. U.S. currency policy is best left to U.S. officials, he said. Money flowing to emerging markets from advanced economies inpursuit of higher returns could cause currency appreciation andbubbles, so officials should consider various measures forshort-term capital flows, Zoellick said, according to the Nikkei. The global exchange rate system and rebalancing worldeconomic growth will be an important topic at InternationalMonetary Fund, World Bank and Group of Seven meetings this week.
