<raw><![CDATA[ * Deal would end special treatment for Africa and Caribbean * Lower tariffs for ex-colonies fuelled long-running row * Deal with Latam could unblock trade talks and cut prices   (Adds background, detail) By Timothy Heritage and John O'Donnell STOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - European Union tradenegotiators are within days of a deal to cut tariffs on bananasimported from outside the African and Caribbean regions, notablyfrom Latin America, EU trade commissioner Catherine Ashton said. An agreement, which could come as early as this week, wouldend the world's longest-running trade dispute and bolster theWorld Trade Organisation, whose Doha negotiations to free upglobal commerce have at times been held hostage by the row. "We are in the closing stages of what could be the end ofthis long dispute," Ashton told Reuters on Wednesday on thesidelines of an EU-Russia summit in Stockholm.  "I think it will be later this week or early next week," shesaid, commenting on a resolution of the decades-old dispute withexporters in Latin America, who pay higher tariffs than African,Caribbean and Pacific rivals to sell bananas in Europe. The deal, which should be sealed before the WTO'sministerial conference starting on Nov. 30, would see theEuropean Union steadily cutting tariffs on bananas for suppliersin Latin America and elsewhere. It is likely to reduce prices for consumers, bolsteringcompetition and strengthening the hand of low-cost LatinAmerican exporters. It will help companies like Chiquita andDole, U.S. distributors of the region's bananas. One source close to the matter said, however, that someissues remained to be resolved. "We have to agree what willhappen with regard to the Doha round on tropical fruits," hesaid.  POSITIVE MOMENTUM Reuters reported earlier this month that a deal on thedispute was emerging. As part of the deal, the Latin Americans would dropchallenges to the EU at the WTO. "We are hopeful that anagreement on bananas will give a momentum for a positive resultfor world trade," the source said. Brussels would compensate African, Caribbean and Pacificcountries -- mainly former British, French and Portuguesecolonies -- that lose preferential access to the EU market. The terms are likely to resemble an agreement almost reachedin July last year on the fringes of a meeting of trade ministersseeking a breakthrough on the Doha talks. That banana agreement was linked to a broader Doha deal inagriculture and when the July meeting collapsed, the EuropeanUnion walked away. Under that arrangement, the EU would have cut the tariff onbananas to $114 a tonne by 2016, from $176, with an initial cutto $148. (Editing by Anthony Barker)             ]]></raw>
