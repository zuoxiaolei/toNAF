<raw><![CDATA[ * Kirk to discuss new enforcement initiative in Pittsburgh * Obama WTO case filings fall short of campaign rhetoric By Doug Palmer WASHINGTON, July 29 (Reuters) - During the heat of the 2008presidential campaign, Democrats vowed to make enforcement ofU.S. trade agreements a top priority if President Barack Obamawon the White House. Now, with Democrats' grasp on Congresslooking shaky, they are sounding the same note. U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk will visit Pittsburgh onFriday to give a speech on Obama's trade enforcement agenda. The spotlight on making sure other countries "play by therules" follows Obama's decision to push ahead with free tradeagreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama that manyDemocratic voters in union-heavy states oppose. With many Americans generally frustrated and angry withWashington, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll this week found 72percent of Republicans certain that they will vote in Novembercompared to 49 percent of Democrats. Kirk's office said he would discuss "a new step the Obamaadministration will take on trade enforcement this year," buthas given few details. Kirk himself provided only a teaser at aroundtable with reporters on Wednesday. "Come to Pittsburgh and you'll get more," he said after onereporter joked that all Kirk does is talk about "negotiation,negotiation" instead of taking action, such as filing new casesat the World Trade Organization. But in the same news conference, Kirk also made clear hisdislike for WTO litigation, which can take years to resolve andoften produce mixed results. "My guiding principle is that where we can get issuesresolved through direct negotiations, no matter how difficultthey are, we're so much better served than saying 'I'm going togo to the WTO and file a case'," Kirk said. "Because part of my concern was the number of matters wehave with trade partners that have been at the WTO five years,10 years, 20 years. Because at that point, you've got a war ofwills between lawyers who are each concerned they're right." In keeping with that philosophy, Kirk has filed just twoWTO cases -- one against excise taxes the Philippines imposeson imported liquor and another in conjunction with the EuropeanUnion against China's export restraints on raw materials usedin the production of steel. TRADE RULES ENFORCEMENT U.S. trade officials argue enforcement is about more thangoing to the WTO and that they have been aggressive on otherfronts, ranging from Obama's decision to slap tariffs on tiresfrom China to settling disputes with the European Union overbeef and with Israel over intellectual property rights. Still, Kirk's aversion to WTO litigation is at odds withcomplaints Democrats made against former President George W.Bush during his eight years in office. Lael Brainard, now U.S. Treasury under secretary forinternational affairs, accused Bush in 2008 of lax enforcementbecause the number of WTO cases brought by the United Statesfell during his two terms to about three per year compared to11 annually under Democrat Bill Clinton. Based on growth in world trade and the rise in the numberof WTO members, "you would have expected 17 cases per year" ifthe Bush administration was serious about enforcement, saidBrainard, who served in the Clinton White House. Both Republicans and Democrats have repeatedly urged Kirkto file a case against China's currency policy at the WTO, sofar to no avail. They argue China's yuan is so undervalued iteffectively "frustrates" trade liberalization commitmentsBeijing made when it joined the world trade body. Senators pressed Kirk on the issue at his confirmationhearing, and more than a year later his office has yet to givea definitive answer on whether it thinks a case is possible. Many WTO experts, however, consider it a long shot andthink it would be risky for the United States to launch such achallenge given vague WTO language on the issue.
