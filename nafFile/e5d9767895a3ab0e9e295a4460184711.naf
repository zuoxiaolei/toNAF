<raw><![CDATA[ * Oct freight up 14.4 percent, passenger demand up 10.1percent y/y * Freight growth steadies after slowing  (Adds details) GENEVA, Nov 25 (Reuters) - International air cargo trafficpicked up in October after falling since May to stand 14.4percent higher than a year earlier, the airline industry bodyIATA said on Thursday. October's year-on-year increase in air freight -- animportant indicator of trade and economic recovery -- was belowSeptember's 15.5 percent rise but the monthly rise followed a 5percent fall since May, the International Air TransportAssociation said in its monthly analysis of air traffic. "Freight appears to be at a turning point," IATA said. "But a single month does not make a trend. And it remains tobe seen if this is the stabilisation in freight volumes or thestart of an upward trend," its director-general, GiovanniBisignani, added in a statement. Freight traffic, which accounts for 35 percent of the valueof goods traded internationally, is now 1 percent abovepre-crisis levels of early 2008, IATA said. Passenger demand -- a reflection of business and consumerconfidence -- was 10.1 percent higher in October than a yearearlier, slightly below September's 10.7 percent rise, and isnow 5 percent above pre-crisis levels. IATA said airlines were reacting to this year's rebound indemand with cautious increases in capacity. In the first 10 months of this year an 8.5 percent increasein passenger demand was matched by a 4.0 percent increase incapacity, while a 24 percent increase in freight demand led toonly a 9.2 percent rise in cargo capacity. Airlines are planning a further 7.5 percent increase inpassenger capacity for the half-year scheduling period beginningat the end of October, said IATA, which represents 230 airlinesincluding Aeroflot, Air China and Lan Airlines. Passenger growth in October was strongest among MiddleEastern airlines and weakest in Latin America.
