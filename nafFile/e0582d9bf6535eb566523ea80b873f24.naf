<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was steady against its Canadian counterpart in light trade on Monday, after the release of upbeat housing starts data out of Canada, while the greenback remained supported after Friday's U.S. employment report.  USD/CAD hit 1.0224 during early U.S. trade, the session high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.0198, inching up 0.01%.  The pair was likely to find support at 1.0150, the low of May 16 and resistance at 1.0259, the high of April 15.  Official data showed that housing starts in Canada rose by 200,200 units in May, beating expectations for a 178,000 increase, after a 175,900 rise the previous month.  Meanwhile, the greenback remained supported after official data on Friday showed that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs last month, slightly more than the 170,000 gain forecast by economists. The unemployment rate ticked up to 7.6% from 7.5% in April.The data indicated that the economic recovery in the U.S is on track but is not strong enough for the Federal Reserve to begin unwinding its USD85 billion-a-month asset purchase program.  The loonie was higher against the euro with EUR/CAD shedding 0.24%, to hit 1.3451. Also Monday, the Sentix investor confidence index for the euro zone improved to minus 11.6 in June, from a reading of minus 15.6 the previous month, compared to expectations for an improvement to minus 10.0.             ]]></raw>
