<raw><![CDATA[ * CDC to send 1.2 mln doses to NYC in first batch * Up to 1 mln New Yorkers may be affected in spring(Adds details from news conference) By Edith Honan NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - All primary school-agechildren in New York City will be offered free vaccines forseasonal and H1N1 flu this year under a plan announced onTuesday by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The vaccines are part of the city's strategy to combat thenew H1N1 swine flu strain that hit the city hard during thespring, infecting an estimated 750,000 to 1 million people orabout 10 percent of the population. "We've looked at every eventuality we thought was somewhatprobable and have planned for it. Hopefully, we won't have touse any of it," Bloomberg told reporters. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasurged state and local health departments to prepare vaccinationplans ahead of an expected second wave of H1N1 as the northernhemisphere enters the fall and winter months. Safety tests are being done on a vaccine for H1N1 and it isexpected to be made available in the second half of October,according to the CDC. The CDC is expected to send 1.2 million vaccine doses tothe city by mid-October and an additional 500,000 doses everyweek thereafter and also to cover the $30 million cost,Bloomberg said. Five companies are making swine flu vaccine for the U.S.market -- AstraZeneca's MedImmune unit, CSL Ltd,GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Novartis AG and Sanofi-Aventis SA. New York's plan calls for distributing both conventionalshots and MedImmune's FluMist, which is sprayed in the nose. H1N1 has killed at least 2,185 people globally since itbegan quickly spreading among humans earlier this year,according to the World Health Organization. Because this virus is new, more people are susceptible toit and the WHO has been predicting for months now that 2billion people will likely become infected. White House advisers warned on Aug. 24 that it could infectup to half the U.S. population, leading to as many as 1.8million hospitalizations and 90,000 deaths -- more than doublethe number of fatalities seen in a typical flu season. Swine flu disproportionately affects younger people, unlikeseasonal flu which mainly burdens the elderly. New York City's vaccination plan calls for each primaryschool in the city to hold two vaccination sessions, about fourweeks apart, Bloomberg said. Older students can report to a flucenter in each of the city's five boroughs. The city will also turn some health clinics intospecialized flu treatment centers, launch a web portal to trackflu data, and dispatch hundreds of volunteer "flu fighters" tosenior centers, schools and houses of worship. The strategy was developed by experts from 15 city agencieswho met throughout the summer. (Editing by Daniel Trotta and Paul Simao)             ]]></raw>
