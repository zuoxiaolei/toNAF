<raw><![CDATA[  * European bank stress tests show 8 failures out of 90 * U.S. consumer sentiment worsens in July * Swiss franc seen good hedge vs euro, dollar (Updates prices, adds quotes and graphics, changes byline) By Julie Haviv NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - The euro traded unchangedagainst the dollar on Friday as investors shrugged offEuropean bank stress-test results and remained focused oncontagion risks of peripheral debt. Europe's banks grabbed the spotlight in the afternoon whenthe European Banking Authority released its widely anticipatedstress-test results, showing eight banks failed a test oftheir ability to withstand a prolonged recession. For story[ID:nL6E7IF19G] [ID:nBANKTESTS] The stress test made on 90 lenders came in slightly belowexpectations that around 10 to 15 lenders would fail."To be honest, I am pretty skeptical of the results andfind it hard to believe that only 8 failed," said Omer Esiner,chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange inWashington. "Furthermore, the assumptions used are not as realistic asthey could have been, and they did not discount for haircutson Greece or other sovereign debt." In early afternoon New York trading, the euro  wasnearly unchanged at $1.4146, still above a four-month low of$1.38376  hit this week when fears of contagion risksfears were running high. The more investors fear that heavily indebted euro-zonegovernments will be unable to repay their debts, the more theyields on their bonds rise, dragging down their value inbanks' balance sheets, erasing their capital, and increasingthe need for yet more bank bailouts by stronger euro-zonegovernments. Euro zone debt crisis:         http://r.reuters.com/hyb65p  TAKE A LOOK: European bank stress tests[ID:nL6E7IE0W0]    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> An unexpected contraction in a New York statemanufacturing index in July and a drop in U.S. consumersentiment had earlier boosted the safe-haven greenback. For awrap-up of U.S. economic data, see [ID:nN1E76E0B9]. The ICE dollar index  was last down 0.1 percent at75.147. The core reading of the U.S. Consumer Price Index forJune was up 0.3 percent, higher than forecast, but that didnot hurt the dollar. The data suggested another round ofFederal Reserve quantitative easing was not imminent. The impasse on the U.S. debt ceiling talks should remain aheadwind for the U.S. dollar. Standard & Poor's earlier saidthere was a one-in-two chance it could cut the United States'credit ratings if no deal was reached on raising thegovernment's debt ceiling. [ID:nL3E7IF03A] The euro's outlook was also shaky on worries about whetherEurope could find a solution to the debt crisis in Greece andprevent contagion to larger countries such as Italy,highlighted by the rising cost of insuring peripheral euro-zone debt against default. [GVD/EUR] With prospects for both the euro and dollar muddied bymajor concerns about debt in the euro zone and the UnitedStates, some analysts recommended buying the safe-haven Swissfranc as a hedge against risks to both the euro and thedollar. Implied volatility in euro/Swiss one-month implied vols rose higher than Aussie/dollar one-month impliedvols  for the first time, which analysts saidreflected a continued search for safer alternatives as theeuro zone's debt crisis rages. Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD Securitiesin Toronto, favored buying the Swedish krona against the euro.The euro was nearly unchanged at 9.1948 krona . "The outlook for higher rates, large current accountsurpluses, firm growth and local tolerance for (krona)appreciation suggest that its recent slump versus the euroshould start to reverse."
