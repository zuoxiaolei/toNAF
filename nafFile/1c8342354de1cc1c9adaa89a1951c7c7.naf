<raw><![CDATA[ * Says subsidies give "significant advantage" * Airbus parent EADS says competing daily * Pentagon has resisted pressure to factor in WTO dispute (Adds EADS response, further detail on contest, WTO dispute) By Jim Wolf WASHINGTON, April 22 (Reuters) - Boeing Co's  chiefexecutive said government subsidies received by archrivalAirbus give the European aircraft builder a "significantadvantage" in their rematch for a potential $50 billon U.S. AirForce aerial-refueling fleet contract. Two days after Airbus parent EADS  said it wouldcompete for the deal, James McNerney said on Thursday thatBoeing was very concerned about the subsidies' impact in afixed-price development competition for an initial 179 tankeraircraft. "We're not afraid of global competition," he said at theWoodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. "We just wantlevel-playing-field rules applied in a common sense way." In a fixed-price deal, a contractor must bear any costoverruns rather than pass them along to the government. McNerney made his remarks in response to a question afterdelivering a speech on U.S. global competitiveness, innovationand approaches to public-private cooperation. President Barack Obama tapped McNerney last month to chairthe President's Export Council, the principal national advisorycommittee on international trade. McNerney referred to a World Trade Organization ruling lastmonth that Airbus had benefited from illegal subsidies,including to develop the A330, the plane it is pitting againsta modified Boeing 767 in the Air Force rematch. "In a fixed-price development competition, that subsidy isa significant advantage," he said. The tankers are used to refuel other aircraft in mid-air.They would replace Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers that averageabout 50 year old. The Airbus-Boeing subsidy dispute goes back decades. A WTOpanel is to rule in coming months on a European Union challengeto allegedly WTO-incompatible U.S. federal, state and localsubsidies benefiting Boeing. The U.S. Defense Department has resisted pressure fromBoeing's political backers in Congress to factor the WTO rulingagainst Airbus into the tanker competition. "My lawyers tell me that the WTO case gives us no basis onwhich to make a judgment," Defense Secretary Robert Gates tolda House of Representatives Appropriations defense subcommitteeon March 24. Guy Hicks, a spokesman for EADS' North American arm, saidin response to McNerney that Boeing and EADS compete on theglobal stage daily in "highly competitive, price-basedselections." The tanker competition "is essentially the same dynamic ofoffering the greatest capability at an appropriate price," hesaid in an email. "Competition has proven time and time againto substantially benefit both military and commercialcustomers." EADS said Tuesday it would bid against Boeing for thecontract, acting as its own prime contractor. Final bids aredue July 9. EADS partnered with Northrop Grumman Corp  to win asimilar contest in 2008, only to have its award overturnedafter Boeing lodged a formal protest with the U.S. GovernmentAccountability Office. Auditors found the Air Force had failedto follow its own judging rules. Northrop withdrew last month. Wes Bush, its chiefexecutive, said the Pentagon's final tender "clearly favors"Boeing's smaller 767-based tanker. The Air Force initially tried to lease and buy modifiedBoeing 767s as tankers in a $23.5 billion deal rooted in thepost-September 11, 2001, commercial aviation downturn. Thatdeal collapsed amid a conflict-of-interest scandal that senttwo Boeing executives to prison, one of them the Air Force'sformer No. 2 weapons buyer.
