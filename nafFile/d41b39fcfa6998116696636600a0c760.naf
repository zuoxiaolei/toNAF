<raw><![CDATA[ * Liquidation of cross/yen long-position runs its course * Impact from China tightening move likely waning * Long Aussie positions cut but impact seen limited By Kaori Kaneko TOKYO, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The yen paused in its gains onWednesday after investor closing of long positions in the likesof the dollar, euro and higher yielding currencies appeared tohave run its course and the focus shifted to U.S. companyearnings. China's central bank surprised world markets on Tuesday bytaking a step toward tighter policy, lifting the Japanesecurrency while commodity currencies such as the Australian andthe New Zealand dollars slipped as investors unwound short-yenpositions. But yen crosses stabilised on Wednesday after losses inShanghai's share market from the tightening seemed to containedand investors judged that the move would not derail China'sgrowth, traders said. "Yesterday's fall in yen crosses was nothing more than weoften see when these volatile rates are in a correction phase. Idon't expect that to spark a series of loss-cutting selling ofother currencies against the yen," said Hideki Hayashi, a globaleconomist at Mizuho Securities. The dollar was hovering around 91.08 yen, having lost morethan 1 percent on Tuesday to as low as 90.73 yen. Technically a break of the 91.25/90.75 yen support zonemeant there was an increased risk of additional retracement forthe dollar. The next line of support was seen around the90.36/90.00 yen area, which includes a 38.2 percent retracementfrom its November low. China's surprise move on Tuesday to raise bank reserverequirements led investors to cut sizeable long positions in theAustralian dollar. Many investors had been borrowing in yen to buy a range ofassets leveraged to Chinese and global growth. Adding to the negative tone for risk trades and high-yieldingcurrencies on Tuesday was a weak start to the U.S. earningsseason. Alcoa Inc's opened the U.S. earnings seasonwith results that missed forecasts while Chevron Corpissued a profit warning. That combined with concerns about apotential U.S. government levy on banks to hit stocks. Some traders said there might be a little more room to fallin dollar/yen and cross/yen in the wake of China's step. But themarket was not minded to use the Chinese move on Tuesday as amain trading factor, said a trader at a Japanese bank. "Since more earnings from U.S. major corporations will bereleased, players will be watching how they affect U.S. shareprices and Treasury yields," he said. The dollar index, which measures the value of the greenbackagainst a basket of currencies, edged up 0.1 percent to 77.063,off a four-week low of 76.758 touched on Tuesday. The euro was little changed at 131.71 yen, having fallen 1.4percent on Tuesday with support seen around the 131.20 yen area. The Australian dollar rose 0.3 percent to 83.93 yen, havingregistered its biggest daily drop in eight weeks on the Chinanews. Support is seen around the 83.00/20 yen level, traderssaid. Mizuho Securities' Hayashi said investors find the Australiandollar attractive at below 84 yen so the currency is unlikely toextend its slide from the current level. "There has been no change in the tightening stance ofAustralia's central bank. That will keep lending the Aussiesupport," he said. The Aussie held just above $0.9200, after it fellmore than 1.2 percent on Tuesday, with investors cutting longpositions on the slide. The euro was at $1.4476, getting some support from commentsby Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou. Worries about Greece's financial situation have weighed onthe euro in recent weeks. But Papaconstantinou told aGerman newspaper on Tuesday that Greece had no more skeletonsin the closet, and had a solid basis for cutting its deficit.
