<raw><![CDATA[ * New govt wage offer unlikely to come on Friday * Investors worry about strike stretching into Sept. * Deal reached in auto workers' strike  (Adds deal reached in auto strike) By Jon Herskovitz JOHANNESBURG, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Unions representingstriking South African civil servants plan talks with thegovernment on Friday as investors worry about the damage of aprolonged walk-out on Africa's largest economy. The strike by more than 1 million state workers seekinghigher wages started on Wednesday -- the latest in a wave oflabour protests to hit the country since May. The latest strike turned violent on its second day withpolice firing rubber bullets to disperse protesters blockingbusy roads and preventing patients from entering hospitals. Any agreement will likely swell state spending by about 1 to2 percent, forcing the government to find funds to pay for thedeal as it tries to bring its deficit down from 6.7 percent ofgross domestic product. Chris Klopper, a spokesman for the Independent Labour Caucusunion federation, expects the government to repeat a threat tounilaterally impose its wage raise offer and not to bring anynew deal to the table. "Hopefully the discussions will be more positive than that,"he said. The public sector strike is likely to stretch into next weekbut analysts see a deal coming before September, which wouldlimit the damage of the walk-out by police, teachers, healthcareworkers, customs officers and government clerks. Traders say the strike has not hit daily activity in therand or bonds but they are worried about a labour stoppage thatextends into September. "It just slows down business in general because lots ofbusinesses rely on state entities to get their funds," said Ionde Vleeschauwer, chief dealer at Bidvest Bank. "It might not be evident now, but a couple of months downthe line we will see the effect of the slowdown in economicactivity affecting us," he said. Autoworkers and car manufacturers on Friday reached a wagedeal to end an eight-day strike which led to lost production ofabout 17,000 vehicles, employers body AMEO said. Around half of South Africa's annual production of vehiclesis exported to other African states, Europe and North America. The Automobile Manufacturers Employers Organisation said itand union Numsa signed a 3-year wage agreement which will seeworkers getting a 10 percent increase this year, and 9 percentin each of the next two years. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Friday he did notsee even a protracted strike as having a major economic impact. Unions are demanding an 8.6 percent pay rise, more thandouble the inflation rate, and 1,000 rand ($137) a month forhousing. Last week the government raised the housing allowance to 700rand from a previous offer of 630 rand, but refused to increaseits wage rise offer of 7 percent. Annual inflation now stands at4.2 percent. The housing allowance alone would be equal to about 1percent of all budget spending and the government has said itdoes not have the money to pay more. The unions have taken hits in public opinion after hospitalmanagers attributed several deaths at clinics to the strike anddomestic media reported a man with a severed hand being refusedtreatment at public hospitals because there was no one who couldcare for him.
