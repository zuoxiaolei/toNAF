<raw><![CDATA[ * Risk appetite improves on recovery hopes, earnings * Euro gains on euro zone PMI, German Ifo data * Sterling stumbles on weak UK GDP figures (Adds quotes, updates prices, changes byline) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against theeuro on Friday as figures showing a stabilizing euro zoneeconomy and a good week for the U.S. stock market eroded demandfor the greenback as a safe haven. Higher-yielding, commodity-based currencies such as theAustralian and New Zealand dollars rose as investors took onmore risk. But sterling, which typically benefits from higherrisk appetite, fell after data showed the UK economy contractedfar more than expected in the second quarter. Solid corporate earnings and U.S. housing data have boostedoptimism about the economy this week and sparked a rally inU.S. stocks, which took the Dow industrials above the 9,000level for the first time since early January on Thursday. "Overall, this was a very good week for sentiment," saidRonald Simpson, managing director of global currency analysisat Action Economics in Tampa, Florida. "It looks like the equity market is going to hold virtuallyall of its gains going into the weekend. So that's been keepingpressure on the dollar." In afternoon trading in New York, the euro rose 0.5 percentto $1.4226, after climbing as high as $1.4253, near aseven-week high of $1.4291 hit on Thursday, according toReuters data. The euro got a lift after the Ifo German business sentimentindex rose for a fourth month running to its highest levelsince October 2008, while initial estimates showed the eurozone services and manufacturing sectors contracted much lesssharply than expected in July. "We had the better economic data out of Europe, so we'reseeing positive fundamentals overall. That's helping the euroagainst the dollar and supporting risk sentiment overall," saidBrian Kim, currency strategist at UBS in Stamford,Connecticut. SOLID EARNINGS The ICE Futures' dollar index, which tracks the greenbackversus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.1 percent to 78.740.The dollar fell 0.3 percent against the yen to 94.75. While some companies such as Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com have posted disappointing results, earnings for the quarteroverall have been positive, which has reduced safe-haven demandfor the dollar, analysts said. According to data by Thomson Reuters, of the 184 companiesin the S&P 500 that have reported, 77 percent have beatanalysts' estimates. "There's going to be further downside pressure on the U.S.dollar," said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist atthe Bank of New York Mellon in New York. "We expect euro/dollarto set new highs next week outside of any surprisingly negativedevelopments on the corporate earnings front." A drop in the U.S. consumer confidence index in late Julyto its lowest reading since April slightly dented risksentiment, but the general mood remained upbeat, analystssaid. Sterling fell after official data showed UK gross domesticproduct fell 0.8 percent in the three months to June and was5.6 percent lower on the year, the steepest yearly fall sincesimilar records began in 1955. That was worse than forecastsfor a quarterly decline of 0.3 percent. Sterling fell 0.3 percent to $1.6441, retreating from theday's high of $1.6542, while the euro traded 0.8 percent higherat 86.52 pence.
