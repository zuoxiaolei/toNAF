<raw><![CDATA[ * Oil soars on Libya unrest, hitting airline stocks * Gold jumps as safe haven before falling back * Korean construction stocks hit by Libya * U.S. Treasuries, JGB futures jump By Nick Macfie	 SINGAPORE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped and Asiastock prices fell on Tuesday as investors took fright at theunfolding crisis in Libya and turned to safe havens such asgovernment bonds and gold, pushing the precious metal briefly toa seven-week high.	 U.S. crude futures hit a 2-1/2 year high on concernthat violence in Libya could cut more of the OPEC-member'soutput and that a similar story could play out in other top oilproducers in North Africa and the Middle East. 	Brent crude for April delivery rose $1.42 cents to$107.16 a barrel by 0451 GMT, after rising as high as $108.18 inearly trade. On Monday, Brent hit a 2-1/2 year high of $108.70. 	 "The market is very nervous over news of violence in Libya,"said Yinxi Yu, a commodities analyst with Barclays Capital.	 Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed down 1.8 percent andthe MSCI's index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan was also off about 1.8 percent . 	 Airline stocks tumbled across the region on theback of rising oil prices. Korean Air Line Co Ltd led losers, dropping more than 9 percent. Hong Kong's CathayPacific Airways Ltd fell more than 4 percent to asix-month low.	 Major South Korean builders also slid as they put theirLibya construction projects on hold. Hyundai E&C shares tumbledmore than 9 percent, while Daewoo Engineering & Construction fell 6.3 percent.	 Moody's Investors Service changed the outlook on Japan's Aa2sovereign rating to negative from stable, warning thatgovernment policies may not be enough to rein in public debt.	 "The market is not reacting much to the decision," saidTakeshi Shibasaki, chief financial analyst at Mizuho Securities."Standard and Poor's has already cut Japan's rating, andseparately there already were expectations among participantsthat Moody's would do something."	 Gold, a traditional refuge in times of tumult, extendedgains and rose to its highest in seven weeks, lifting silver toits strongest level since 1980. 	 Spot gold rose $3.75 to $1,409.70 an ounce, but soondrifted back into negative territory. Silver jumped above$34 an ounce, its highest since 1980, before also falling backto around $33.33.	  MOUNTING REVOLT	 European stocks lost more than 1 percent on Monday on a  combination of fears over Libya, where Muammar Gaddafi faced amounting revolt against his 41-year rule, signs of imminentinterest rate rises and more evidence of a poor earnings season.	 U.S. markets were closed Monday for a holiday but U.S. stockfutures were sharply lower, suggesting Wall Street willlikely fall when they reopen on Tuesday.	 "There are a lot of people in the marketplace waiting to getin at better levels," said Todd Martin, Asia equity strategistwith Societe Generale in Hong Kong.	 "Could we be in for a mid-cycle correction? Absolutely, butfrom what we are seeing -- loose monetary policy andimprovements in Europe -- I don't see outrageously overconfidentmarket participants yet. We are in the middle of a bull market.We are getting a proper correction here but long-only money willbe buying into this," he said.	    In Asia, Martin recommended clients shifting more intoequity markets in Japan, Korea and Taiwan, all of which he saidwere attractively valued.	The dollar climbed 0.5 percent against a basket of majorcurrencies to 78.107 on the Libya violence. 	 One of the sharpest moves was in the New Zealand dollar,which slid 1.5 percent to $0.7523 after a strong quakehit New Zealand's second-biggest city of Christchurch.  Libyan forces loyal to Gaddafi, the world'ssecond-longest-serving leader after the Sultan of Brunei, havefought an increasingly bloody battle to keep him in power withresidents reporting gunfire in parts of the capital Tripoli andone political activist saying warplanes had bombed the city. 	Security forces had killed dozens of protesters across thecountry, human rights groups and witnesses said, promptingwidespread condemnation from world leaders.	 U.S. Treasuries jumped in Asia, with the yield on the10-year benchmark falling 7 basis points to 3.515 percent, andJapanese government bonds also rose, with 10-year futures up more than half a point.  	 The Christchurch quake killed at least 65 people, thecountry's prime minister said. New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50index was down 0.67 percent.
