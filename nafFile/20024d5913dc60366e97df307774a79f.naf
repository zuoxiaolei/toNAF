<raw><![CDATA[ * Swiss franc underpinned by Middle East tensions * Dollar index breaks below channel support * Dollar/yen subdued after failing to break 84.00 * Aussie upside seen limited after hitting top-end of range By Ian Chua and Hideyuki Sano SYDNEY/TOKYO, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc held neartwo-week highs on Friday, having powered higher on mountingMiddle East tensions, while the U.S. dollar lost steam, puttingits rebound this month from a three-month low at risk. The Swiss currency, traditionally sought in times ofheightened geopolitical tension, stayed near two-week highsversus the dollar and euro as unrest spread across the MiddleEast and North Africa. Anti-government protesters from Bahrain to Iran were hopingto emulate those who toppled veteran leaders in Egypt andTunisia. [ID:nLDE71G28W] The dollar stood at 0.9505 francs , having fallen aslow as 0.9474 francs on Thursday, its lowest in about two weeks,while the euro fetched 1.2922 francs , having plumbed1.2890 francs on Thursday, also a two-week low. The dollar was also broadly weaker against a basket of majorcurrencies as U.S. bond yields declined slightly and expectationsof a Federal Reserve rate hike failed to gain momentum. A surprisingly large increase in initial jobless claimssignalled wages were unlikely to pick up any time soon, reducingexpectations of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year. The dollar index , which tracks the greenback's performanceagainst a basket of major currencies, dipped to a one-week low of77.921 before edging back to 78.001 . It has broken below a channel support line connecting itsthree-month low on Feb. 2 and lows on Feb. 9-10, suggesting itsrecovery from the Feb 2. low is at risk. Immediate support comes in at 77.88, the 50 percentretracement of the Feb. 2 to Feb. 14 rise, a break of which couldopen the way for a test of the Feb 2. low of 76.881. LITTLE FROM G20? "As long as the dollar index holds above the Feb 2. low, itwill be in a holding pattern," said Ayako Sera, market strategistat Sumitomo Trust and Banking, adding that the dollar's fatehinges on Fed policy in the long run. The Fed's chief, Ben Bernanke, will be speaking in Paris at1300 GMT on Friday ahead of a meeting of G20 finance ministersand central bankers on Friday and Saturday. Traders expect little from the G20 meeting. "I don't think the upcoming G20 meeting will produce manymarket-moving factors, so currencies are expected to stay incurrent ranges," said Masanari Takada, foreign exchangestrategist at Nomura Securities. The euro touched a one-week high of $1.3629 . "You could attribute some of the euro's gains to lower U.S.yields," said a trader at a Japanese bank, "But objectively speaking, it's difficult to justify theeuro's spike as there aren't too many supportive factors for thecurrency at the moment. Some players were squaring positionsahead of the U.S. three-day weekend," he added. The dollar also lost momentum against the yen. The greenbacktraded at 83.35 yen , having fallen to 83.15 on Thursday,well off an eight-week high near 84 yen hit on Wednesday. Traders said heavy offers from Japanese exporters as well asrepatriation of earnings by Japanese companies ahead of theirfinancial year-end next month could block the dollar in the 84-85yen area. But some speculators and leveraged funds are still caught inyen long positions and if they unwind those positions that couldhelp the dollar break through those resistance levels, said OsamuTakashima, chief Japan FX strategist at Citibank. Broad weakness in the dollar and ongoing strength incommodity prices helped to keep the Aussie near a one-week high.It traded at $1.0125 , near Thursday's one-week high of$1.0131. But some market players are concerned that the currency is infor a correction after a strong rally since the middle of lastyear. "The market was well short the Aussie with less liquidity inNew York ahead of the long weekend. But now that we're at thehigh end of the range, I'd look to play from the short side," atrader at a U.S. investment bank said. Recent U.S. data showed long Australian dollar positions have jumped to the highest level since April 2010.[IMM/FX] Back then, the Aussie traded sideways for much of the monthbut subsequently fell more than 12 percent and touched its lowestlevel of the year in May. Some market players think a lot of good news is baked intothe current exchange rate and the weight of positions may startto impact the currency.
