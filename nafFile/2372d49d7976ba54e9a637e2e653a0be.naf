Concerns about further tightening by Chinese monetaryauthorities also stoked worries about a global recovery,denting investors' appetite for risk and drivinghigher-yielding currencies like the Australian dollar lower.

"Only time will tell if the Greeks will be successful intheir efforts to refinance their debts," he added. "Until someother event or crisis draws (currency speculators') attention,the euro will continue to be fairly volatile." In afternoon trading, the euro  was down 0.7 percentat $1.3667, retreating from a four-week high just shy of$1.3800 hit on Friday. Traders said there were reports in the market of largeoption-related sell orders on the approach to $1.3800, limitingany upside momentum on the euro. The ICE Futures' dollar index  traded up 0.5 percentagainst a basket of currencies at 80.261 as weakness in globalstock markets boosted demand for the safe-haven greenback.

FED MEETING LOOMS Investors also stayed cautious ahead of monetary policymeetings by the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan this week. The U.S. central bank is expected to reiterate its pledgeto keep interest rates very low for an "extended period" at theend of its meeting on Tuesday, but market participants willclosely watch the number of dissenters. Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig dissented at theFed's last meeting, saying conditions had improved sufficientlyto warrant dropping the "extended period" phrase. "There's clearly a growing debate within the Fed as to howlong that language should be maintained," said Fergal Smith,managing market strategist, Canada at Action Economics inToronto. If another Fed official dissented or the accompanyingstatement showed a "more hawkish or less dovish" slant, thedollar could benefit, he added. Against the yen , the dollar fell 0.1 percent to90.34 yen. Sterling was the day's biggest mover, falling nearly 1.0percent against the dollar  to $1.5039 after hittingsession lows of $1.5019 on persistent worries about a weak UKeconomic outlook and on uncertainty ahead of a general electionexpected in May. [GBP/] The Bank of Japan starts a two-day meeting on Tuesday atwhich, sources said, it is leaning towards easing monetarypolicy again.
