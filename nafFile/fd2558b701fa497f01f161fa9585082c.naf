<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar demand seen strong from Japanese funds * U.S. Treasuries firm on extended Fed rate pause bets * Silver takes a beating, pulling down gold and oil * Nikkei down about 1 percent, KOSPI hovers below recordhigh By Saikat Chatterjee	 HONG KONG, April 26 (Reuters) - Silver tumbled on Tuesdayand Asian shares pulled back from recent three-year highs in about of profit-taking before the Federal Reserve meeting thisweek where investors are seeking clues on when it plans to beginexisting its ultra-easy monetary policy. 	  The drop in silver, triggered by an options expiry later inthe day, spread to the gold and oil markets with U.S. crudefutures dropping more than a $1 after Saudi Aramco's chiefexecutive said the kingdom was not comfortable with current oilprices. [ID:nL3E7FQ09J]	  "There is some risk reduction because the market wants towatch if Bernanke will say anything about a change of stance,"said Tetsu Emori, a Tokyo-based commodities fund manager atAstmax Investments.	 "Any change of stance is highly unlikely."  	 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will hold the first newsconference ever by a Fed chief after the two-day policycommittee meeting ends on Wednesday.	 The euro also slipped after European Central BankGovernor Jean-Claude Trichet said that a strong dollar is in theinterest of United States, though the prospects of wideninginterest rate differentials between the Fed and the ECB maycheck losses for the single currency.[ID:nEBE7DA00T]	 Equity markets across the region were in the red withJapan's Nikkei ending down more than 1 percent. Sharesoutside Japan , which last week hit their highestlevel since early 2008, were down about 0.8 percent.	 European shares were set to start weaker, tracking falls onWall Street and in Asia, with key indices set to open 0.3-0.5percent lower. [ID:nLDE73K1C7]       	 Credit markets, too, reflected the overall cautioussentiment with credit spreads widening slightly as the broadermarket was wary of a heavy pipeline after a recent flood ofissuances.	 Issuance of dollar-, euro- and yen-denominated bonds fromAsia ex-Japan have already exceeded $30 billion year-to-date,clearly ahead of the pace set in 2010, which saw record issuanceof more than $83 billion.	  AND THE WINNER THIS MONTH IS..	 South Korea's KOSPI dipped 0.4 percent after hittingyet another record high earlier, though it is set to outperformregional indices in a big way this month.	 The KOSPI's near 5 percent rise in April has been led byautomakers and chipmakers with the former benefiting from theproduction hit suffered by Japanese competitors in the wake oflast month's earthquake and tsunami and the latter getting aboost from strong earnings by Intel and Apple.	 While the broader market appeared overbought on sometechnical indicators, automakers offered attractive valuations,with Hyundai Motor shares trading at 10 times its 12-monthforward price earnings multiples, compared with Toyota's around 21, according to Starmine data.      	  EXTENDED PAUSE	 In currency markets, the greenback came under a bit ofselling pressure versus the yen in early trade but losseswere limited on expected dollar demand from Japanese assetmanagement firms as a number of investment trusts, or toushin,are due to be launched on Tuesday.    	 Trade was volatile as investors were reluctant tomake big bets before the April 26-27 Federal Open MarketCommittee meeting while rate markets reflected that anytightening measure was going to be a long slow grind. 	 In fed fund futures markets <0#FF:>, the contract expiringin December 2011 has fully priced in a target interest rate of0.25 percent, the top end of the central bank's current raterange of zero to 0.25 percent but the January 2012 contract onlyimplied a slim 6 percent chance of another hike to 0.5 percent.	 Such bets on a glacially slow increase in rates have kepttraders interested in buying U.S. Treasuries, pushing the10-year U.S. yield down more than 20 basis points from thismonth's highs of 3.36 percent, despite a recent warning of aratings cut by ratings agency Standard & Poor's.	 	* For Reuters Global Investing Blog, click on 	 http://blogs.reuters.com/globalinvesting 	* For the MacroScope Blog, click on 	 http://blogs.reuters.com/macroscope 	 * For Hedge Fund Blog, click on 	 http://blogs.reuters.com/hedgehub		 (Additional reporting by Rujun Shen in SINGAPORE, Hideyuki Sanoin TOKYO and Umesh Desai; Editing by Ramya Venugopal)	              ]]></raw>
