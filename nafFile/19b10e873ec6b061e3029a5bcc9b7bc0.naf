<raw><![CDATA[ * Shanghai stocks pick up after rout, regional shares firm * PMI surveys show China economy maintaining upwardmomentum * Aussie dollar falls as c. bank says low rates appropriate * Euro gains ground as German retail sales beat forecasts By Susan Fenton HONG KONG, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Chinese shares bucked up onTuesday after Monday's rout, helped by upbeat economic data,but the Aussie dollar fell after the central bank dashedexpectations it would shift to a tighter policy bias. Major European stock futures  were up 0.7 percentand the euro  firmed to $1.4370 afterbetter-than-expected German retail sales. [ID:nL1226897] U.S. equity futures  were 0.3 percent higher,following gains in Asia and some signs of stabilisation inChinese markets. Shares in Shanghai  were up 0.7 percent bymid-afternoon after plunging nearly 7 percent in the previoussession -- their worst one-day loss since mid-2008 -- onpersistent fears the government is reining in bank lending tohead off potential asset bubbles. Stocks elsewhere in Asia posted modest gains, withinvestors keeping a wary eye on Chinese markets, althoughTaiwan's benchmark share index  jumped 2.8 percent onthe day on bullish earnings from the tech sector. [.TW] Investors in China were buoyed by data showing the Chineseeconomy maintained its upward momentum in August, with twopurchasing managers' indexes rising to their highest levels in16 months. [[ID:nPEK62430] "We're seeing an improvement in the PMI consistent with aneconomy still gaining momentum in August," said Glenn Maguire,Societe Generale's Chief Asia Economist. "If you look at the global suite of data for July, whichwere more or less strong, China continues to be in the vanguardof that trend." Japan's Nikkei  closed up 0.4 percent, helped by thestronger tone in Shanghai, but gains were limited by a firm yen, which put pressure on some exporters. The yen remained close to 7-week highs reached on Monday inthe wake of the Democratic Party's landslide election victory. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks traded outside Japan rose 1.4 percent. The index, like other major global benchmarks, hassputtered in recent weeks on fears that a six-month equityrally has run too far ahead of economic fundamentals, but it isstill up nearly 50 percent so far this year. BILL FUTURES RALLY Australia's central bank sent the Aussie dollar sliding by saying the current low level of Australian interestrates, at a record low of 3 percent, was appropriate.[ID:nSYD483279] That dashed some expectations it would shift to a tightermonetary bias. The Australian dollar  fell 0.2 percenton the day to $0.8418, after edging up close to last month's11-month peak ahead of the central bank's statement. "It sounds like the RBA doesn't want to bang the drum aboutrate hikes," Rory Robertson, interest rate strategist atMacquarie, said after the meeting. "Yes, the economy is in much better shape than anyonethought a few months ago. But it's not like it needs to berestrained, either." Australian bill futures <0#YBA:> rallied as investorsscaled back the chance of a rate rise in October. Across the region, there was lingering concern that whileeconomic data may be improving, the strength of a globaleconomic recovery is still in doubt. That was reinforced by a sharper-than-expected 20.6 percentdrop in South Korea's exports in August -- extendingdouble-digit annual declines to a 10th straight month --although equity investors took the data in their stride. Korea's benchmark KOSPI index  finished 2 percenthigher, helped by a 7.6 percent surge in shares of HyundaiMotor <005380.KS> and a 4.7 percent gain in Kia Motors<000270.KS> on the view that broader recent data suggests theeconomic environment is improving. In Taiwan, Hon Hai <2317.TW>, the world's largestelectronics maker, led technology shares higher, surging 6.8percent after its quarterly profit beat forecasts [ID:nTP3024]. Commodities markets were more nervous amid concern aboutChinese demand, but London copper recovered some losses aftersliding more than 3 percent in early trade after a holiday onMonday. U.S. crude futures  hovered around $70 a barrel aftersliding almost 4 percent on Monday on fears that Chineselending curbs would cool its economic recovery and keep a lidon energy demand.
