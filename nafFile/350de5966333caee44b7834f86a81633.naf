<raw><![CDATA[ * Investments to cover roads, farming, housing * Oil gain put at six percent of total 2011 revenues * Analysts urge efforts to bolster tax base  (Recasts with details and analysis) By Kwasi Kpodo and Hereward Holland ACCRA, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Ghana's 2011 budget due to beunveiled on Thursday will include major infrastructure and otherspending aimed at fostering economic growth and employment,according to a summary published by the finance ministry. However it came with a warning that oil due to start flowingfrom its Jubilee oilfield in coming weeks would only contributesix percentage points of total revenues next year and that theWest African country should not neglect existing industries. Analysts noted the pledge to spend would be scrutinised forits impact on public finances and whether it was accompanied byefforts to bolster Ghana's low rate of tax revenue collection. "There will be significant investments in the areas ofagriculture, energy, housing, rail transport, roads andhighways," said the summary, which gave no value to the plannedspending or its expected impact on the economy. President John Atta Mills' government focused on narrowingGhana's public deficit early in its term but will face pressureto boost the economy in line with a heavy burden of voterexpectation ahead of an election due in December 2012. "If you look at the political economic cycle you realisethat this is the year the government will push hard to meet thesocial demands of the public," said Sampson Akligo, senioranalyst at Accra-based investment house Databank. Ghana's cedi traded flat around 1.4350 to the dollar onWednesday while its $750 million Eurobond yielded around sixpercent. Ghana joined the world ranking of middle-income countriesthis month with a new statistical measure of its economy thatadded over 60 percent to its output by giving more weight torecent growth areas such as telephony and banking.  FOCUS ON NON-OIL SECTORS Although purely statistical, the rebasing instantly cutsdebt and deficit ratios that had given rise to concern. Thefinance ministry had estimated a 2011 public deficit of 7.5percent of GDP before the re-basing. The budget document said spending will focus on greatermechanisation of the farming sector; completion of roadprojects; the rehabilitation or rebuilding of the rail network;and the construction of 200,000 new affordable housing units. Ghana's economic growth is seen rising from 6.6 percent thisyear to above 10 percent next year, partly as a result of oil.But the budget summary said oil would account for just sixpercent of total government revenue. "Ghanaians must therefore continue to focus their attentionon the non-oil sectors of the economy which hitherto have beenthe backbone of the economy," it said. Ghana is a major goldproducer and the world's second largest cocoa exporter. "This is a much more reasonable basis than earlierprojections," said Razia Khan, regional head of research forStandard Chartered Bank. Ghana expects to produce 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) inthe first three years that could ramp up to 250,000 bpd which,based on current levels, would make it sub-Saharan Africa'ssixth largest producer. Its impact on public finances will partly depend on theoutcome of parliamentary debate over long-awaited legislationgoverning the oil revenues, with lawmakers split on how much ofthem can be used as collateral for borrowing. Gold Coast Securities head of research Collins Appiah urgedthe government to examine how it could improve its tax base,with fiscal revenues put at around 16-18.5 percent of GDP afterthe re-basing. "Most people are in the informal sector and the governmentfinds it difficult to tax them, so the thinking should be abouthow best they can get revenue from them," he said.             ]]></raw>
