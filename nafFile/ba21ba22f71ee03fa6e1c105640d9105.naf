<raw><![CDATA[ (For more stories on the Japanese economy, click) * New BOJ member Morimoto says strong yen to hurt sentiment * Deputy finmin says weak yen good for Japan exporters * Dollar/yen near 2-mth low, euro/yen near 8-½   yr trough * BOJ tankan shows sentiment best in 2 years, outlook murky (Recasts, adds quotes, details) By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Rie Ishiguro TOKYO, July 1 (Reuters) - Japanese policymakers lashed out ata rising yen on Thursday, warning that the currency's gains dueto worries about the global economic recovery and Europe'sfinancial woes could threaten Japan's tepid economic revival. Bank of Japan board member Yoshihisa Morimoto, in his firstpress conference after joining the central bank, said he iswatching the yen closely because it could hurt profits andsentiment. One of Japan's two deputy finance ministers also saida weak yen is "generally beneficial" to the country's exporters. The BOJ's April-June tankan survey showed on Thursday thatbig manufacturers turned optimistic for the first time in twoyears as a rapid recovery in exports has boosted corporateprofits. The outlook is less encouraging because export growth hasstarted slowing and domestic demand could weaken as companiesstill have excess labour, economists say. The yen could be aworry for Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who is trying to convincevoters before an election next week that his Democratic Party canspur growth and repair public finances with higher taxes. "A stronger yen and weaker euro will affect firms' globalcompetitiveness, profits and sentiment," Morimoto said. Morimoto, a former executive at Tokyo Electric Power Co,Asia's biggest utility, started work on Thursday, filling thefinal vacancy on the BOJ's nine-member board. The yen edged higher on Thursday, with the euro dipping 0.1percent to 108.09 yen. The euro fell as low as 107.50 yenearlier, nearing an 8-½   year trough of 107.30 yen hit thisweek. The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 88.38 yen after striking atwo-month low of 88.08 yen on EBS earlier. EXPORTERS' PAIN The yen's latest rise has brought it to levels that couldcause pain to Japanese exporters if gains are sustained, with theBOJ's tankan survey showing the average forecast for thedollar/yen rate in the year to next March among largemanufacturers is 90.18 yen. A stronger yen erodes exporters' profits when repatriated andmakes their products more expensive overseas. Japan has not intervened in the currency market since March2004 and is unlikely to resume intervention because it supportsmore flexibility in China's yuan, analysts say. Japanese officials are more likely to stick to verbalintervention by trying to talk down the yen, analysts say. "There's no use asking me about foreign exchange ratesbecause I won't comment," deputy finance minister Motohisa Ikedasaid on Thursday, when asked about recent yen gains against othercurrencies and their impact on the Japanese economy. "But I'm aware that they say, generally speaking, a weak yenis good for Japan which has a high weighting of exportindustries." Ikeda, speaking to reporters, also said he would not commenton specific currency levels. He emphasised the government's stance of avoiding excessiveyen rises so the country can achieve economic growth backed byboth external and domestic demand, as pledged in its growthstrategy aimed at achieving an average 2 percent growth over thenext decade. Japan's ruling Democratic Party faces a July 11 upper houseelection that it needs to win to forge ahead with policiesincluding steps to rein in huge public debt, such as a possiblesales tax rise in two or three years.
