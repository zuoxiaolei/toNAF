<raw><![CDATA[ PORT-LOUIS, June 17 (Reuters) - Air Mauritius reported a netloss of 6 million euros ($7.4 million) for the year to March 31,improved from a loss of 85.5 million a year earlier thanks inpart to improved fuel hedging. Air Mauritius said it remained vulnerable to the crisis inthe euro zone and to the fact that its costs are mostlydenominated in dollars but its revenue in euros. "This reflects the persistent impact of the global crisis onthe airline and tourism industries. However, this year netresults constitute a significant improvement," Chief ExecutiveOfficer Manoj Ujoodha said in a statement. Operating profit -- excluding hedge costs -- rose to 32.6million euros from a 15.3 million euro profit in the previousyear. Its fuel hedge pay out stood at 38.5 million euros,compared with a 100.5 million euros a year before. The airline said the various marketing campaigns undertakenhad led to a record load factor of 80.6 percent compared with74.6 percent a year before. The Indian Ocean island is a popular holiday destination,but the European economic slowdown has weighed heavily on itstourism industry.
