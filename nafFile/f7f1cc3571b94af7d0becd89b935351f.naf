<raw><![CDATA[ * Asian shares rise, help cross-yen higher * Dlr/yen up on short-covering before U.S. payrolls * Yen dented by report saying BOJ to consider easing steps By Satomi Noguchi TOKYO, March 5 (Reuters) - The yen slipped broadly on Fridayon climbing Asian shares and as China reaffirmed its easymonetary stance, prompting short-term players to buyhigher-yielding currencies. The dollar rose against the yen and was supported versusother major currencies as investors grew cautious about sellingthe greenback too far after worries that views on U.S. payrollnumbers due later in the day may have been too pessimistic. The dollar's move up against the Japanese currency washelped by a report that the Bank of Japan was weighing furthereasing measures, traders said. China's key stock index opened higher on Friday afterPremier Wen Jiabao said China would stick to an appropriatelyeasy monetary stance and a proactive fiscal policy. "Wen Jiabao's remarks reassured the market that China onlywants to rein in certain sectors, and that it does not intend toput a strong brake on the economy," said Nobuhiko Akai, seniormanager of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ's forex trading group. Hong Kong and China stocks fell on Thursday as persistentconcern over policy tightening spurred investors to take profitsand prompted short-term players to cut risky positions inhigher-yielding currencies for the yen for its perceived safety. The dollar rose 0.2 percent on the yen from late on Thursdayin New York to 89.23 yen, recovering from a 3-month low of 88.14yen struck on trading platform EBS the previous day. The interbank cost of borrowing three-month dollar fundsedged higher on Thursday, while it fell for yen funds, takingthe Japanese currency rate below that of the greenback for thefirst time since August. Some traders said that drop in three-month yen Libor mayhave been another reason for the yen's weakness against thedollar in late Thursday trade. The euro remained on the defensive as a short squeeze in thesingle currency appeared to have run its course, with investorsfretting about debt-laden Greece and Moody's cutting DeutscheBank's ratings.. The euro stood at $1.3592, edging up 0.1 percent. Itrecovered a tad from its 0.8 percent loss the day before when itmoved in choppy trade following a robust response to a Greekdebt auction. The euro gained 0.3 percent to 121.26 yen and the Australiandollar rose 0.1 percent to 80.30 yen. JOBS DATA Traders said the market was likely to stay cautious ahead ofkey U.S. payrolls data. Forecasts are for a cut of 50,000 jobs,but many analysts warned the data was distorted by a wave ofsnowstorms that hit the United States. "Weather is really the X-factor there and the data couldthrow up anything," said Jonathan Cavenagh, currency strategistat Westpac. "The market is bearish on the numbers, so any upsidesurprise could actually lift the U.S. dollar. Also, Greeceworries continue and with investors still cautious about risk, Iwould have a bias towards the U.S. dollar ahead of the payrollsdata." The dollar index was steady at 80.48, with near-termresistance seen around 81.30, this week's high. Investors also fretted about whether Greece's fresh plans toaddress its debt woes would win wider support in the EuropeanUnion ahead of a meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel withthe Greek prime minister later on Friday. Greece announced plans on Wednesday for a further $6.5billion in public sector pay cuts and tax hikes to whittle itsbudget deficit.
