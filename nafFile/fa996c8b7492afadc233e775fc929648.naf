<raw><![CDATA[  * Wall St gives back early gains on weekly jobless claims * World stocks extend losses * US crude down and dollar down too (Updates with U.S. markets' open; updates prices, activity) By Barani Krishnan NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - World stocks and oil slumpedfor a second straight day on Thursday as the latest U.S.economic data kept investors on the edge, with a slight drop inclaims for jobless benefits not enough to assuage fears aboutthe economy's path. The dollar fell to a one-month low against the euro asGreece agreed to new measures to cut its deficit, mitigatingfears over its debt crisis and making investors shift theirfocus to the U.S. economy. On Wall Street, the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index  fell below its May low as investors reacted to the dataon jobless claims. First-time claims for jobless benefits inthe latest week fell by 6,000 to 422,000. The figure was belowexpectations for a decline to 415,000. [ID:nN02246578] "Every indication we have had so far points to a slightlysofter labor market in the U.S.," said Camilla Sutton, chiefcurrency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. Nervous investors honed in on key market levels to managerisk a day after stocks suffered their worst one-day fall innearly a year. Appetite for risk-taking had been on the decline since lateMay due to lackluster data from both emerging and developedeconomies. "We've been through a couple week period here wherebasically every piece of economic data has just been awful,"said John Canally, investment strategist and economist for LPFinancial in Boston. The Dow Jones industrial average  was down 78.29points, or 0.64 percent, at 12,211.85. The Standard & Poor's500 Index  was down 6.28 points, or 0.48 percent, at1,308.27. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down 4.25points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,764.94. DOLLAR, OIL DOWN; BONDS EASE With the U.S. Federal Reserve set to wrap up its $600billion bond buying program later this month, signals of moreeconomic weakness ahead are especially worrying to investorsinvolved in riskier assets such as equities, high-yield bondsand emerging markets. The MSCI index of global equities fell 1.01 percent. European shares fell to a one-week closing low as the U.S.data raised concerns about the pace of recovery in the world'sbiggest economy. The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European sharesprovisionally finished 1.2 percent lower at 1,117.09 points --the lowest close since May 23. The euro jumped 1 percent against the dollar to a one-monthhigh  on optimism that European officials will reach anagreement on how to help Greece repay its debt. The growth unease has seen investors pile into safe-havenU.S. and German bonds, with U.S. 10-year yields falling under 3percent on Wednesday for the first time since last December. Treasuries dipped slightly as investors cashed in on recentgains, pushing up the benchmark 10-year yield  3.1basis points. But the yield stayed under 3 percent and isunlikely to rise much in the current environment.
