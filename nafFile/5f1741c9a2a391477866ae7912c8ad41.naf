Oil fell on fears of slowing demand, including a drop inChina's crude imports, while bond and gold prices jumped. The concern about Italy, the euro zone's third-largesteconomy, prompted an emergency meeting of top European Unionofficials. Italian government bonds and stocks dropped as investorscut their exposure amid fears that the country, with thehighest sovereign debt ratio relative to GDP in the euro zoneafter Greece, could be next to get dragged into the crisis.For details, see [ID:nL6E7IB06Z]and [ID:nLDE76A07W] The news comes amid efforts to help Greece with its debtproblems before they affect other countries and banks,especially European ones heavily exposed to Greek debt. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  shotup 27/32 in price, pushing its yield down to 2.93 percent onMonday from 3.02 percent late on Friday. "We are seeing some follow-through buying in Treasuries,and the European situation continues to fester. It is just anenvironment where there are a lot of factors that are stackingup as bullish for bonds," said Marty Mitchell, head ofgovernment bond trading at Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore. A weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report on Friday and datashowing China's import growth fell to its slowest pace in 20months also drove investors away from stocks. "The dual situations of U.S. debt and Europe are verysevere and causing so much uncertainty on a globalmacroeconomic basis," said Joseph Cangemi, managing directorat BNY ConvergEx Group in New York. The MSCI world equity index  fell 2 percentto a one-week low and the three major U.S. stock indexesdropped more than 1 percent.

The euro  was down 1.7 percent at $1.4025, afterearlier hitting a session low at $1.3984, its lowest in sixweeks. "Italy would be a challenge that makes Greece lookminiature by comparison," said Karl Schamotta, seniorstrategist at Western Union Business Solutions in Calgary. "Wehave a wide-ranging contagion issue here -- or at least theperception of one -- and that's making people very nervous." JP Morgan said Italian banks are vulnerable because oftheir high reliance on wholesale funding. Moreover, theirgovernment bond holdings stand at 6.33 percent of assets,higher than those of Spanish banks. Oil prices were pressured by the concern about theEuropean debt crisis.
