<raw><![CDATA[ * Russia interested in Soviet-era projects * Karzai lauds "great power" Russia in Moscow trip * Kabul supports Russian involvement in gas pipeline  (Updates with statement on Inter Rao) By Alexei Anishchuk MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzaiinvited Russia on Friday to rebuild Soviet-era facilities inAfghanistan, courting a nation eager to expand its influencedecades after the Soviet Union's costly war there. "We want to give a new start to vital projects that werebegun very long ago," Karzai, on his second visit to Moscow insix months, said at a news conference with President DmitryMedvedev after their talks in the Kremlin. The leaders issued a joint declaration in which Russiaexpressed its readiness to participate in "priority economicprojects" in Afghanistan, some dating back to the Soviet era. The projects included the Salang Tunnel in the Hindu Kushmountains, hydroelectric power facilities in Kabul and Baglanprovinces, a customs terminal and a university in Kabul. Neither the declaration nor the leaders mentioned the costor potential terms. Russia has said it would rebuild Soviet-erainfrastructure in Afghanistan provided the internationalcommunity underwrote the cost. The declaration expressed support for Russian involvement ina proposed gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to India viaAfghanistan and Pakistan, subject to other countries' approval. Ex-Soviet Turkmenistan, eager to lessen reliance onlong-dominant gas buyer Russia, has been cool toward Russianparticipation. Russia is seeking to increase its influence in Afghanistan,where Soviet forces fought a nearly decade-long war in the1980s. Karzai, whose country is eyeing the eventual withdrawal ofU.S. and NATO forces after their own decade-long war against theTaliban, said he wants to step up ties with Moscow. "Russia is a great power," Karzai said in a speech atRussia's Academy of Sciences. "For us, Russia is ... a teacher." Moscow has ruled out sending troops to Afghanistan, wheresome 15,000 Soviet soldiers died fighting mujahideen insurgentsbefore pulling out in 1989. With the Afghan government expected to take the lead insecurity nationwide by the end of 2014, Medvedev said Moscowwould continue to help train and equip Afghan forces and providetransit routes for NATO. Russia will hold talks with the United States next month onplans for the sale of 21 Mi-17 helicopters for use inAfghanistan, Russian foreign ministry official Zamir Kabulovsaid on the sidelines of the Kremlin meetings. In a separate meeting, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putinsaid his country would invest $500 million in the CentralAsia-South Asia (CASA) 1000 electricity project if Russianutility Inter RAO is selected as its operator. "If our company Inter RAO is granted the right to be theoperator, we can join in the construction of the high-voltageCASA 1000 transmission line," Putin said. The project is designed to transmit electricty fromKyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to South Asia.
