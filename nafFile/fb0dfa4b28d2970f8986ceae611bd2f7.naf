<raw><![CDATA[ * Special treatment for Japan Post could breach WTO rules * Level playing field, not privatisation, the issue  GENEVA, May 21 (Reuters) - The United States and EuropeanUnion contested the status of Japan's mammoth postal, bankingand insurance conglomerate on Friday, saying the specialtreatment of the group hurts private-sector competitors. Japan Post's status creates an unlevel playing field forprivate competitors in the insurance, banking and expressdelivery sectors, the U.S. ambassador to the World TradeOrganization, Michael Punke, and EU acting ambassador JohnClarke, told their Japanese counterpart, Shinichi Kitajima. "We met jointly with Japan to underscore the deep level ofconcern that we both share regarding Japan's preferentialtreatment of Japan Post in light of Japan's national treatmentcommitments under the WTO," Punke said in a statement. With assets of 300 trillion yen ($3.3 trillion), Japan Postis a major player in Japan's banking and insurance markets aswell as in mail and courier services. As the holder of about athird of Japanese Government Bonds it is also a key partner inthe government's debt management programmes. But its future has become highly political, with Japan'sDemocratic Party-led government rolling back plans to privatisethe institution but set to endorse a proposal to double depositlimits at its banking unit, raising the possibility of fundsdraining from other banks but making it easier for Japan to fundits growing debt. Both the United States and European Union are neutral onwhether Japan Post should be privatised, the U.S. statementsaid. But they expressed disappointment that draft postal reformlegislation submitted to Japan's Diet does not address U.S. andEU concerns about the preferential treatment that Japan Postcurrently receives compared to private-sector companies. They also said they were worried by proposals to allow JapanPost's banking and insurance units to expand their operationsbefore a level playing field is established. One US and EU concern is that Japan Post's insuranceoperations have preferential access to the postal network,giving it an advantage over private financial companies. Japan gives full national treatment to foreign companies inthe insurance sector under WTO rules, and Japan Post's specialtreatment could breach those commitments, they said. Japan Post's foreign competitors in the delivery sectorinclude United Parcel Service, FedEx, TNT and Deutsche Post.
