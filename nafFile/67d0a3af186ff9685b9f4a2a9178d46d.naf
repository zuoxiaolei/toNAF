<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro soars, on course to test key $1.40 mark * Trichet says to exercise 'strong vigilance' on inflation * Analysts caution about profit-taking in euro (Adds comment, details, updates prices) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - The euro soared against theU.S. dollar on Thursday, edging towards the psychologicallyimportant $1.40 level, after European Central Bank PresidentJean-Claude Trichet cemented expectations of a near-terminterest rate rise. In a press conference after the ECB left its benchmark rateat 1.0 percent, Trichet said the ECB will exercise "strongvigilance" over rising inflation, deploying a phrase that inthe past signaled a rate rise was only a month away.

The euro rallied as high as $1.3976 , itsstrongest level since early November after rising aboveresistance around its 200-day moving average at $1.3958. Itlast traded at $1.3933, up 0.5 percent on the day. Some analysts cautioned now that with the Trichet pressconference out of the way and the euro testing the key $1.3950and $1.40 resistance area, profit-taking may set in, whichcould see the euro stabilize in the $1.38 and $1.3850 area. "A lot of people were expecting a hawkish statement fromTrichet and he's delivered everything that the hawks had beenlooking for. I'm very alert right now for some potentialprofit-taking," said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist atForex.com in Bedminster in New Jersey. He added that Trichet's comments that the ECB would carryon providing unlimited funding at its three-month operationsfor the next three months, also suggests "there's ongoingfragility in the European Banking sector." Against the yen, the euro jumped to a session peak of114.83 yen on Reuters data , before pulling backslightly to trade at 114.78 yen, up 1.1 percent on the day. The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 82.31 yen , gettinga lift after data showed new U.S. claims for unemploymentbenefits fell last week to their lowest level in more than2-1/2 years.
