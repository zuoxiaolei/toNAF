The euro, however, gained broadly, recovering early lossesafter European banks borrowed less money than expected from aEuropean Central Bank's tender, cooling concerns over euro zonebanks' funding issues. The single currency was also supported by Madrid's abilityto sell five-year bonds following Moody's Investors Service onWednesday put Spain's sovereign rating on review for possibledowngrade. Chinese manufacturing PMI data slowed in June, heighteningconcerns over the global economic recovery and weighing onhigh-yielding currencies. "The underlying market is still that rather negativesentiment. The currencies that are in particular picking up assafe-havens are Swiss franc and the yen," Simon Derrick, head ofcurrency research at Bank of New York Mellon in London. By 1200 GMT, the U.S. currency fell about 0.8 percent to87.62 yen on trading platform EBS, its weakest in seven months,as traders took a stab at stop-loss orders suspected around thedollar's weakest of the year. The dollar dropped 0.6 percentagainst a basket of major currencies. The euro advanced 0.8 percent to $1.2332, according toReuters data, extending gains for a second straight day andrebounding from a two-week low around $1.2150 hit earlier in theweek. The euro steadied at 1.3181 Swiss francs, though the singlecurrency had pulled away from 1.3073 hit earlier in the day, itsweakest since its 1999 launch. Against the yen, it was flat at 108.15 yen, recovering froman 8 1/2-year low of 107.30 yen hit this week. The euro earlier hit a lifetime low versus the Swiss francafter Moody's warning, raising worries about the health of someeuro zone countries as the global economy slows. However, the results of the six-day ECB tender, which waslargely in line with expectations, helped the euro to holdgains, as speculation that banks may not be as desperate forfunds as previously had thought. Thursday's tender followed an offer of three-month fundingthe previous day, which received less bids than expected,indicating that euro zone banks were fairly well positioned torepay ECB's 442 billion euros emergency loans on Thursday. The Australian dollar, which is seen as a proxy forBeijing's economic strength as China sucks up many of its rawmaterials, traded at $0.8360 after hitting a session low of$0.8315. The Swedish crown hit the day's low against the euro of9.6030 per euro after Sweden's central bank raised interestrates by 25 basis points to 0.5 percent as expected, but saidthe pace of more monetary tightening would likely slow.
