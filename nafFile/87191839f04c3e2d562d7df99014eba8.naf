<raw><![CDATA[ * Report urges shift away from bilateral free trade deals * Obama should focus on sector deals with larger nations By Doug Palmer WASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - President Barack Obamashould move U.S. trade policy away from the Bushadministration's focus on bilateral free trade agreements to anew approach more in line with his economic and foreign policygoals, a report recommended on Wednesday. The Bush administration negotiated trade deals withAustralia, Chile, Singapore, Morocco and other small and medium-sized countries that caused divisive debates in Congresswithout yielding much economic benefit for the United States,the report by the Democratic Leadership Council think tanksaid. Obama should target new trade talks toward bigger economieslike Japan, the European Union, Brazil, India and China andfocus on removing barriers in high-wage growth sectors such ashealth, clean energy, and environmental technology, rather thanseeking comprehensive free trade deals, it said. The White House should "shift the trade agenda to one thatdirectly supports its top objectives: recovery from crisis,improved relations with the world generally and Muslim statesin particular, and developing new, high-tech sources forAmerica's future growth, innovation and high-wage employment,"the DLC said. But first the Obama administration needs to "clear thedecks" over the next year by working with Congress to win itsapproval of free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombiaand Panama left over from the administration of formerPresident George W. Bush, the report said. It also should quickly finish the Doha round of world tradetalks, now in its eighth year, by concluding an overall deal orbreaking the negotiations into easier-to-manage componentparts, it said. The report comes as many in Washington and around the worldare waiting for the Obama administration to lay out its visionfor trade. Last week, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirkunveiled plans for increased enforcement of existing tradeagreements, but it remains unclear what new trade initiativesthe White House will pursue. In a time when many Americans are worried about job losses,"the administration needs to be able to explain its tradepolicy simply and easily. The trade agenda now does not lenditself to that," said Ed Gresser, director of the DLC's GlobalEconomy Project and author of the report. The White House, consistent with its goal of improvingrelations with the Muslim world, also should ask Congress towaive tariffs on goods from large majority-Muslim states suchas Pakistan whose main exports -- such as clothing, textiles,shoes and leather goods -- face some of the highest U.S. importduties, Gresser said.
