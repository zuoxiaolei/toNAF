<raw><![CDATA[ * Parliament convenes early to decide on Icesave vote * Referendum seen in late February, early March * Govt spokesman says no plan B to holding referendum  By Omar Valdimarsson REYKJAVIK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Iceland's parliament meets onFriday to thrash out plans for a referendum on the terms underwhich the country will repay more than $5 billion to Britain andthe Netherlands in the wake of a banking collapse. British and Dutch depositors in high-interest "Icesave" bankaccounts lost their money when Iceland's entire financial systemimploded in late 2008 under a massive weight of debt. The two countries compensated their savers in full and wanttheir money back from Iceland. But Icelandic President OlafurGrimsson this week unexpectedly refused to sign a bill to repaythem. His rejection has thrown the country into crisis andjeopardised continued aid from international lenders, seen asvital for getting the economy back on its feet. The government now plans to hold a referendum late inFebruary or early in March, but the result is highly uncertainwith opinion polls suggesting a majority of the 320,000Icelanders oppose the so-called Icesave bill. "They have to decide the date and the law is quite simple,"said Einar Haraldsson, spokesman at the prime minister's office. "There will be a debate on the phrasing of the question." If the new Icesave law is rejected, an earlier version --passed during the summer -- enters into force. Britain and theNetherlands said the terms outlined under the earlier bill wereunacceptable, mainly because repayments would not be guaranteedby the Icelandic government after 2024. The small North Atlantic island is under heavy pressure fromlenders and credit rating agencies. Opposition leaders, whoinitially demanded a referendum, appear to have got cold feetabout a public vote on Icesave. Several have been quoted in Icelandic newspapers as sayingit may not be too late to avoid a referendum and instead try fornew talks with Britain and the Netherlands. Haraldsson said the government was not actively looking foran alternative to holding the referendum, though a newinitiative from Britain, the Netherlands or a third party couldpotentially unlock the situation." "No, there is no B plan," he said. "Something new has tocome into the picture ... But this has to be very drastic andwith an outlook for a solution." Many Icelanders are angry about the bill -- which onlysqueezed through parliament by 33 votes to 30. They believe itlumbers the island's taxpayers with a crippling burden which isnot their responsibility. Others believe that though the price to be paid is high, itis the only way to restore the country to economic normality,ensure it has access to international markets and can join theEuropean Union, a move seen as crucial to long-term financialstability. How big the final bill is depends on how much money can berecovered from the sale of assets held by Landsbanki -- thefailed bank that offered the Icesave accounts and held the bulkof Dutch and British savers' money.
