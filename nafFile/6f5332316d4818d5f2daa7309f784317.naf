<raw><![CDATA[ Position: Bank of Russia Governor Incumbent: Sergei Ignatyev Term: March 2002 to present.  Key Facts: -- Was appointed for a third term -- a first in Russia'spost-Soviet history -- in June 2009. There are no limits as tohow many four-year terms the central bank governor may serve,though Ignatyev's current stint officially ends in 2013. -- Ignatyev has overseen the inflation battle of the oilboom years and the scrapping of capital controls. -- He also led the central bank during the 2008-2009 crisis,when the regulator staged a gradual devaluation of the ruble.The policy was subsequently judged to be successful, as itmanaged to avoid panic and mass flight from the ruble seenduring the previous crisis, in 1998. -- Under Ignatyev, the central bank has been stepping up itscommunication and becoming more open, as it gradually increasesthe importance of interest rates and moves toward targetinginflation rather than the exchange rate. -- Ignatyev took his first high-ranking job at the economyand finance ministry under the pro-reform administration ofPrime Minister Yegor Gaidar when President Boris Yeltsin was inpower. -- The grey-haired, bespectacled Ignatyev is reticent withthe press, almost never giving interviews and restrictingcontact to occasional news conferences. Colleagues havecharacterized him as a very careful man, who takes a balancedapproach and tends to avoid controversial decisions. -- Ignatyev, an author of more than 20 academic papers andholder of a PhD in economics, hails from current Prime MinisterVladimir Putin's home town of St Petersburg and portrays himselfas a non-party affiliated moderate reformer. -- Russia's central bank is officially independent, althoughanalysts have questioned the scope of the government's influenceon policy. The central bank famously embarked on a campaign ofinterest rate cuts in April 2009, just a day after Putinpublicly told Ignatyev rate cuts were possible given lowerinflation. -- Ignatyev, a keen smoker, earned 19.5 million rubles($645,900) in 2009, co-owns a flat with his wife and has the useof a central bank country house, according to official data.
