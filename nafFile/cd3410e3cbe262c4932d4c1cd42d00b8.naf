<raw><![CDATA[Dollar ends week broadly lower after soft U.S. jobs reportInvesting.com - The dollar was broadly lower against the other main currencies on Friday after data showed that the U.S. economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month, but the data did little to alter expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to scale back its stimulus program.The U.S. economy added 113,000 jobs in January, the Labor Department said, well below expectations for 185,000 new jobs, as inclement weather contributed to the slowdown in hiring.The report also showed that the number of people participating in the labor force edged up to 63% from a 30-year low of 62.8% last month, while the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked down to a five year low 6.6% from 6.7% in December.The report was seen as unlikely to prompt to Fed to halt reductions in its stimulus program. The bank announced a second cut to its asset purchase program in January, trimming it to $65 billion-per-month.EUR/USD rose to 1.3642, the highest level since January 30 and was last up 0.32% to 1.3634.

It was the largest increase since August and beat expectations for jobs growth of 20,000.
