<raw><![CDATA[CHAEL LEWIS, GLOBAL HEAD OF COMMODITIES RESEARCH, DEUTSCHE BANK:    	 "China tightening reserve requirements is just part of the arsenal that they will use and we would expect to see more of these measures coming through.    	 "Our sense is that energy and industrial metals are most exposed to this sort of Chinese action because obviously it is going to raise people's concerns about the growth outlook."	  -- LEE HARDMAN, CURRENCY ECONOMIST AT BANK OF TOKYO-MITSUBISHI UFJ:	 "We saw an initial sell-off in commodities and the Australian dollar. But since there had been speculation of a rate hike earlier in the day, it took the risk factor out, which perhaps helped boost risk sentiment. However, there is still the prospect of a Chinese rate increase before the year-end."	 (Reporting by Aileen Wang and Simon Rabinovitch; Edited by Don Durfee)	                 ]]></raw>
