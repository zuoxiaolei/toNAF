<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The U.S. dollar jumped to a three-day high against its Canadian counterpart on Thursday, as risk aversion sharpened after disappointing data on U.S. jobless claims added to fears over the U.S. economic recovery.USD/CAD hit 0.9818 during U.S. morning trade, the pair’s highest since June 20; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.9813, gaining 0.77%.  The pair was likely to find support at 0.9699, Wednesday’s low and resistance at 0.9849, the high of June 20.The U.S. Department of Labor said earlier that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending June 18 rose by 9K to a seasonally adjusted 429K, confounding expectations for a decline to 410K. The previous week’s figure was revised up to 420K from 414K. The downbeat data exacerbated fears over U.S. growth prospects after the Federal Reserve downgraded its 2011 U.S. economic growth forecast to a range of 2.7% to 2.9%, down from a previous estimate of 3.1% to 3.3% on Wednesday. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke confirmed that the bank was winding up its USD600 billion bond-buying program at the end of June and said further easing was unlikely.  Meanwhile, the loonie was also pressured as crude oil for delivery in August extended sharp losses, tumbling 3.5% on the New York Mercantile Exchange, to trade at a four month low of USD91.25 a barrel. Canada's economy relies heavily on oil exports and its currency is affected by swings in their prices.Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar was up against the euro, with EUR/CAD slumping 0.69% to trade at 1.3885.Later in the day, the U.S. was to release official data on new home sales.              ]]></raw>
