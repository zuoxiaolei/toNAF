<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen falls as Japan PM resigns; likely successor in focus * ECB's Noyer says euro not unusually low * Rise in U.S. pending home sales supports dollar * Euro reverses loss vs dollar, move called "anemic" (Recasts, updates prices, adds quotes) NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - The yen dropped on Wednesdayas the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyamaraised concerns about the outlook for the currency, given thathis likely successor has said in the past he wanted a weakeryen. The yen hit a two-week low against the dollar afterHatoyama and his deputy resigned to try to boost the rulingparty's faltering fortunes in an election next month. The Japanese currency fell as investors focused onHatoyama's expected replacement, Finance Minister Naoto Kan.Concerns about political instability were also weighing on theJapanese currency, analysts said. Kan surprised markets earlier this year by saying he wantedthe yen to weaken more and that most businesses favored adollar/yen rate around 95 yen. Since then he has mostly toedthe Finance Ministry line that stable currencies are desirableand markets should set foreign exchange levels. "Kan is a noted dove who has been an aggressive proponentof a lower yen in order to help stimulate Japanese exports,"said Boris Schlossberg, a director of currency research at GFT,in New York. "With Japanese political situation in state of flux, thedollar may be the only safe-haven instrument left in thecurrency market for the time being," he added. In mid afternoon trading in New York, the dollar was up 1.3percent on the day at 92.17 yen, while the euro gained 1.3percent to 112.73 yen. Some analysts said yen losses were limited as investorsremained hungry for the Japanese currency, which has benefitedfrom risk aversion stemming from the euro zone debt crisis. YEN FUTURES The June yen futures listed on the CME traded about 150points lower on news of the Japanese prime ministerresignation, said Kevin Cook, market analyst at option marketmarket maker PEAK6 Investments in Chicago. "It looks like the move started last night or about 8:30p.m., said Cook. "There was an initial reaction that took theyen about 100 points lower against the dollar and then it justdrifted lower overnight. Overnight we went from 1.10 to 1.085on the June yen futures." The reaction was relatively muted. "To put this in perspective on May 6, U.S. equities fellout of bed and the June yen futures went from 1.06 to 1.14which dwarfs today's move," Cook said. The dollar also rose as data released on Wednesday showedthat pending sales of previously owned homes in the UnitedStates topped expectations to hit a six-month high in April. "If you look at this (report) from a yield and growthdifferential perspective, I think it's positive for thedollar," said Michael Malpede, a senior analyst at Easy Forex,in Chicago. "If it weren't for the EU debt crisis, I'd be inthe camp that says the Fed moves sooner rather than later" onraising interest rates. While the report was positive, analysts said the key dataremains the government's monthly reading on non-farm payrollsdue on Friday. NOYER COMMENTS The euro managed to gain 0.1 percent against the dollar to$1.2235, coming off the global lows of the day as the New Yorksession wound down. Earlier, the single currency fell after European CentralBank board member Christian Noyer was cited as saying thesingle currency's exchange rate against the greenback was ataround a 10-year average and "by no means an unusually lowlevel." Traders described the move late in the session as "anemic"at best, with perhaps higher U.S. stock prices indicatingslightly more risk appetite. "It's a pause, that's all," said John McCarthy, director offoreign exchange trading at ING Capital Markets in New York ofthe euro move. "Nothing has changed from the Europeanstandpoint." Analysts at ScotiaCapital said technical signals on theeuro are mixed, but they expect further downside before thecurrency is able to sustain a rally. The next key level ofsupport is the psychological $1.20, followed by $1.1835, theaverage level of the euro since its inception. The euro hit a four-year low of $1.2110 on Tuesday, andremains sensitive to any signs the euro zone sovereign debtcrisis might spread to the banking system of the 16-nationregion. Euro/dollar risk reversals are at extreme levels, showing abias for puts at a bid of -3.5 on Wednesday, according to GFIdata. Wednesday's figure was, however, off the highs from twoweeks ago, which was at -3.73, the most bearish investors hadever been on the euro since GFI made its data available toReuters in early 2007.
