<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro pinned near three-week lows on dollar * Rising stocks, commodities keep Aussie well-bid * Pound near 3-month low after UK public borrowing data By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The euro won a reprieve afterplumbing new lows on the Swiss franc and Australian dollar onWednesday but the single currency is seen stuck in a slow descentas a steady drip of grim ratings news erodes confidence in it. The latest blows came from Moody's, which warned it might cutPortugal's rating, and Fitch, which said the same about Greece. "Though one might suppose the market had become somewhatdesensitized to such news, evidence suggests otherwise asperiphery-bund spreads widen again and EUR remains underpressure," David Watt, a senior currency strategist at RBCDominion, said in a note to clients. A dearth of liquidity and talk of bids by Asian central bankshelped limit the euro's fall against the dollar for now. The euro gained 0.2 percent in Asia to $1.3129, climbingabove its 200-day moving average of $1.3098 and off a nearthree-week trough of $1.3073 set on Tuesday But it fared less well against the safe-haven Swiss franc andhigh-yielding Australian dollar. "EUR/CHF is going deeper into uncharted territory havingbroken 1.26, and continuing to dig deeper," said Watt, as theeuro slid to a new low of 1.2533 francs for a loss of almost 4percent so far this month. Traders said some investors had been shifting funds away fromeuro zone bonds to the Swiss franc. Possible near-term targets include 1.2300, while in thelonger term it could look to around 1.1760, an Elliot waveequality target, though the franc's low yield may deter fundinflows. The euro stood at A$1.3180 after shedding 2 cents in as manysessions. For the year it is off 17 percent. "From near A$2.0 in March 2009, EUR/AUD has been underrelentless downward pressure," Watt said. "The recent movesuggests an acceleration to the downside, with 1.30 in focus." The Australian currency was underpinned by further gains inequities and commodities, suggesting improving risk appetite asanalysts revise up forecasts for global growth in 2011. On Tuesday the S&P 500 finally recovered all the ground lostsince the Lehman debacle, while the CRB commodities index reacheda two-year peak. "In the currency and European bond markets risk aversion isprevailing. But in many other markets we've seen risk-taking,"said Tohru Sasaki, chief strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank. "This may indicate that the world's financial markets arebecoming bubbly, driven by excess liquidity. Asset prices couldrise further if European problems stabilise, which would probablymean a rise in cross/yen as well as a fall in dollar/yen." The dollar has fallen almost 10 yen since the end of 2009. OnWednesday it was going nowhere at 83.74 yen, sandwiched betweenbids under 83.50 and offers above 84.50. In the near term there are strong expectations of range-boundtrade, with one-month implied volatility on dollar/yen fallingbelow 9.5 percent, the lowest since late 2007. The U.S. currency fared better against sterling, which took ablow from news of a record British borrowing requirement andslipped to a near three-month low of $1.5463. The dollar index slipped 0.2 percent to 80.54, which marks again of 3.4 percent for the year but still leaves it more than 9percent below the June peak of 88.708. The United States and Britain are due to release their latestestimates of gross domestic product (GDP) for the third quarter.U.S. growth is seen likely to be revised up to an annualised 2.8percent, from 2.5 percent previously. More importantly, recent upbeat data on consumer spending hasled analysts to sharply lift their forecasts for growth thisquarter, while the surprisingly aggressive package of tax cutsagreed this month has boosted estimates for all of 2011.
