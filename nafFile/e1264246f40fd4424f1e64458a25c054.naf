<raw><![CDATA[ * Says solution needed to $5 billion Icesave debt dispute * Says Dutch also to lobby IMF for repayment * Iceland President: Landsbanki estate should cover payout (Adds Dutch FinMin quote, background, Iceland president) AMSTERDAM, April 12 (Reuters) - The Netherlands will blockIceland's bid to join the European Union unless a dispute over$1.3 billion on unpaid debts is resolved, the Dutch financeminister said on Tuesday. Jan Kees De Jager also said he wanted to lobby theInternational Monetary Fund, which has been giving aid toIceland to help it recover from economic meltdown, to make surethe money was repaid. In a referendum on Saturday, Icelanders rejected for asecond time a plan to repay a total of $5 billion to Britain andthe Netherlands in debts from a bank crash. [nLDE73900H] Both countries said they would take Iceland to court. "A satisfactory solution of this problem needs to be inplace... That is a precondition for entry," Dutch FinanceMinister Jan Kees de Jager told parliament. "We want to get the IMF aligned as much as possible to makesure there is an irreversible obligation for Iceland to meet itsagreements," De Jager said. In London, Iceland's President Olafur Grimsson said Britainand the Netherlands likely did not need to go to court torecover the $5 billion they could be repaid out of the bank'sestate. The debt was incurred when the two countries compensatedtheir nationals who lost savings in online Icesave accountsowned by Landsbanki, one of three Icelandic banks that collapsedin late 2008, triggering economic mayhem. The island of 320,000 people started membership talks withthe EU last year, but popular enthusiasm for the 27-nation blochas faded because of the row with Britain and Netherlands.[ID:nLDE66Q26A] The government of Johanna Sigurdardottir has said a freshround of talks on further funding from the IMF would be delayedseveral weeks due to the 'No' vote in the referendum. De Jager reiterated a solution to the debt problem was nowin the hands of the court of the EFTA Surveillance Authority(ESA), the European trade body overseeing Iceland's cooperationwith the European Union.
