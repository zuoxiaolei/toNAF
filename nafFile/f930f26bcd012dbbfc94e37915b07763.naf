<raw><![CDATA[ * S&P revises its credit outlook on U.S. to negative * Potential Greek debt restructuring in focus * Finnish vote adds concerns about euro zone bailouts (Updates prices, adds details, comment) NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - Worries over Europe's debtcrisis spurred a sell-off in global stocks and the eurocurrency on Monday, with a downgrade of the U.S. credit outlookfurther battering investor confidence. Growing unease about the possibility of Greecerestructuring its debt and the rise of an anti-euro party inFinland exacerbated anxiety over how European policy-makerswill handle the region's festering debt and bank problems. Rating agency Standard & Poor's revised its outlook on theUnited States to negative from stable, citing a "material risk"that policymakers may not reach agreement on a plan to trim itslarge budget deficit. See [ID:nN18195555] While the agency maintained the country's top AAA creditrating, it said the move signals there's at least aone-in-three chance that it could cut its long-term rating onthe United States within two years. "On a day when sovereign debt troubles have returned tohaunt the euro, S&P's announcement added salt to the wound,"said Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT in New York."Investors were risk averse going into the NY open and will nowremain cautious or nervous throughout the North Americantrading session." MSCI's all-country world stock index started what is in many places a holiday-shortened week bylosing 1.7 percent. Wall Street stocks fell sharply. The Dow Jones industrialaverage  dropped 196.02 points, or 1.59 percent, to12,144.34. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  dropped 19.18points, or 1.45 percent, to 1,300.11. The Nasdaq CompositeIndex  dropped 5.18 points, or 1.82 percent, to2,714.28. In Europe the FTSEurofirst 300  was off 1.8percent. The fall wiped out the European index's gains thisyear, leaving it in negative territory for 2011. In a weekend election, Finnish voters handed the anti-euroTrue Finns party a crucial role in parliament and possibly apath into government. Finland's parliament has the right to vote on EuropeanUnion requests for bailout funds, meaning it could in theoryhold up costly plans to shore up Portugal and bring stabilityto debt markets. [ID:nLDE73G02L] [ID:nHEL010101] Talk about Greek debt restructuring has also boiled up inrecent weeks, including a Greek newspaper report on Monday thatthe government had asked the International Monetary Fund andEuropean Union to start discussions on a restructuring.A Greek finance ministry source said the report was nottrue. [ID:nATH006025] [ID:nLDE73H0DR] Disappointing earnings and concerns about Japan's comingreporting season further eroded appetite for stocks and otherrisky assets. Gold and silver hit new record highs. The euro hit a 2-week low against the dollar on concernsabout Greek restructuring and the Portuguese bailout. It fell1.2 percent to $1.4357 , paring losses briefly againstthe dollar after the S&P downgraded its outlook on the UnitedStates. The dollar lost 0.7 percent to 82.54 yen, after hitting asession low of 82.48 yen, the weakest in more than two weeks. In the bond market, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which rises when there are jitters about U.S.credit-worthiness, rose 5 basis points to 4.52 percent.
