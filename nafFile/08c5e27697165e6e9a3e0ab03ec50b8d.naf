<raw><![CDATA[  * Euro hits lows on Greece concerns, ECB rate outlook * Euro on track for worst 1-day loss vs dollar in a month * Broad flight from risk hurts euro; oil, stocks down (Updates prices, adds quotes, details, changes byline) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - The euro fell for a thirdstraight day against the dollar on Friday, with more lossesviewed as likely, weighed down by wranglings about how tohandle Greece's debt crisis and diminished expectations abouteuro zone rate hikes. The euro was on track for its worst daily performance in amonth and was down 1.9 percent for the week. A broad-based flight to safety stemming from worries aboutthe global economic recovery also dragged down the euro andother currencies that typically rise in times of increased riskappetite. Greece also heightened the markets' aversion to risk asinvestors received mixed messages about the progress offinancial assistance to the debt-ridden country. Germany stuck to its demand that private investorscontribute to a second bailout, even as the European CentralBank was opposed to any form of debt restructuring. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet again indicated onThursday the bank would not roll over its own Greek bondholdings. He also suggested that the ECB might not be willingto accept Greek bonds as collateral from banks seeking loans ifsome form of restructuring made the bonds ineligible under ECBrules.

"The market has seen a broad sell-off in risk, and I haveto blame Trichet, who on Thursday pretty much assured Greekdebt restructuring fails by stating the ECB would not take partin a rollover of Greek debt so long as that event was a creditevent or event of default," said David Gilmore, a partner at FXAnalytics, in Essex, Connecticut. In early afternoon trading, the euro fell as low as$1.43220 on trading platform EBS  and was last at$1.43437, down 1.1 percent on the day. Against the yen, the euro fell as low as 114.940, itsweakest level since May 27. It last traded at 115.200, down about 1.2 percent on the day."Until some clarity about Greece emerges, the euro willprobably continue to suffer," said Mark McCormick, currencystrategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. Greece's bond yields rose by 60 basis points, with theshort end of the curve leading the sell-off. Reuterscalculations from Markit show 5-year credit default swapsreflect a 74 percent default probability based on a 41 percentrecovery rate. See [GVD/EUR] The uncertainty should continue next week, analysts said,with a high risk that consensus is not reached before a June 20euro-zone finance ministers' meeting, which will discuss waysto secure more funding for Greece. That was a pre-condition fora vital disbursement of the next tranche of its current bailoutin July. "Seems like a slow motion Lehman event is again unfoldingin the euro zone, and policy response is not going to get infront of the problem ... Helmets are mandatory next weekdespite the hot weather," said FX Analytics' Gilmore.Other stories on euro zone debt crisis  [ID:nLDE68T0MG]Graphic on Europe's debt crisis http://r.reuters.com/hyb65p ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Apart from the Greek drama, reduced rate expectations alsohurt the euro. The ECB on Thursday kept its 2012 inflation forecastunchanged, suggesting the pace of euro-zone interest-rate hikesmay be slower than previously thought. Trichet cemented the market's view that the ECB will raiserates in July, but another hike is not priced into the marketuntil early 2012.  The dollar was little changed against the yen at 80.32 yen The ICE dollar Index , which tracks the greenbackagainst a basket of currencies, rose 0.9 percent to 74.844.
