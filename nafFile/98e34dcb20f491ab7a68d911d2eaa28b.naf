<raw><![CDATA[ (Refiles to fix typos in final quote)  WASHINGTON, June 10 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury SecretaryTimothy Geithner said on Thursday that reform of China'sexchange rate is "critically important" to the U.S. and globaleconomies and a more flexile yuan was in China's interest. Geithner, in testimony prepared for a hearing of the U.S.Senate Finance Committee, said Beijing's shackling of the yuanto the dollar was causing other Asian countries to intervene inforeign exchange markets at record levels. "The distortions caused by China's exchange rate spread farbeyond China's borders and are an impediment to the globalrebalancing we need," Geithner said. "A more flexible RMB(yuan) will allow market forces to play a more active role overtime in facilitating strong balanced and sustainable growthglobally."
