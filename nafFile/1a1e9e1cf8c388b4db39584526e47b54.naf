<raw><![CDATA[  * Dollar having worst day vs euro since mid-July * Strong Chinese data boosts risk appetite, Aussie gains * No yen intervention, focus shifts to Japan party race * Longer-term concerns linger, Swiss franc up vs dollar(Updates prices, adds comment, Swiss, Swedish exchange rates) By Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - The dollar headed for itsbiggest daily slide against the euro in two months on Monday asstrong Chinese data boosted currencies of countries likeAustralia that are big sellers to China. Thanks to recent better-than-expected U.S. employment dataand new global banking rules, investors began the week in anupbeat mood about the world economy. New data showing Chinesefactories ramped up production last month and money growth beatexpectations backed the view markets had grown too gloomy intheir outlook. Investors were also cheered when regulators agreed on newcapital requirements for banks on Sunday, with lenders givenmore time than expected to comply with them. That helped drive the euro above $1.28 -- it fell below$1.26 in late August -- leaving it on track for its best dailygain since July 15. The high-yielding Australian dollar reacheda five-month peak of $0.9362. Australia is a top supplier ofraw materials for China. "There's no doubt that risk appetite has returned, and thestrong Chinese data reduces the risk of a global double-diprecession," said Matthew Strauss, senior strategist at RBCCapital Markets in Toronto. The euro was up 1.5 percent at $1.2860. Earlier gainstriggered automatic buy orders around $1.2750, and its break ofits 55-day moving average at $1.2815 drove it still higher. Itrose 1 percent to 107.80 yen. The euro also got a boost after the European Commissionsaid it expects the euro zone economy to grow almost twice asfast in 2010 as previously thought. Analysts said the euro was targeting $1.2920, a level itfailed to breach earlier this month, but warned it would remainwithin its recent range unless it topped that level. But analysts said longer-term worries remain about U.S.growth and the health of the euro zone banking sector. Thatpushed the dollar down 1 percent to 1.0088 Swiss francs. Thefranc is a traditional safe haven currency. "People are getting short-term encouragement from recentdata but still have long-term concerns," said Brian Dolan,chief strategist at Forex in Bedminster, New Jersey. The Swedish crown, meanwhile, hit a 2010 high of 7.1405 pereuro, driven partly by expectations that the Riksbank will hikerates before the European Central Bank. YEN SLIPS, CHINA IN FOCUS The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 83.81 yen, near a 15-yearlow around 83.34 yen. That kept investors on alert to seewhether Japanese authorities would intervene to weaken the yenahead of a ruling party leadership vote Tuesday. If challenger Ichiro Ozawa ousts Prime Minister Naoto Kan,analysts expect the dollar to rise against the yen, as Ozawahas advocated strong intervention to curb the yen's strength. Traders said bids from Japanese importers around 83.50-80yen were offset by exporter offers reported above 84.20 yen. Were Japan to intervene, it is expected to act alone, withU.S. authorities more focused on persuading China to allow moreyuan appreciation. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was due to discussChina's exchange rate practices before Congress this week. In remarks published in the Wall Street Journal on Monday,he said China has made "very, very little" progress on lettingthe exchange rate reflect market forces. China loosened the yuan's peg against the dollar in June,but the dollar has only fallen about 1 percent since then.
