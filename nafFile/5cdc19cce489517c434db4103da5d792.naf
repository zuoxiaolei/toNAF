<raw><![CDATA[ * China data fuels hopes of soft landing * U.S. retail sales fall less than expected in May * Global stock markets advance, euro strengthens * Greece sells T-bills; 10-year debt yield at record high (Updates market action, adds byline, analyst quote) By Richard Leong NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - Encouraging Chinese and U.S.economic data lifted stocks, oil and other growth-orientedmarkets on Tuesday, while Greece managed to raise cash in adebt auction even after it became S&P's lowest-rated sovereignborrower. Chinese data showing the world's second biggest economycould avoid a hard landing amid efforts to prevent it fromoverheating renewed the market's appetite for risk. This alsoboosted oil, gold and other commodity prices but put downwardpressure on low-risk government bonds. China's inflation accelerated to its fastest level inalmost three years, and its industrial output grew a solid 13percent from a year ago. Its central bank, in an effort to curbinflation, later increased the reserve requirement ratio forcommercial lenders by 50 basis points. For details, see[ID:nL3E7HE05P] While the data showed inflation at multi-year highs, it didnot stoke fears that it is running beyond the control ofpolicy-makers. "News out of China is somewhat encouraging in spite of thefact they raised reserve requirements," said Peter Cardillo,chief market economist at Avalon Partners in New York. He said the data is a sign that perhaps China's economy"can avoid a hard landing, and that's cheering the markets." In the United States, retail sales fell for the first time11 months, but the drop was less than expected, signalingresilience of American consumers despite sluggish job growthand a lousy housing market. For more, see [ID:nN14189765] The U.S. stock market advanced with the Dow Jonesindustrial average  was up 131.01 points, or 1.10percent, at 12,083.98. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 16.04 points, or 1.26 percent, at 1,287.87. The NasdaqComposite Index  was up 37.41 points, or 1.42 percent,at 2,677.10. Top European stocks  rose 1.15 percent, whileTokyo's Nikkei  ended up 1.0 percent. GREECE SELLS DEBT Also reducing investor anxiety was Greece's ability toraise short-term funds after Standard & Poor's downgraded itsrating closer to default territory. [ID:nN13126859] Greece sold 1.625 billion euros ($2.33 billion) of 6-monthT-bills at a yield of 4.96 percent. This was higher than May's4.88 percent but attracted a larger percentage of foreignbuyers than the previous auction, reflecting marketexpectations Greece will secure a second rescue package worthabout 120 billion euros to stave off default. The cost of insuring Greek debt against default over fiveyears rose, as did the yield on Greek government bonds, to arecord high. Greece's trials did little to discourage investors frombuying the euro. The euro rebounded a day after it hit a record low againstthe Swiss franc . The Swiss currency, which fallswhen markets feel less need for a safe haven, declined morethan 0.8 percent versus the euro and the U.S. dollar. The euro weakened against the greenback at $1.4226 afterthe less grim U.S. retail sales report after gaining 0.1percent earlier. . Meanwhile, investors channeled money into commodities atthe expense of government bonds. ICE Brent July crude  rose $1.50 to $120.63 abarrel, while U.S. oil futures  were up almost 1 percentat $98.22. Spot gold  rose to $1,522.06 an ounce from $1,514.73on Monday when it suffered its biggest one-day loss in a month,touching a three-week low of $1,511.11. A sell-off in the U.S. government bond markets pushedbenchmark yields to their highest level in almost two weeks at3.07 percent. German Bund futures fell 0.59 basis points at125.37 after posting a contract high of 126.11 on Monday.
