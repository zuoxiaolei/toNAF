<raw><![CDATA[ * EU leaders want IMF to pursue financial transaction tax * No specific mention of heavy tax on bankers' bonuses * Deal reached on financing for global climate deal   (Adds news conference, deal on climate change)     By David Brunnstrom and Timothy Heritage BRUSSELS, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The European Union urged theInternational Monetary Fund on Friday to pursue a global tax onfinancial transactions to limit the risk of another economiccrisis, despite U.S. opposition. EU leaders also underlined the need for "sound andeffective" financial sector pay at a two-day summit but, withthe notable exception of Germany, did not broadly support Frenchand British proposals to tax bankers' bonuses heavily. Although the leaders of the 27-nation bloc largely revivedexisting ideas, they signalled a desire to address voters'outrage over a return of the big bonus culture in the bankingsector so soon after it was bailed out with tax payers' money. "The conclusion ... is to propose a global financialtransaction levy. It wouldn't be fair that some impose veryheavy burdens and others don't," Jose Manuel Barroso, presidentof the executive European Commission, told a news conference. "I think it makes sense that a sector that created such aproblem for our economies, our taxpayers ... also makes acontribution to the overall economy," he said after two days oftalks in Brussels. The IMF is already considering how to limit risk in thefinancial system after the worst economic crisis in generations,but Washington has opposed calls for a so-called Tobin Tax --named after U.S. economist James Tobin -- on financialtransactions. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for considerationof such a tax at a summit of the Group of 20 developed andemerging nations last month, saying the proceeds could be usedto fund future financial bailouts. But he faced opposition from U.S. Treasury Secretary TimothyGeithner, who said he was against such a tax as a way to dampenrisky bank behaviour [ID:nN07223447] Without worldwide support, experts say it would be doomed tofailure. Brown acknowledged this, telling reporters in Brussels:"Global taxes will not be introduced unless all global financialcentres are able to come behind it. But I believe there'sgrowing support for that."

The British government said on Wednesday banks operating inBritain would be charged a 50 percent tax rate on employees'bonuses of above 25,000 pounds ($40,610). French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said PresidentNicolas Sarkozy planned to announce a windfall tax on bankingbonuses "equivalent" to the 50 percent levy proposed by Britain. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the IMF should examinethe issue of taxing bankers' bonuses and expressed sympathytowards the idea of restricting excess bonuses but added thatGerman tax law was complex on the issue. Despite the lack of overt backing, Sarkozy said he expectedothers to follow the example of Paris and London. "I see now there is a string of heads of state who arejoining, or have intentions to join, because today it's clear.It's done. The times are changing and once again our twocountries are at the head of that change," he said.  SOLIDARITY WITH GREECE Lagarde said the need for close cooperation had also beenhighlighted by the difficulties facing countries in the group of16 countries that use the euro."We're at a decisive turning point for Europe and the eurozone," Lagarde told reporters in Paris. Greece has particularly bad problems. Greek bonds and sharesfell sharply after credit rating agency Fitch downgraded Greekdebt this week but Prime Minister George Papandreou dismissedsuggestions that Athens could leave the euro zone. "We are cutting the deficit with systemic changes and we areplanning to do this within four years. It is a very clearprogramme and we are absolutely determined to do so," Papandreoutold Reuters in an interview in Brussels. Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, head of theEurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, said he was confidentthe Greek government would rein in public finances. "I have to say I don't see the risk of state default inGreece," he said. Despite the problems facing the EU, the leaders pledged toprovide 2.4 billion euros annually for the next three years tohelp developing countries tackle global warming before any dealagreed at talks in Copenhagen takes effect.
