<raw><![CDATA[ * UK Q3 GDP shrinks 0.2 percent qq vs previous -0.3 percentestimate * Q2 GDP revised down to -0.7 percent from -0.6 percent * Household spending shows first qq growth since Q1 2008 * Household saving ratio highest since 1998  (Adds Reuters BoE poll, context) By David Milliken and Fiona Shaikh LONDON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Britain's economy shrank by 0.2percent in the third quarter, only a fraction less thanpreviously thought, but a long-awaited rise in householdspending suggests the 18-month downturn may be nearing an end. Although Britain is trailing most major economies inemerging from recession, analysts reckon it will rebound in thefourth quarter with growth of around 0.4 percent.  "Upward revisions to consumer spending and investmentsuggest that the economy is stabilising," said Andrew Goodwin,senior economic advisor to the Ernst & Young ITEM Club. "The further significant draw-down of inventories meansthere is plenty of room for a turn in the stock cycle to supportgrowth over the next few quarters," Goodwin added. All but one of the 53 analysts in a Reuters poll reckon theBank of England will halt its quantitative easing programme whenthe current 200 billion pound ($320 billion) asset purchasefund, intended to help keep credit flowing, runs out in the nextfew weeks. Monetary Policy Committee member Adam Posen said in anewspaper interview on Tuesday that the policy had helped staveoff a deeper downturn, but noted risks to growth were stillskewed to the downside. Indeed, a breakdown of Tuesday's gross domestic product(GDP) data showed that while construction output reboundedstrongly in the third quarter, the effect was negated bydownward revisions to industrial and services output.  RECORD RECESSION RECEDING Much of the downturn has been caused by companies slashinginventories and consumers tightening their belts.  So a sharper fall in inventories of 4.6 billion pounds and arise in the household saving ratio to a decade high of 8.6percent suggested to some economists that the bulk of thisprocess may now be over. "It's an encouraging sign that the worst of the adjustmentis now behind us -- so the headwinds against growth in comingyears from consumer deleveraging should be limited," saidNeville Hill, economist at Credit Suisse. However, others are not so optimistic. "The scything instocks may reflect a large degree of pessimism about futuredemand which, if justified, could presage a rather wanrecovery," said Simon Hayes, economist at Barclays Capital. The Office for National Statistics said total economicoutput has fallen by 6.03 percent since Britain enteredrecession in the second quarter of 2008, confirming the sharpestdecline since quarterly records began in 1955 and just exceedingthe 6.00 percent drop between 1979 and 1981. Britain's Conservative opposition has profited from the weakstate of the economy in the run-up to a national election due byJune 2010, while the Labour government is hoping that a quickrebound will improve its chances at the polls. Activity surveys, like the CIPS/Markit purchasing managers'indices, are pointing upwards and house prices have been rising. Unemployment in Britain has been surprisingly subduedcompared with previous recessions and other major economies,which will also help. And there were some signs in Tuesday's data that parts ofthe economy had already turned the corner, helped by record-lowinterest rates and government measures to stimulate demand. Household spending rose 0.1 percent between July andSeptember, its first rise since early 2008, and real householddisposable income was 1.2 percent up on the quarter and 5.2percent up on the year, the biggest annual rise since 2001. In another sign that the economy is shifting away from itsdependence on consumption-led growth and easy credit, exportsrose 0.8 percent on the quarter -- the first rise in more than ayear. There was also positive news on Britain's current account deficit, which was just half analysts' expectations at 4.703billion pounds in the third quarter.  The second quarter deficit was revised down sharply to 4.375billion pounds from an earlier estimate of around 11.4 billionpounds due to revisions to historic data on trade in services,cross-border Value Added Tax fraud, and insurance and shipping.
