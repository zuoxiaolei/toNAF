<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro holds near 2-mth highs on easing debt concerns * Resistance seen at $1.2767 and then at $1.2780 * Aussie holds previous day's gains, U.S. earnings help By Masayuki Kitano TOKYO, July 14 (Reuters) - The euro held steady near atwo-month high against the dollar on Wednesday, withhigh-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar supportedby a seemingly significant improvement in risk appetite. The dollar could come under more pressure, especially againsthigher-yielding currencies, in reaction to robust U.S. corporateearnings. Intel Corp reported results above expectations and gave anupbeat sales outlook, pushing S&P futures higher. Traders said funds were increasingly moving out of cash andlow-yielding U.S. Treasuries to buy euro and growth-relatedcurrencies. Helping drive sentiment was a strong start to theU.S. corporate earnings season and easing concerns about eurozone's sovereign debt and the financial sector. The euro was little changed from late U.S. trading on Tuesdayat $1.2710. It hit a two-month peak of $1.2739 on Tuesday,brushing aside a Moody's downgrade of Portugal's sovereign ratingby two notches. Instead, investors chose to pay more heed to the strongresponse to a six-month treasury bill tender by Greece. Thedebt-laden country sold 1.625 billion euros ($2.03 billion) ofT-bills at a better rate than it pays to borrow under a EuropeanUnion/International Monetary rescue fund. For more see. "What we are seeing is that cash is being put back to workwith all the negative news surrounding the euro zone receding,"said Greg Gibbs, currency strategist at RBS, Sydney. "Some of the risk premium that was being attached to the eurozone is being taken off. The downgrade of Portugal was very muchexpected and I think we could see the euro rise a bit more fromhere." Chartwise, resistance is seen at $1.2767, the target of anA-B-C wave sequence starting from the euro's four-year low of$1.1876, with the C-wave starting at $1.2152. The next target comes in at $1.2780, which is a 50 percentretracement of its fall from mid-April to the June low. The euro rose 0.3 percent against the yen to 113.18 yen,hovering near a three-week high of 113.29 yen hit earlier. The yen was broadly under pressure and retreated against thedollar, which rose 0.3 percent to 88.96 yen, with talk ofstop-loss bids above 89.25 yen. The yen, considered to be a safe-haven investment, is usuallysold off when risk appetite improves. The dollar index was almost unchanged at 83.619, havingbroken trendline support. New support is seen around 83.15, the38.2 percent retracement of the the index's November to Junerally.  Other major U.S. corporates to report quarterly earningsthis week include JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp.  Some traders expressed doubts about whether the improvementin risk appetite would last, saying it could worsen again if U.S.banks' quarterly earnings come in weak.  Akira Hoshino, chief manager for the Bank ofTokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ's foreign exchange trading department,reckons U.S. economic indicators such as the Philadelphia Fed'sbusiness activity index due later in the week could be key.  "Markets have pulled back up after having tried to factor inpretty far in advance an economic slowdown and deflation,"Hoshino said, adding that such concerns could come to the foreagain.  Sterling rose 0.3 percent to $1.5218. Earlier in thesession, it scaled a two-month peak of $1.5245 after data onTuesday showed quarterly consumer price inflation remained abovethe Bank of England's 2 percent target rate.     The Australiandollar hit a three-week high of $0.8851, though it later slippeda tad to around $0.8827 on light profit-taking, with resistanceat the June high of $0.8860, and also at levels near $0.8880 to$0.8885. The 100-day moving average and 61.8 percent retracement ofits April 12 to May 25 slide are near such levels.
