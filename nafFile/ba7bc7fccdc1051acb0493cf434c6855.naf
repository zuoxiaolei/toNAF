<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The U.S. dollar was mixed against its other major currencies on Wednesday, ahead of a key interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve and following disappointing data on new U.S. home sales.During European afternoon trade, the greenback was up against the euro, with EUR/USD shedding 0.27% to hit 1.2238.Earlier in the day, the Census Bureau said sales of newly built single-family U.S. homes fell to a 300,000 unit seasonally adjusted annual rate during May, from 446,000 in April, whose figure was revised down from 504,000.Economists had expected a more modest decline to 450,000 in May.Also Wednesday, official data showed that while activity in France's services sector increased at a faster rate than forecast in June, activity in Germany’s manufacturing sector fell at a faster rate than forecast during the month. The greenback was also up against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF gaining 0.32% to hit 1.1112.Meanwhile, the greenback was up against its Australian and Canadian counterparts, with AUD/USD shedding 0.26% to hit 0.8695 and USD/CAD shooting up 1.33% to hit 1.043.But the greenback was down against sterling, with GBP/USD rising 0.52% to hit 1.4893.The greenback was also down against the yen and the New Zealand dollar, with USD/JPY shedding 0.5% to hit 90.13 and NZD/USD jumping 1% to hit 0.711. The kiwi’s gains came after official data showed that New Zealand’s current account unexpectedly posted a surplus in the first quarter.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.16%.Later in the day, the Fed was expected to leave its benchmark interest rate at a record low and reiterate a pledge to leave it there for some time, in light of the fragile U.S. economic recovery and ongoing threats posed by Europe's debt crisis, high unemployment and a frail housing market.             ]]></raw>
