<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro zone service sector growth eases * Firms pass on rising costs to customers * Indian, Chinese services PMI bounce higher * U.S. PMI seen higher  By Jonathan Cable LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - Euro zone service sector companieseased off the accelerator slightly last month but ratcheted upprices, while Indian firms also turned up the heat, according tothe latest business surveys to show inflation is on the rise. Businesses in the United States are also expected to haveperformed strongly, while Chinese services-based companies grewat their fastest pace in 11 months in April, despite a raft ofpolicy tightening measures imposed in recent months by Beijing. But growth is coming at a cost, with output price indexes inclosely-watched purchasing managers' surveys hitting new highsacross the world as firms increasingly pass rising costs fromsoaring commodity and energy prices on to customers. "The PMI confirms that for now at least it is stillconsistent with pretty healthy growth in the euro zone. They(prices) have been at high levels for some time now and thatwill be of a concern," said Ben May at Capital Economics.The Markit Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers' Index,which measures changes in the activity of euro zone companiesranging from banks to restaurants, slipped to 56.7 in April fromthe previous month's near 4-year high of 57.2. That marked its 20th month in a row above the 50 mark thatdivides growth from contraction. Expansion was again dominated by Germany and France, whichmasked virtual stagnation in Spain and slowing growth in Italyand Ireland. Separately, euro zone retail sales fell sharply in March,pointing to weaker household demand, as soaring prices and harshausterity measures weighed on consumers' minds. The biggest monthly decline in sales was in Portugal, wherethe government secured a 78 billion euros bailout on Tuesday butwill be expected to cut debt sharply in return. Data due next week is expected to show the 17-nation bloc'seconomy grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter, a modest step upfrom the lacklustre 0.3 percent expansion seen in the lastmonths of 2010. Markit said that if sustained, the latest PMI figures wereconsistent with quarterly growth of around 0.8 percent in thesecond quarter of the year. Data later in the day is expected to show the U.S. servicessector, which accounts for 80 percent of the world's largesteconomy, expanded slightly faster last month than in March. The Federal Reserve said last week the economy was clawingback from its deep recession at a "moderate pace" and showed itwas in no rush to change its ultra-loose policy, despite somesigns of inflation pressures building.  PRICE PRESSURES The euro zone's output price index rose to 53.0 last month,its highest level since July 2008 and up from March's 52.3, asfirms grew increasingly confident about passing on soaring inputcosts to customers. The figures will bolster those policymakers at the EuropeanCentral Bank who believe the strong recovery in Europe's coreeconomies calls for more interest rate rises before inflationbecomes entrenched, even while weaker euro zone states remainengulfed in the debt crisis. Data released on Friday showed consumer prices in the blocrose 2.8 percent year-on-year in April, up from March's 2.7percent and well above the ECB's two percent target ceiling. The ECB holds a rate-setting meeting on Thursday, havingraised rates for the first time in two years last month. Thenext tightening is expected in June or July. "They need to hike because of the growth of the corecountries in Europe like Germany. They can't sustain this verylow interest rate and emergency measures," said Jan Dubsky atRBS. Earlier on Wednesday, a comparable survey showed India'sservices sector gained momentum in April, with strong growth innew business orders despite stubbornly high inflation andexpectations of further interest rate increases. The Reserve Bank of India raised rates for the ninth timesince March 2010 on Tuesday in a bid to rein in stubborninflation that rose to nearly 9 percent in March, above thecentral bank's target of 8 percent. China's PMI for its services sector, published on Tuesday,rose to an 11-month high of 62.5 in April from 60.2 in March.
