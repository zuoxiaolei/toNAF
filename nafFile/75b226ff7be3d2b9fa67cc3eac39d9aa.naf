<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro recovers vs dollar; traders eye Ecofin meeting * Greek uncertainty caps gains as EU ministers press Greece * Stocks, commodities rise, risk demand rises slightly (Adds comment, updates prices)  By Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The euro edged up against thedollar on Tuesday, recovering some of its recent losses astraders reckoned the single currency's battering in past weeksover Greek public finance issues may have gone too far. Gains were limited, however, due to uncertainty over whetherGreece's debt problems will be resolved quickly, as investorsawaited developments at a meeting of European Union financeministers on Greece on Tuesday. [ID:nLDE61F0XT] Sentiment towards the single currency remained broadlynegative, and market participants said the euro would bevulnerable to further falls. "There's been a relief bounce, as you could argue that theeuro was a bit oversold," said Kenneth Broux, market economistat Lloyds TSB in London. He said the euro's rise against the dollar was a repeat ofmovements last week, when it gained in the run-up to a pledge byEuropean leaders to support Greece, although a lack of concretedetails on the assistance ultimately triggered more selling. "The market seems to be hoping for some clarity from theofficials (later today), but it's running the risk ofdisappointment again," he said, adding he favoured selling theeuro into any rally. Euro zone states urged Greece on Monday to take furthersteps to control its budget deficit by mid-March if needed, butdid not elaborate on last week's EU pledge. [ID:nLDE61E29L] At 1204 GMT, the euro  was up 0.4 percent on the dayagainst the dollar at $1.3655, but hovered in range of Friday'snine-month low of $1.3532. Some in the market said an early rise in global stockmarkets and commodity prices suggested a slight recovery in riskdemand and was helping to support the euro. "Markets are in a state of fatigue at the moment. There is alack of fresh news and what news there is has already beenpriced in," said UBS currency strategist Geoffrey Yu.  MORE LOSSES AHEAD? Analysts said the single currency remained highly sensitiveto any more negative news on Greece. The euro has shed nearly 10 percent against the dollar sincelate 2009 on worries over the fiscal health of Greece and othereuro zone countries, such as Portugal. This increased the number of net euro short positions to arecord high last week, according to the latest data from theCommodity Futures Trading Commission. The dollar index  <=USD> was down 0.3 percent at80.099, below a seven-month high of 80.748 hit late last week. Markets showed limited reaction to a ZEW survey showingGerman economic sentiment fell for the fifth straight month inFebruary, although not by as much as expected. [ID:nDEG005625] Traders said the euro was also helped higher against theU.S. dollar in tandem with the Australian dollar and otherperceived riskier currencies after Australia's central banksignalled further gradual interest rate rises. [ID:nSYC002309] But the Australian currency outshone the euro, hitting adecade high of A$1.5241 , while it also hit itsstrongest vs the dollar in more than two weeks at $0.8877. Against the yen, the euro  gained 0.4 percent to122.83 yen, while the dollar  was steady at 89.93 yen. (Additional reporting by Jessica Mortimer, editing by NigelStephenson)             ]]></raw>
