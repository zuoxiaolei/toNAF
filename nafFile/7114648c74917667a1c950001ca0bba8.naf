<raw><![CDATA[(For other news from the Reuters China Investment Summit,click on http://www.reuters.com/summit/ChinaInvestmentSummit09) * China consumers of growing interest * South Korea trade growth with China to stay fast * S.Korea needs to keep tech advantage over China By Jonathan Thatcher SEOUL, Aug 31 (Reuters) - China's booming consumer market isa growing focus for South Korean exporters, who are moreaccustomed to their giant neighbour as a major production basefor sales to other countries, Trade Minister Kim Jong-hoon said. But while links with South Korea's biggest trade partner willcontinue to grow quickly, Seoul has its work cut out to maintaina technological edge over China whose pursuit of world markets is"very threatening", Kim told the Reuters China Investment Summit.  "In 1992, when we established diplomatic relations, thetwo-way trade volume between Korea and China was only $5 billion.In 2008, (it) grew up to $170 billion. That means it increased 34times in the last 16 years. This is an incredible growth intrade." He forecast the figure would exceed $200 billion this year, agrowth trend that would continue. "As the Chinese economy keeps growing, at a pace of 8 percentlately, and people there get better off, I think there's a bigchange in the Chinese economy from a simple production base to aconsumption market," Kim said. He noted that in 2001 China absorbed just over 4 percent ofglobal exports, an amount that by last year had risen to 7percent. The surge has been accompanied by increasing localisationthere of South Korean companies, which have so far invested morethan $35 billion in the world's third-biggest economy. South Korea, Asia's fourth-largest economy, which has seenits competitive edge in labour-intensive industries eroded byChina, still has a technological lead in areas such as flat panelscreens, memory chips, autos and mobile phones. It also has good opportunities to invest in China's ambitiousinfrastructure development such as high speed trains, nuclearplants and green energy, Kim said. On top of that, it can offer its expertise in the financialsector, including insurance and investment banking. There has been criticism in Chinese media of overnightclosures by South Korean companies, leaving their local employeesand suppliers unpaid. But Kim, though acknowledging the problem, said it haddiminished significantly and that the vast majority of SouthKorean firms were there for the long-haul. There were 85 cases in 2007, mostly around the Chinesecoastal city of Qingdao. So far this year, the number is 11, Kimsaid. "It has pretty much stabilised," he said, adding it was nolonger a serious point of contention between the two countries. Commenting on the mounting competition from China in emergingmarkets, Kim said it was a strong threat that meant South Koreaneeded to keep investing in research and development, especiallyin the wake of the latest economic crisis. He noted that some academics put the technology gap betweenthe two economies at only 3-5 years, with fierce rivalry in suchindustries as shipbuilding. But for the moment, Kim said, South Korean businesses stillhave the upper hand in controlling quality, marketing andafter-sales service. (Editing by Ken Wills)             ]]></raw>
