<raw><![CDATA[ * U.S. dollar drops; euro may test $1.3950 area * ECB meets on Thursday, may sound hawkish on inflation * Swiss franc hits record on Middle East, Africa turmoil (Updates prices) NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a nearfour-month high against the dollar on Wednesday and looked setto extend gains on growing expectations interest rates in theeuro zone will rise earlier than those in the United States. The Swiss franc soared to a record high against the dollaras escalating tensions in Libya and fears of contagion to otheroil-rich countries, especially Saudi Arabia, prompted investorsto seek safety in the Swiss currency. For details, see[ID:nLDE721009] The European Central Bank holds its policy meeting onThursday. With oil prices trading above $100 a barrel  and euro zone inflation well above target, investorsexpect the ECB to sharpen its anti-inflation rhetoric. After struggling in recent sessions to break aboveresistance at $1.3862, its previous 2011 high, the euro piercedthat level as North American trading got underway. The euro could make a run toward $1.40 should post-meetingcomments from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet reinforceexpectations of an interest rate hike, analysts said. "The perception is growing in the market that the ECB willcertainly be hiking rates sooner than the Fed and that hasreally underpinned the euro for the time being," said GregSalvaggio, senior vice president of capital markets at TempusConsulting in Washington. The euro  climbed as high as $1.3890 on tradingplatform EBS, its strongest level since Nov. 9. It last tradedat $1.3869, up 0.7 percent on the day. Euro zone producer prices rose in January at the fastestrate in the history of the single currency, data showed onWednesday, highlighting the risk that the ECB may raise ratessooner than expected. [ID:nLDE7210ZT] Traders reported option-related offers ahead of $1.39.Further upside targets include $1.3947, around the 76.4 percentretracement of the euro's fall from November to January, and$1.3958, the 200-week moving average. The dollar index , which tracks the greenback againsta basket of major currencies, fell to as low as 76.529, itslowest since early November 2010. EURO AS SAFE-HAVEN The U.S. currency has been unable to benefit from therecent spike in risk aversion amid political tensions in theMiddle East and North Africa, prompting some investors toquestion whether the dollar has lost its safe-haven status. "People are starting to view the euro as a counter to thedollar in times of turmoil simply because they both offer equalsecurity. However, the euro is offering higher yields,"Salvaggio said. The dollar has come under pressure as investors focused onthe view that higher oil prices would push other central banksto raise interest rates to combat inflation even as the FederalReserve maintains its stimulative monetary policy. Investors also fret that rising energy costs could hurtU.S. consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds ofthe U.S. economy. However, some analysts said if tensions escalate, concernsabout the impact of soaring oil prices on the global economycould sour investor appetite for risk and help the dollarregain its safe-haven status. "If there is no resolution to the crisis in the MiddleEast, oil prices will stay elevated and people will stopfocusing on the inflationary impact. The euro is in favor nowbut in two to three weeks it could be the dollar," said SimonDerrick, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon. The dollar was little changed at 81.89 yen , afterfalling as low as 81.57 yen on EBS, a near one-month low. Thegreenback hit an all-time low of 0.9202 Swiss franc on EBS andwas last down 0.5 percent at 0.9237 . Some traders said the dollar could get a respite if U.S.non-farm payrolls jobs data for February, due on Friday, comesin stronger than expected, bolstering the case for the FederalReserve to wind down its $600 billion bond-buying program. U.S. private-sector employers added more jobs than expectedlast month, data showed on Wednesday. [ID:nN02213101]             ]]></raw>
