<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar falls vs euro after U.S. trade and jobless data * Aussie, kiwi gain on rate hike prospects after jobs, RBNZ * Greece, Spain worries still weigh on investors * BoE holds rates, SNB keeps FX intervention threat  (Recasts, updates prices, adds details, adds comments) NEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against theeuro for the second straight day on Thursday after anarrower-than-expected U.S. trade deficit for October and someimprovement in jobless claims, reducing safe-haven demand forthe greenback. Ongoing concerns over the fiscal health of Greece and Spaincapped gains on the single currency however. Standard & Poor'scut Spain's credit outlook to negative on Wednesday, a dayafter Fitch downgraded Greece's credit rating, sparkingconcerns about sovereign debt. The Australian and New Zealand dollars both rose on growingexpectations of higher interest rates. "The continuing claims rolled off quite a bit, and theycame in about almost 300,000 below what the market was lookingfor," said Jacob Oubina, currency strategist at Forex.com inBedminster, New Jersey. "And the trade balance in the U.S. alsoimproved considerably. A positive for the risk trade." The euro was last up 0.2 percent at $1.4758. The dollar wasup 0.3 percent at 88.13 yen though off the session peak of88.45 yen. ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said Thursdaythe current worries about Greece's finances would not split theeuro zone "The euro has probably taken a bit of a hit from theseinternal problems in the euro zone," said Johan Javeus,currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm. The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $32.94 billion in Octoberfrom a revised $35.65 billion in September, the governmentsaid. Economists expected a deficit of $36.8 billion for themonth. The latest trade numbers finally reflect the positiveimplications of a weaker dollar, said Kathy Lien, director ofcurrency research at GFT Forex. U.S. trade with China wasparticularly strong, with exports reaching a record $6.9billion, "which tells us that the U.S. is also a beneficiary ofthe recovery in China." The U.S. Labor Department reported continuing claims, orthe number of workers collecting jobless benefits after aninitial week of aid, fell to 5.157 million in the latest weekfrom a revised 5.46 million in the prior week. STRONG AUSTRALIA JOBS DATA Strong Australian jobs data fueled anticipation that rateswill rise further in Australia, and the Reserve Bank of NewZealand signaled its rates may go up sooner than thought. The Australian dollar added 0.9 percent against the dollarto $0.9170, while the New Zealand dollar gained 1.4 percent to$0.7286, hitting its highest level in a week, with bothbolstered by expectations interest rates will rise.      Gainsin the currencies prompted analysts to speculate the market maybe switching from the recent trend of trading on risksentiment, which has seen the euro tend to gain in tandem withhigher-yielders like the Australian dollar. "Interest rates are becoming a more important factor, andthe market is looking more at fundamentals now," said You-NaPark, Commerzbank analyst in Frankfurt. Sterling was up 0.4 percent against the dollar at $1.6316,but barely budged after a widely expected decision by the Bankof England to hold interest rates at a record low 0.5 percentand keep its asset-buying program unchanged. The euro was little changed against the pound at 90.59pence . The Swiss franc dipped briefly after the Swiss NationalBank (SNB) held interest rates steady and stuck to its pledgeto fight an appreciation of the franc decisively. This was tempered, however, as the bank dropped its offerto buy corporate bonds, the first signs it was easing drasticstimulus measures, and as SNB chairman Jean-Pierre Roth saidthe franc had stayed stable versus the euro. The euro briefly rose to a session high around 1.5134francs, according to Reuters data, before dipping to around1.5112, little changed on the day.             ]]></raw>
