<raw><![CDATA[   * U.S. stocks end higher on economic data, Buffett's view * World stocks gain 0.7 pct, set for 3rd monthly rise * Dollar at 3-1/2-month low ahead of Fed chief's testimony * Brent crude oil dips for day, but up 10.7 pct for month (Updates to U.S. markets' close) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stock markets rose onMonday on encouraging economic data and after optimisticcomments from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, while thedollar hit a 3-1/2-month low against a basket of majorcurrencies. World equities, measured by the MSCI All-Country WorldIndex , added 0.8 percent, after rising 1.1percent on Friday. The global index is up 2.4 percent thismonth, on track for a third straight monthly rise. The dollar slid against a currency basket ahead of U.S.Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony beforecongressional committees on Tuesday and Wednesday. Brent crude oil futures edged lower for the day as moreproduction from Saudi Arabia helped offset supply disruptionsdue to turmoil in Libya. For the month, though, Brent crude oil prices surged 10.68percent -- the biggest percentage gain since May 2009, whenprices soared 29 percent. It touched a 29-month high near $120a barrel last week. On Wall Street, investors' mood got a lift from someupbeat economic data and a positive outlook from Buffett. An index of U.S. Midwest business activity roseunexpectedly in February, according to the Institute forSupply Management-Chicago, while U.S. personal income shot up1 percent in January, Commerce Department data showed. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc , toldshareholders in his widely read annual letter that he sees theneed for "major acquisitions," a sign stocks may be cheap.Berkshire's Class B  shares rose 2.8 percent to$87.28. [ID:nN26170376] [ID:nN27180671] Ventas Inc  said it will buy Nationwide HealthProperties  for $5.8 billion in a stock deal thatstrengthens its position as the biggest U.S. owner of seniorhousing. NHP shares jumped 9.7 percent to $42.74. "We expect M&A activities to dramatically accelerate thisyear," said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A.Davidson & Co in Lake Oswego, Oregon. S&P 500 UP 3.2 PCT FOR MONTH James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve,also gave stock investors reasons to be optimistic with hiscomments that the U.S. economy should do well in 2011 and oilprices are not currently a drag on the recovery. U.S. stocks racked up a third month of gains. Thebenchmark Standard & Poor's 500  rose 3.2 percent forthe month, while the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial averagegained 2.8 percent and the Nasdaq added 3 percent. The market has defied expectations for a major correction,despite rallying since September. The S&P 500 is up 26 percentsince the start of September. The dollar, however, came under pressure on expectationsthat Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, in testimony to congressionalcommittees later this week, will stick with his recenteconomic assessment that the recovery is strengthening, butnot enough to bring about a significant improvement in thejobs market. The Dow Jones industrial average  gained 95.89points, or 0.79 percent, to end at 12,226.34. The S&P 500advanced 7.34 points, or 0.56 percent, to finish at 1,327.22.The Nasdaq Composite Index  added 1.22 points, or 0.04percent, to close at 2,782.27. Limiting the Nasdaq's advance was a downgrade by UBS ofonline retailer Amazon Inc  to "neutral" from "buy,"due to higher costs. Amazon was down 2.2 percent at $173.36. VOLATILE OIL AND GOLD ABOVE $1,400 Brent crude oil prices were volatile, following a spikelast week on worries over supply disruption from the MiddleEast and North Africa. Brent crude  slipped 34 cents tosettle at $111.80 a barrel. The uprising in Libya has cut as much as three-quarters ofthe country's oil output, prompting Saudi Arabia to step inand plug the supply gap to Libya's oil buyers. The gains raised worries about its effect on the globaleconomic recovery. "If oil prices rise further, it will restrain economicgrowth. But with no further escalations, at current levels itisn't going to cause a recession," said Jason Pride, directorof investment strategy at Glenmede Investment and WealthManagement in Philadelphia. Spot gold  stayed above $1,400 an ounce, reflectinginvestors' safe-haven bid due to turmoil in the Middle Eastand North Africa. DOLLAR SLIPS BEFORE BERNANKE SPEAKS The U.S. dollar fell versus a currency basket as investorsspeculated that this week Fed chief Bernanke will signalcontinued support for the central bank's quantitative easingprogram. Bernanke is scheduled to testify before key congressionalcommittees on Tuesday and Wednesday. Expectations are that hewill reiterate his view of an economic recovery that is stillnot strong enough to significantly reduce the jobless rate,suggesting the time is not ripe for U.S. interest rates torise. The ICE futures exchange's U.S. dollar index , whichtracks the greenback's performance against a basket of majorcurrencies, was down 0.5 percent. Earlier, the index hit itslowest level since Nov. 9. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed, with Federal Reservepurchases and subdued consumer spending in January seen assupportive. Commerce Department data showed U.S. consumer spending wasweaker than expected, down 0.1 percent in January, the firstdecline in a year. The yield of the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note stood at 3.42 percent, unchanged from late lastweek.  "Look for (investors) to have 'one foot' in the Treasurymarket, and 'one foot' in something offering a higher return,as investors go back and forth, depending how the wind blowson some key global issues," said Kevin Giddis, president offixed income capital markets at Morgan Keegan in Memphis,Tennessee. According to fund tracker EPFR Global, a growing aversionto risky assets in the latest week fueled the biggest flows toglobal bond funds in more than three months, and turned moreinvestors away from emerging market stocks. [ID:nN25262438] The rotation out of emerging markets into developedmarkets, partly driven by inflation concerns in emergingeconomies, has led to outperformance in developed markets. TheMSCI emerging market index  has lost 4.2 percent thisyear. Credit Suisse's private bank expected the fund rotation toease in the second quarter. In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  of top shares closed 0.8 percent higher at 1,169.24points.
