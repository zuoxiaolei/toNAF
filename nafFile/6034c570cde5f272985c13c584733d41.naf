<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro under broad selling pressure, Greece jitters remain * Euro hits 10-yr low vs Aussie, tumbles vs SEK, NOK * EU pledge to help Greece short on details, analysts say (Adds comments, updates throughout; previous TOKYO)  By Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Friday,staying under pressure after a pledge by the European Union tohelp Greece tackle its fiscal problems did little to quelluncertainty surrounding ballooning Greek sovereign debt. EU nations on Thursday offered their solidarity and supportto help Athens rein in its deficits, a message that was echoedby the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bankon Friday. [ID:nSGE61B027] [ID:nLDE61B07H] Still, a lack of details on what will be done to help Greecekept investors jittery, resulting in widening yield spreadsbetween benchmark government bonds in Greece and Germany --widely considered the safest in the euro zone.  That helped push the euro down across the board, striking adecade low against the higher-yielding Australian dollar at A$1.5313 and plumbing its lowest level against theSwedish and Norwegian crowns since autumn 2008. "The EU's intentions are good, but the market would likedetails," said Kasper Kirkegaard, currency analyst at Danske inCopenhagen. "Until we get more details on a political solution forGreece, the euro is going to stay under selling pressure." Concern over how Athens will service its debt has hammeredthe euro -- it is trading near a 8 1/2-month low versus thedollar, having fallen nearly 10 percent since late 2009.  By 0905 GMT, the euro  had fallen half a percent onthe day to a day's low of $1.3609, closing in on $1.3585, itsweakest since May 2009 which it hit earlier this month. Investors were awaiting euro zone fourth-quarter economicdata due at 1000 GMT after data released earlier on Fridayshowed German growth stalled in October-December, while Frenchgrowth grew 0.6 percent. Ongoing uncertainty about Greece kept investors risk-averseon currencies, boosting the dollar across the board as a safehaven. Against a currency basket , it rose 0.4 percent to80.290, hovering near a seven-month high of 80.683 hit earlierthis month. The Swiss franc bumped lower in early European trade,pushing the euro  more than 50 ticks to a day's highof 1.4695 francs, while the dollar jumped to 1.0794 francs fromaround 1.0750. The Swiss National Bank declined to comment on the suddenmove in its currency. [ID:nLDE61B0K] As Greece's fiscal woes continue to hang over the market,investors await meetings early next week between EU financeministers, although analysts said that might still be too earlyto expect much clarity on what steps the bloc would take to helpGreece tackle its debt. [ID:nLDE61A0W2]  "There will still be a lot of questions hanging around,"said Gareth Berry, currency analyst at UBS in Singapore.   "The EU have no experience of this type of thing. They are notthe IMF and they will be very careful not to plunge into thiswith both feet and not think things through."
