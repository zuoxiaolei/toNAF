<raw><![CDATA[ By Jane Sutton MIAMI, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Bill Clintonsaid on Sunday he would lead an international trade mission ofprivate investors to Haiti in October to pursue energy andother development amid signs the nation is stabilizing. Clinton burnished his credentials as an elder statesmanlast week when he visited North Korea to retrieve two Americanjournalists who had been held in the communist-ruled Asiannation and met with its reclusive leader Kim Jong-il. He did not mention North Korea during Sunday's speech tothe Haitian Diaspora Unity Congress in Miami. In his first major address to the Haitian diaspora sincebecoming U.N. special envoy to Haiti, Clinton said stabilityhad improved in the troubled Caribbean nation, providing newopportunity for foreign investment. "I think we are really on the verge of being able to makesome significant changes," Clinton said. Deeply impoverished Haiti was plagued by coups and sporadicunrest for much of the 1980s and 1990s. U.N. peacekeepingforces have been helping maintain order in the Caribbean nationsince the last revolt in 2004. But United States, Canada and other nations have recentlyeased their travel warnings for Haiti in recognition ofimproving security, while the Haitian government hasstreamlined the approval process for business ventures, Clintonsaid. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund grantedHaiti $1.2 billion of debt relief in June, helping ease itsfinancial burden. Clinton said his investor mission would focus onagriculture, construction, textiles and energy, citing examplesthat ranged from increasing Haiti's mango exports to developingaffordable fuel. Electric power is scarce in rural areas and the cutting oftrees to make charcoal has led to deforestation in Haiti. As an example of projects rife for further investment,Clinton described a recycling program that turns paper andsawdust waste into cooking fuel that sells for one-fifth thecost of charcoal. Clinton also said Brazilian investors who he did notidentify had expressed interest in expandingsugarcane-to-ethanol production to new areas outside Brazil,and that it was "a real possibility" for Haiti. He also promised to "hector every last dime" out of donornations that had yet to deliver money they pledged for Haiti.  (Editing by Bill Trott)             ]]></raw>
