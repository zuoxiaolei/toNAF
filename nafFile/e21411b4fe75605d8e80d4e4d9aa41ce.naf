<raw><![CDATA[ * Republican Bunning in new showdown with Democrats * Job "too important" to go unfilled, senator says * Delay has fueled criticism of U.S. at WTO By Doug Palmer WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - A Republican senator whoheld up action earlier this month on a bill to renew joblessbenefits faced more criticism  on Wednesday for blockingapproval of President Barack Obama's nominee to be U.S.ambassador to the World Trade Organization. Senator Jim Bunning, a Kentucky Republican, has delayed  the Senate from approving Michael Punke to be ambassador to theWTO in Geneva. This has fueled criticism that the United Statesis not fully engaged in the Doha round of world trade talks,which have already dragged on for eight years. "This job is too important to remain open because onesenator has a flimsy policy beef," said Senator Jon Tester, aDemocrat from Montana, complaining on the Senate floor aboutBunning. "Our trading partners use his absence as an excuse to stallprogress on serious negotiations," said Tester, whosefrustration with the delayed nomination is shared by the Obamaadministration. Both Punke and Isi Siddiqui, Obama's choice to be chiefU.S. agricultural trade negotiator, won unanimous backing fromthe Senate Finance Committee in December. MOVED TIED TO CANADA SMOKING LAW But Bunning, who is a member of the Finance Committee, hasused his right under Senate rules to block further action onboth nominations. He is stalling in an effort to put pressureon the Obama administration to prod Canada to change parts ofits anti-smoking legislation. "To fully represent the interests of the United States intrade negotiations we need everybody on our team at the table,"Nefeterius McPherson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. TradeRepresentative's office said. "A year into this administration, USTR and the presidentdeserve to have these nominees in place," she said. Bunning delayed Senate action for about a week on a bill tofund jobless benefits, highway construction and othergovernment programs until his fellow Republicans worked out adeal to allow the legislation to move. The tobacco-state senator, before he turned his attentionto Punke and Siddiqui, previously blocked a Senate vote onMiriam Sapiro to be deputy U.S. trade representative. His colleagues sidestepped Bunning and approved Sapiroalong with a long list of other nominees on Dec. 24, when theKentucky senator was absent for votes. Bunning then placed a hold on Siddiqui and Punke. "The reason Senator Bunning gives for his hold? He wantsCanada to repeal parts of the anti-smoking law that they passedin the Canadian parliament. I don't think that holds water,"Tester said. There was no immediate response from Bunning's office toTester's speech. WTO Director General Pascal Lamy was in Washington  on Wednesday for talks with U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirkand other top U.S. officials. His visit came one day before Obama will give a speech onthe importance of boosting U.S. exports to create jobs. (Reporting by Doug Palmer; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)             ]]></raw>
