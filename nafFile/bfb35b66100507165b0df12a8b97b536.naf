<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro firmed against the dollar on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and expanded its quantitative easing by USD45 billion to stimulate the U.S. economy.In U.S. trading on Wednesday, EUR/USD was trading up 0.65% at 1.3090, up from a session low of 1.2996, and off from a high of 1.3097.The pair was likely to find support at 1.2996, the earlier low, and resistance at 1.3127, the high from Dec. 6.The U.S. Federal Reserve is currently running a round of quantitative easing, a monetary stimulus tool that sees the U.S. central bank buy USD40 billion in mortgage-backed securities a month from banks on an open-ended basis to spur recovery, and going forward, the Fed will purchase an additional USD45 billion in Treasury holdings to spur recovery.Such policy tools send stocks rising by design to encourage investing and job creation, which weakens the greenback as a side effect.The additional Treasury purchases will take place of the Fed's so-called Operation Twist program, under which the Fed swaps USD45 billion a month in short-term Treasuries for long-termer U.S. government debt.Operation Twist will expire at year end.Benchmark interest rates remain unchanged at a target 0.25% though the Fed stressed they will stay that way until unemployment rates make major improvements."The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored," the Fed said in a statement.Elsewhere in Europe, official data revealed that industrial production in the euro area fell 1.4% in October, down for a second successive month and off from a 2.3% gain in September.Analysts were expecting industrial production to gain 0.2%.Meanwhile in Italy, borrowing costs fell to the lowest levels since March despite Prime Minister Mario Monti's surprise decision to step down once a 2103 budget is in place.The country's Treasury sold EUR6.5 billion in 364-day bills at 1.456%, down from 1.762% during a previous auction last month.In the U.K., the Office for National Statistics reported earlier that claims for unemployment benefits in November declined by 3,000 from October, beating forecasts for a gain to 7,000.The country's unemployment rate remained unchanged at 7.8%, in line with expectations. The dollar did see earlier support against the yen ahead of Sunday's elections in Japan, where a victory for the Liberal Democratic Party, which markets view as likely, would usher in looser policies at the Bank of Japan.The euro, meanwhile, was up against the pound and up against the yen, with EUR/GBP trading up 0.34% at 0.8098, and EUR/JPY trading up 1.41% at 108.84.On Thursday, markets will focus on U.S. data on retail sales, a leading indicator of consumer spending, as well as data on producer price inflation and the weekly government report on initial jobless claims.Meanwhile, the ECB is to release its monthly bulletin, which contains insights into the economic outlook from the bank’s perspective.             ]]></raw>
