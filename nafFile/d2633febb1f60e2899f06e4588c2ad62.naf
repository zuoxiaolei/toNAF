<raw><![CDATA[ (For related story, double-click on [ID:nSEO170410]) Sept 17 (Reuters) - The Bank of Korea has rattled the bondmarket and the country's finance ministry by signalling it isready to increase interest rates to calm a surge in houseprices. That has boosted the prospect that the Bank of Korea couldbe the first G20 central bank to tighten policy during thefinancial crisis. The central bank's position, laid out by Governor LeeSeong-tae last week, has led to a rare public spat with thefinance ministry, which is urging caution by saying the economyis not ready for higher rates and remains exposed to many risksfrom the global downturn. Here are five facts about Lee: -- Lee is a career central banker. Born in 1945, he joinedthe central bank at the age of 22 and was handed a four-yearterm in the top job in 2006. He graduated from South Korea'sprestigious Seoul National University and earned a master'sdegree in economics from the University of Illinois. Tradersdescribe him as calmer than his predecessors, a trait theyattribute in part to his stints in the central bank's mediarelations and research departments. -- Korean bond futures fell the most in three months lastThursday after remarks by Lee following a Bank of Korea meetingin which he raised concern about rising house prices and said:"There can be cases in which the policy is deemed to be on aneasing bias even after interest rates are raised." -- It would not be the first time that Lee has raised ratesto counter rising house prices. He led a campaign lasting morethan two years until late 2008 to raise interest rates by 125basis points to a record high of 5.25 percent to control aproperty boom. -- Lee is willing to exert central bank independence fromthe government. Just last week he said the final decision onmonetary policy rests with the central bank. While the centralbank is by law independent, it is also obliged to implementpolicy "in harmony" with government economic policies. Still,the central bank has traditionally come under strong governmentpressure to support its policies. Many analysts say Lee hasroom to side-step government pressure now and start raisinginterest rates before it might want him to because his termends in six months. He has the casting vote on any ratedecision. -- It would not be the first time that Lee has come intoconflict with the government. Financial markets speculated in2008 that he was at odds with the government shortly afterPresident Lee Myung-bak took office early that year, hoping fora quick cut in interest rates to give a push to growth. At thetime, the government was using all possible policy tools toboost the economy, but the Bank of Korea later raised rates.
