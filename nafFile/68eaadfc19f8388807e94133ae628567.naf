<raw><![CDATA[EUR/USD remained on pace for a positive week after gaining more than 0.5% to 1.0987Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose sharply to remain on track for a positive week, as the potential for a Grexit from the euro became even more remote on Thursday after a critical Greek vote passed in Parliament during a late-night session.The currency pair traded between 1.0922 and 1.1018 on Thursday before settling at 1.0987, up 0.0058 or 0.53%. Despite the solid gains throughout the week, the euro is still down more than 3% against its American counterpart over the last month.EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0808, the low from July 20 and was met with resistance at 1.198, the high from July 13.On Wednesday evening, the Greek Parliament ratified two critical measures required by Greece's euro zone creditors to reopen bailout talks. More than a week after Parliament passed an initial package of four measures needed to trigger new discussions, the legislative body approved the latest measures by a 230-63 vote in a late-night session. Five MPs abstained and two others were absent. The action enables Greece and its international creditors to revive negotiations on a three-year â‚¬86 bailout.In the U.S., the Department of Labor said in a weekly report that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless claims for the week ending July 18 fell by 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 255,000. With the unexpected decline, initial filings fell to its lowest level in more than 40 years. Analysts expected the figure to drop by 1,000 to 280,000.Investors await next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting for further clues on the timing of the U.S. central bank's first interest rate hike in more than a decade.

It came days after Fed chair Janet Yellen reiterated that conditions in the economy are likely to justify an interest rate hike at some point this year.The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell to an intraday low of 96.97 before rallying to 97.31, down more than 0.4% on the session.
