<raw><![CDATA[  * European bond proposal initially lifts risk appetite * Stocks, euro waver as debt crisis remains uncontained * U.S. debt prices rise as safe-haven appeal returns (Adds fresh prices) By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The euro and world equitiesstruggled to eke out gains on Wednesday as efforts by Europeanleaders to cap the region's escalating debt crisis failed toquell investor fears. Early optimism over steps to create euro zone bonds faded,causing equity markets and the euro to see-saw. A delay instarting a scheduled conference call among German, French andGreek leaders added to investors' angst and a topsy-turvymarket. "There's a fair degree of uncertainty ahead of those debttalks," said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at TravelexGlobal Business Payments in Washington. U.S. government debt prices rose on the market uncertainty,even as stocks on Wall Street and the euro recovered afterretreating earlier in the session. The euro bounced off of session lows after Austria'sfinance ministry said a vote over upgrading the EuropeanFinancial Stability Facility -- the euro zone's bailout fund --which an Austrian parliamentary committee failed to approve,would win legislative backing. The euro last traded at $1.3705 , up 0.2 percenton the day. Wall Street also rebounded. The Dow Jones industrial average  was up 12.33points, or 0.11 percent, at 11,118.18. The Standard & Poor's500 Index  was up 3.35 points, or 0.29 percent, at1,176.22. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 16.02points, or 0.63 percent, at 2,548.17. MSCI's all-country world equity index rose 0.1 percent, andEurope managed to close higher. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares finished up 1.5 percent at 913.62points. U.S. Treasuries edged higher. Benchmark 10-year notes rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.0 percent. Moody's Investors Service downgraded two of France'slargest banks, but the ratings cut was smaller than expectedand did not include a third bank, as many had feared.[ID:nL3E7KE09F] Investors backed away from their initial enthusiasm overcomments by the president of the European Union's executivebody, who said it was presenting options for euro area bonds.Investors surmised it may not be enough to snuff the crisis.
