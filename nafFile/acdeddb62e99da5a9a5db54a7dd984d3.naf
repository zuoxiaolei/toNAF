Gold hit a record high on speculation that U.S. governmentstimulus would quicken inflation, while the prospect of morecash flowing through the system boosted stocks and currenciesin developing economies that are outperforming Europe and theUnited States. The Fed said on Tuesday it stood ready to pump new dollarsinto the economy -- a second round of so-called quantitativeeasing. The central bank made no policy shift, but investors,understanding the economic situation was eroding, sold stocksto book profits built this month, analysts said. European and Wall Street shares drifted lower as investorswere torn between expectations for Fed help and its message ofa faltering recovery. They were also uncertain if Fed moveswould be enough to ward off a double-dip recession. "Investors are realizing things will have to deterioratefirst in the economy before the Fed is going to intervene,"said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas FortisGlobal Markets in Brussels. The Dow Jones industrial average  dropped 21.72points, or 0.20 percent, at 10,739.31 and the Standard & Poor's500 Index  fell 5.5 points, or 0.48 percent, to 1,134.28.The Nasdaq Composite Index  slipped 14.80 points, or0.63 percent, to 2,334.55.

The Thomson Reuters global stock index declined 0.3 percent. Investors' major concern in Europe remained the levels ofgovernment debt. Persistent worries about Ireland's fiscaldeficit pushed the spread of its 10-year bond yield over GermanBunds to euro lifetime highs of 4.25 percentage points. Ireland's borrowing costs jumped at a bond auction butappetite for its bonds as well as Spanish and Greek debt wasenough to lift their bond markets. Despite austerity measures in Ireland, investors demandedhigher yields on its bonds because of worries about the cost ofbailing out its banks, and the toll that economic troublescould take on tax revenues. The dollar  fell 0.8 percent to a six-month lowagainst major currencies. The euro rose as high as $1.3440 , its strongestsince April, as traders believing in the success of Fedstimulus took on risk.

"It looks like the hurdle for (quantitative easing) hasbeen lowered, and the Fed is more concerned about the inflationpicture," said Nick Stamenkovic, rate strategist at RIACapital, who added that the Fed may act as early as November. Yields on benchmark U.S. Treasuries fell to their lowestlevels in three weeks as traders extended a rally from Tuesdaywhen the Fed raised prospects of more quantitative easing.
