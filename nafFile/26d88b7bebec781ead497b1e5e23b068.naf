<raw><![CDATA[ * No comment on Kurdish offer of talks to Baghdad-DNO * Analysts say long period of discussions ahead * Shares as high as 20 percent on hopes for "breakthrough"deal  (Adds more analyst comment, background) By Wojciech Moskwa OSLO, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Shares in Norwegian oil producerDNO jumped as much as 20 percent on Monday on renewed hopes foran Iraqi oil export deal, even though analysts said  Baghdad andKurdish authorities still had a long way to go. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) said on Sunday itwas "willing to enter a serious dialogue" with Baghdad over oilexports and might publish contracts signed with foreign oilcompanies to demonstrate its transparency. DNO said on Monday its contract with the KRG had beenpublished but declined to comment further on the developments. A deal between the two sides is crucial for DNO. It has setup production in Iraqi Kurdistan but has halted exports due tothe ongoing disagreement between the Arab-led government and thesemi-autonomous Kurdish authorities over revenue sharing. "This could be the breakthrough," said Arctic Securitiesanalyst Trond Omdal. "There is still uncertainty about what thenew regime will look like, but these developments are positive,"referring to the parliamentary elections slated for March. Shares in DNO rose as high as 20 percent and were up 15.2percent to 6.14 crowns at 1225 GMT after a brief suspension waslifted by the Oslo bourse. However, analysts said while renewed discussions between theKRG and Baghdad would be a step in the right direction, the roadto DNO winning an export license was still long. "This is a complicated issue and it will take time," saidone analyst, who asked not to named. DNO was the first foreign company to drill for oil in Iraqafter the 2003 U.S.-led invasion to oust Saddam Hussein, but hasso far not been able to capitalise fully on its trailblazerstatus, mainly due to political delays to getting approval forexport from Kurdistan. In a presentation published last week, DNO reiterated underits outlook for 2010 that it sought to "resume Tawke (field)export sales once payment procedures are in place".  DNO had exported as much as 50,000 barrels per day from itsTawke site in Iraqi Kurdistan in mid-2009 under a temporary dealbetween the KRG and Baghdad, but has still not been paid for itsexports. Tawke production has been turned down and is now soldlocally. Analysts said markets had not priced in the chances for anyoil deal before Iraq holds the election in March and that thelatest price surge could be a reassessment of hitherto slimhopes for any quick deal with the Kurdish authorities. Baghdad's hand was strengthened recently against the Kurdswhen Iraq secured agreements with international oil companies todevelop oilfields south of the KRG border. If successful, those deals could boost Iraqi national outputto 12 million bpd, rivalling top producer Saudi Arabia, from 2.5million bpd now, making Kurdish crude exports less important fora government that relies almost entirely on oil for revenue.
