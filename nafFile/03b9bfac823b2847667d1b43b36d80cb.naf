<raw><![CDATA[ * South Korean swaps ease, pare excess rate hikeexpectations * Aussie rate swaps slide after weak retails sales data * Dollar funding rates at another record low By Umesh Desai HONG KONG, Sept 9 (Reuters) - South Korean interest rateswaps eased on Wednesday, extending their recent decline as themarket pared expectations of aggressive rate hikes and amidhopes of an improvement in liquidity conditions. In Australia, bill futures jumped and swaps fell after asurprise drop in retail sales had the market scrambling toreduce chances of an early rate rise there. The Australian market has now factored in only a smallpossibility of a rate increase in October, compared with aone-in-three chance on Tuesday. It still has priced in around80 percent chance of a 25 basis point rate increase inNovember. The cost of borrowing dollars fell in Asia on confidencequantitative easing measures put in place by major centralbanks will remain until signs emerge the global economicrecovery is real and sustainable. In Singapore, 3-month dollars dropped to 0.30667 percentfrom 0.30813 percent. It is down over 5 bps this month. South Korean one year interest rate swaps fell 3 basispoints to 3.26 percent. It has fallen 15 basis points since thestart of the month. Five year swaps declined by 4 bps to 4.29 percent and thespread over the one year contract is down one bps to 1.03percent, although the curve is expected to steepen as the shortend is seen paring early rate hike expectations. "In Korea the market has taken rate hikes a little bit toofar and there is some room for yields to come down," said JensLauschke, rates strategist with DBS Baank in Singapore. "Its too early to start hiking rates as it would derailrecovery, so we need to see more data before Bank of Korea canhike rates," he said. The South Korean central bank looks certain to hold itsbase rate at a record low of 2.0 percent at its meeting onThursday, but expectations of a rate hike in 2009 have risensignificantly, a Reuters poll showed. Lauschke, who expects the central bank to "remainaccommodate way into 2010," said the recent tightness inliquidity which also contributed to a rise in swaps was seeneasing after measures aimed at slowing down bank lending. The government added to tightening lending rules on Mondayby telling banks to base the size of housing loans on theborrower's income, not the property's value. This follows last week's decision to impose adebt-to-income regulation for banks' mortgage lending and afterthe lowering of loan-to-value ratio in July. "The adoption of these non-monetary measures may indicatethat policymakers are reluctant to tighten monetary policy toosoon and run the risk of hurting the recovery," said Lauschke. South Korean Finance Minister Yoon Jeung-hyun said onWednesday it would be premature to implement an exit strategynow and any withdrawal would need to be carried out in agradual manner. That is expected to calm the market which has seen thebenchmark 3-month CD rate jump to 2.57 percent, its highestsince February this year and indicating it has factored in atleast a 25-basis-point rate increase by year-end. Australian one year interest swaps dropped 12 bps to 4.12percent and December bill futures jumped 0.12 points to 96.15after a drop in retail sales fuelled concerns about theresilience of consumer demand. "This suggests that the RBA may well take a patientapproach to the start of a tightening cycle, awaiting moredomestic data," said Su-Lin Ong, strategist with RBC CapitalMarkets. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has made it clear thecurrent cash rate of 3 percent is an "emergency" level and willhave to be adjusted upward should the economy continue tostrengthen as expected. The market now anticipates 178 basis points of tighteningwithin the next 12 months, down from Tuesday's high of 200bps. (Reporting by Umesh Desai; Editing by Kazunori Takada)             ]]></raw>
