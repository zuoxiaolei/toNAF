<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar recovers vs euro, trade still very thin * Aussie and kiwi hold on to gains * U.S. data underwhelms investors (Recasts, adds quotes, updates prices) NEW YORK, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The dollar traded higheragainst the euro and the yen on Tuesday, after recovering fromearly losses against the single currency, as holiday-thin trademade moves more volatile. Traders and analysts warned against drawing too manyconclusions from intra-day movements, noting that a few largetrades can completely alter the direction of the day's trade. "The dollar is struggling to find a direction at the end ofthe year," said John Doyle, foreign exchange strategist atTempus Consulting in Washington. "There is a lack of liquidityand any major buyer can move the market." U.S. data released on Tuesday, including consumerconfidence data, confirmed the U.S. economy is improving butfailed to overwhelm investors. Some traders said a Moody's downgrade of Abu DhabiCommercial Bank ratings to A1/D-plus from Aa3/C-minus prompteda flight to safety in the greenback. Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar,up earlier in the session when improved risk appetite was thecentral trading theme, held on to gains but were off sessionpeaks. Midway through the New York session, the euro was down 0.3percent at $1.4340, well off the session peak of $1.4458 andclose to the session low of $1.4433. The dollar index, a non-traded gauge of the greenback'sperformance against six major currencies, rose 0.3 percent to77.884, in sight of a 3-1/2-month high touched last week. Traders earlier said the U.S. currency may struggle to risemuch further after speculators have finished covering shortdollar positions. Data on Monday showed speculators were long in the U.S.currency for the first time since May, ending 32 straight weeksof short dollar positions. Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.4 percent to 91.97 yen,with a session high of 92.03 yen, a two-month peak.     Traderssaid upward pressure on long-term Treasury yields is providingsupport to the dollar against the yen after U.S. governmentbonds traded lower on Monday and pushed the benchmark 10-yearnote yield to its highest level in nearly five months. The dollar showed little reaction to the Federal Reserve'sproposal on Monday to create a new mechanism, a "term depositfacility," to help the U.S. central bank withdraw money fromthe banking system when Fed officials decide to tightenmonetary policy. There was limited reaction to the Standard &Poor's/Case-Shiller indexes report on Tuesday showing U.S. homeprices were unchanged in October, dashing hopes for a sixthstraight monthly increase. The Australian dollar was up 0.8 percent at US$0.8943,after earlier touching a 12-day peak. The New Zealand dollargained 1.3 percent to US$0.7172.
