<raw><![CDATA[  * Dollar keeps bid tone as Egypt's Mubarak steps down * Dollar rises to 1-month high vs yen, Swiss franc * Bond yields still a significant factor in FX (Recasts; updates  prices, adds quote) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose againstthe euro on Friday, shaking off a brief dip after EgyptianPresident Hosni Mubarak stepped down as investors have widelypriced in his exit and technical factors weighed on the singlecurrency. The euro, which hit a three-week low against the dollar onFriday, has tried to break the $1.35 level twice before andfailed, shifting momentum to the downside. In addition, the recent spate of U.S. economic data hasbeen supportive of the greenback and most strategists arelooking for more outperformance on the dollar. "It was a kneejerk reaction and it didn't last becausethere are bigger things driving the euro right now," said BrianDolan, chief currency strategist, at Forex.com in Bedminster,New Jersey. "Egypt is now seen as a regional political drama and themarket seems to think the risk of a fundamentalist takeoverthere is overblown. But the concerns most heavily weighing onthe euro -- the ongoing debt crisis -- are still there, and fornow, the downside is still in play," he said. In midday New York trading, the euro fell 0.4 percent totrade at $1.3540, after earlier hitting $1.3502 -- its lowestsince Jan. 21. Key support for the euro lies at $1.3500, apoint that traders cited as an options barrier, with reports ofstrong bids ahead of that level. Technical analysts said if the pair closes below the euro's100-day moving average at $1.3542, it would be the first timesince Jan. 17. As a result, the single euro zone currency couldsee further downside. The ICE Futures' dollar index, which measures thegreenback's performance against a basket of currencies, was up0.3 percent at 78.522. Traders said the European Central Bank stepped in to buyPortuguese bonds after yields on the country's debt hiteuro-era highs. The latest spike in yields has sparked freshconcerns about funding costs in peripheral euro zoneeconomies. Bond yields have also been driving the price ineuro/dollar, with spreads between two-year U.S. Treasuriescatching up to their Bund counterparts, supporting thegreenback, said Andrew Busch, global currency strategist at BMOCapital Markets in Chicago. He said the two-year U.S. Treasury/Bund spread peaked inlate January at around 89 basis points, but has since narrowedto 60 basis points or less, which Busch said was a big deal. The dollar, meanwhile, touched its highest level in a monthat 83.68 yen, boosted by the rising trend in U.S. Treasuryyields. It was last up 0.3 percent at 83.51 yen. Some analystssaid the spike in yields reflects a U.S. economy on a morefooting. The dollar also made headway against the Swiss franc,rising to a one-month high at 0.9750 on demand from a Swissbank. The franc was further undermined on weaker-than-expectedSwiss inflation data released Thursday. The dollar was last at 0.9762, up 0.7 percent.             ]]></raw>
