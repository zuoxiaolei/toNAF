<raw><![CDATA[ * Debt office sees 53 bln SEK 2010 deficit vs pvs 64 bln * Sees less severe downturn in labour market * Says borrowing plans remain largely unchanged * Swedish debt yields rise as issue volumes kept unchanged  (Adds analyst comment, market reaction) By Niklas Pollard and Johan Sennero STOCKHOLM, March 3 (Reuters) - Sweden's debt office forecaston Wednesday smaller central government budget deficits thisyear and next as stronger-than-expected economic growth helpedto dampen a rise in unemployment. The Swedish National Debt Office said in a statement it sawa 53 billion Swedish crown ($7.35 billion) deficit this year,compared with a previous forecast, published in October lastyear, for a 64 billion shortfall. "Swedish central government finances will recover somewhatmore quickly as the labour market downturn will be less sharpthan expected," the debt office said, adding it had raised itseconomic growth forecasts somewhat for this year and 2011. "We have therefore reduced our forecast of unemploymentslightly. We still expect an increase in 2010 compared with2009, but next year unemployment will decrease." The Debt Office forecast a deficit of 37 billion crowns in2011, versus the previous outlook for a 40 billion deficit. Thedeficit or surplus determines the government's borrowing need,most of which the debt office covers by issuing bonds. "They're reducing the borrowing requirement a bit more thanwe had expected. But it's not a dramatic change in light of theuncertainty that exists for these figures anyway. But it doesshow that Swedish finances continue to look strong," SEB analystOlle Holmgren said. The debt office said the stable forecasts for the budgetbalance meant it had not needed to make any significant changesto its borrowing plans and that issue volumes of nominalgovernment bonds would remain at 3 billion crowns per auction. "No huge surprise this. It came in pretty unchanged from theprevious forecast without any greater revisions in terms ofissues or anything," Swedbank analyst Knut Hallberg said. "There were some expectations that the borrowing requirementwould be revised down even further, which might have meantscaling back issue volumes from 3 (billion) to 2.5 (billion),but they didn't and yields are up a bit on this." Swedish debt yields rose on the news with the spread betweenthe Swedish and German 10-year benchmark bonds widening byalmost 3 basis points. The debt office said the stock of treasury bills would risein line with its previous forecast while inflation-linkedborrowing fell to 9 billion crowns from 10 billion per year. "Borrowing in foreign currency bonds will be SEK 29 billionin 2010 and SEK 71 billion in 2011," it added.
