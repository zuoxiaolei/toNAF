<raw><![CDATA[ * Greece raises 1.625 bln euros in 6-month T-bills * First borrowing test since May IMF/EU bailout * Yield higher, bid-cover ratio 3.64 versus 7.67 in pvs sale * Greek bank shares up 4.5 percent, add gains after auction * Euro ticks higher vs dollar  (Recasts, adds analyst comment, market reaction) By George Georgiopoulos ATHENS, July 13 (Reuters) - Greece passed its firstborrowing test on Tuesday since a giant EU/IMF funding deal inMay, sending bank stocks and the euro higher after it easilysold 1.625 billion euros ($2.03 billion) of 6-month T-bills. The debt-ridden country managed to get market funding at aslightly cheaper cost than the 5.0 percent it pays to borrowunder the 110 billion euro loan that the European Union andInternational Monetary Fund put in place to calm a crisis thathas shaken the euro zone. But the auction highlighted Greece still had some way to goin convincing investors. The yield was higher than a previoussimilar sale and what other troubled euro zone economies havepaid recently, and demand, while solid, was lower. "We were expecting a good result, and it's good for Greeceand the euro, but (Greece) has a long way to travel, as itseconomic challenges are pretty severe. It's going to take yearsto figure this out, not just one auction," said Paul Robinson, acurrency strategist at Barclays Capital in London. Less oversubscribed than a previous auction in April, thesale produced a yield of 4.65 percent versus 4.55 percent in anApril 13 sale of similar duration paper, the outcome broadly inline with expectations. Tuesday's bid-to-cover ratio was slightly better thanforecast at 3.64 -- though less than half the 7.67 timesoversubscription in the previous April auction. "We are happy with the outcome of the auction," debt agency(PDMA) chief Petros Christodoulou told Reuters. "We werepleasantly surprised with the foreign participation." Markets had expected the issue would be mostly picked up byGreek banks. Christodoulou would not elaborate on how much wastaken up by foreigners.  COSTLY BORROWING Punished for fiscal profligacy, Greece is paying forsix-month paper 8 times what it costs Germany to borrow for oneyear, highlighting the struggle it faces to restore marketconfidence. It is also paying much higher costs than other euro zoneperiphery countries facing fiscal problems although their costshave also been rising. Portugal sold six-month T-bills at 1.947 percent on July 7,while Spain had to pay a yield of 1.577 percent on June 22 forsix-month paper. "It's a marginally positive result. It could have goneworse. On the other hand, Greece is sheltered from any fiscaldefault over at least the next six months, or two years," saidCitigroup economist Giada Gianni. "Since it's a very short-term maturity, it does not reflectmarkets' expectations in terms of Greece's development in thenext years. It's very difficult to say whether it reflectsmarket confidence in Greece," she said. Still, being able to tap markets for six-month funds wasenough to give battered Greek bank shares a boost, driving thesector's index 4.5 percent higher with the euro gaining someground against the dollar. The debt agency accepted an additional 375 million euros innon-competitive bids, bringing total proceeds to 1.625 billioneuros to roll over maturing short-term paper. Settlement date isJuly 16. Another auction of three-month paper will follow next weekto roll over 2.4 billion euros of maturing T-bills.(additional reporting by Renee Maltezou, Harry Papachristouin Athens; Reporting by George Georgiopoulos; Editing by RuthPitchford)             ]]></raw>
