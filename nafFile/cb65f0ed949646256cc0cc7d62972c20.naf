<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro climbs to 14-mth high vs dollar; ECB ahead * Yen hits 11-mth lows vs euro, 6-mth lows vs dollar * Carry trade revival hurts yen, BOJ policy loose (Recasts, updates prices, adds details, adds quote, changesdateline, previous LONDON) NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - The euro rose to its highestin more than a year against the dollar ahead of an expected ECBrate hike, while the yen slid on Wednesday to an 11-month lowagainst the euro and a six-month low against the dollar. More losses were expected for the yen as investors, such asmacro hedge funds, add to bearish bets, with the Bank of Japanlooking set to lag other central banks in tightening policy. In contrast, the European Central Bank is widelyanticipated to raise its benchmark rate by 25 basis points onThursday and follow that with other rate hikes later in theyear. The euro rose as high as $1.4317, according to Reutersdata, its highest since late January 2010, with tradersreporting steady buying by Asian central banks. Large optionbarriers cited at $1.4350 and $1.4400 could cap gains in thenear term, however. It last traded up 0.5 percent at $1.4293. "The euro (move) is all on interest rate expectations,"said John Doyle, strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington."It looks more like a series of interest rate hikes."  The struggling Japanese currency was in danger ofbreaching key long-term support levels against most currencies,having already fallen to a 2-1/2 year low against theAustralian dollar. The yen has slid since the first G7 intervention in adecade last month, stirring talk of a carry trade revival -- astrategy of selling low-yielding currencies to fund investmentin currencies with higher interest rates. "The yen is taking a lead as the global carry trade makes areturn with the Bank of Japan likely to ease policy while theother central banks seek to tighten it," said Lena Komileva,head of G-10 currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. The euro was up 0.9 percent at 121.88 yen, having earliertouching an 11-month peak, with stop-loss buying earlier in thesession adding to its rise. The dollar was up 0.4 percent at 85.20 yen, easing fromhighs on profit taking by Japanese retail investors. It scaled a six-month peak having surged 12 percent fromits post-World War Two record low of 76.25 yen hit in March,days after Japan's northeast was devastated by a massiveearthquake and tsunami. The high-yielding Australian dollar surged to 88.68 yen,its highest since September 2008, with 90 yen seen as the nextpossible target.    The dollar fell 0.8 percent against the Swiss franc to0.9176 francs. An earlier report showed Swiss consumer price inflationrose by more than expected in March. Although Swiss inflationremains low by international standards as the strong franc haslargely shielded the country from rising oil and food prices,the data could raise pressure on the Swiss National Bank totighten rates.
