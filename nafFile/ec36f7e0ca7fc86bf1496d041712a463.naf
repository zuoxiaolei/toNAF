<raw><![CDATA[ * China allows yuan to rise 0.4% to post-devaluation high * Euro rebounds to 4-wk peak, Aussie hits 1-month high * China move seen as helping global economy  By Satomi Noguchi TOKYO, June 21 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar and the eurojumped to their highest levels in about a month against thedollar on Monday after China allowed the yuan to rise to apost-revaluation high, boosting confidence in the global economy. Spot yuan rose to its highest level since its revaluationfive years ago, helping to reinforce market optimism that apledge from China on yuan flexibility would help reduce theglobal imbalance, encouraging sustained global growth andsupporting higher-yielding and riskier assets. "China's commitment to allowing more yuan flexibility isdefinitely an encouraging factor for stability in the market,"said Hideki Amikura, deputy general manager of the forex sectionat Nomura Trust Bank. "It is a sign that China is ready to act responsibly to fixglobal imbalances and avoid potential international conflicts,"he said. The yuan rose as high as about 0.4 percent to 6.8015 perdollar after China broke away from its 23-month-old currency peg. That was enough for the the Aussie and the euro to recoverfrom initial disappointment after China set the yuan's dailymid-point at 6.8275 against the dollar on Monday, unchanged fromlast Friday, the day before Beijing said it would allow the yuanto trade more flexibly. "You can't gauge Beijing's stance on the yuan just fromtoday's mid-point. Obviously we will have to see how much yuanappreciation they allow for the time being," said ShuichiKanehira, head of forex spot trading at Mizuho Corporate Bank. The Aussie gained 1.2 percent to around $0.8824, rising ashigh as $0.8830, a one-month peak. The New Zealand dollar also rose nearly one percent to$0.7121, after having climbed to a five-week high of $0.7140. The euro gained to $1.2457, up 0.6 percent. It earlier markeda four-week high around $1.2490 in early Asian hours. The dollar gained 0.1 percent to 90.77 yen, rebounding higherfrom an earlier three-week low of 90.01 on trading platform EBS. Westpac senior currency strategist Imre Speizer said for avariety of reasons the yuan weekend statement was seen aspositive for commodity currencies such as the Australian and NewZealand dollars, including the prospect of improved exports toChina. "This move may also have been designed to reduce friction atthe G20 meeting involving trade issues," Speizer said. The yuan's value had been seen as a potential point ofconflict at the Group of 20 summit in Toronto on June 26-27, asWashington pressed for moves to a market-based exchange rate,while Beijing had said the currency was its own business andoutsiders should not meddle. Scott Haslem, chief economist at UBS in Sydney saw the dollarreaching 6.55 yuan by year end, with this appreciation of between3 and 4 percent likely achieved in the next few weeks. A more flexible yuan would lessen the threat of a Sino-U.S.trade war, which could have been a danger to global growth, andenable China to buy more commodities, or at least cope betterwith higher commodity prices, a positive for big resourceexporters like Australia and New Zealand. A higher yuan would also help temper inflation in China bypushing down import prices, which in turn could mean Beijingwould have less need to tighten monetary policy aggressively. Markets have been worried China could over-tighten and slowits economy too far. Breaking the peg might mean China needs to buy less U.S.dollars in intervention, which would leave it with fewer dollarsto buy U.S. Treasuries, but also less need to diversify itsholdings into currencies like the euro.
