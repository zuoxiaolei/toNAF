<raw><![CDATA[ * China "approves" $19 bln deal for 200 Boeing aircraft * Honeywell, Caterpillar, Westinghouse Electric get deals * China agrees to open government contracts market more * US says deals will support about 235,000 American jobs (Adds details, quotes) By Caren Bohan and Doug Palmer WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The United States and Chinaon Wednesday agreed on $45 billion in U.S. export deals and togive U.S. companies greater access to China's $88 billion-plusgovernment contracts market at the start of Chinese PresidentHu Jintao's four-day state visit. White House officials said the agreements included China's"final" approval of a $19 billion contract to buy 200 Boeingaircraft for delivery between 2011 and 2013. "From machinery to software, from aviation to agriculture,these deals will support some 235,000 American jobs -- and thatincludes many manufacturing jobs," U.S. President Barack Obamasaid at a joint press conference with Hu. The announcements served to underscore the theme ofeconomic cooperation struck by Hu and Obama. But the size ofthe deals will do little to dent the huge bilateral tradedeficit the United States runs with China, estimated to berunning in 2010 at a record of $275 billion. Many of the orders had been in the works for a while, andshares in the companies affected by the deals weakened onWednesday more steeply than the broader market. Another deal involving GE builds on an existing partnershipwith the Chinese Ministry of Railways to bring Chinesehigh-speed rail technology to the United States, and for GE tomanufacture locomotives for China. The White House also trumpeted deals in various stages ofdevelopment involving Honeywell, Caterpillar, WestinghouseElectric, a unit of Japan's Toshiba Corp, and other companies. While the pacts are significant, Jeremie Waterman, directorfor China at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said they also"highlight how much the Chinese economy is directed by thestate," often to the detriment of U.S. companies. The U.S. Chamber has called forcefully for more opening ofthe Chinese market to U.S. companies. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS Perhaps more encouraging, Waterman said, was progress inopening up the government contract market by addressing"indigenous innovation" policies that U.S. companies say wouldrequire them to transfer technology to the Chinese. China agreed to "delink its innovation policies from itsgovernment procurement preferences," and also repeated apromise not to discriminate against foreign goods or servicesbased on where their intellectual property content is developedor maintained, the White House said in a fact sheet. "That arguably is the most significant commercialcommitment, assuming it is implemented," Waterman said. The Chinese central government buys more than $88 billionannually in goods and services, and provinces andmunicipalities buy even more. U.S. companies such as GE havecomplained of restrictions. "The notion was if we're part of the Chinese economy, weshould be allowed to win," GE's CEO Jeffrey Immelt said in aReuters Insider Television interview after corporate executivesmet with Hu and Obama at the White House. SOFTWARE Hu's visit coincides with rising U.S. criticism that Chinadoes not play by the rules as it amasses economic power anduses a number of policies to maintain a large trade surpluswith the United States. In the meeting with U.S. and Chinese business leaders, Husaid he saw "a promising future" for U.S.-China trade andpledged to maintain a "transparent, just, fair, highlyefficient investment climate" for foreign firms. Although China is one of the fastest-growing export marketsfor the United States, that is overshadowed by imports fromChina that reached an estimated $370 billion in 2010. The two leaders also discussed intellectual property rightsprotection and Obama said China needed to make more progress tostop piracy and counterfeiting of U.S. goods. Microsoft's CEO Steve Balmer, who attended the corporateexecutives meeting, expressed disappointment that no newsoftware sales were announced. U.S. software manufacturers saythey lose billions of dollars in China each year because ofillegal copies. Although Obama touted software exports to China, "we haveseen no evidence of increased sales in recent weeks or months,"said Emery Simon of the Business Software Alliance, whichrepresents Microsoft and other U.S. companies. New software auditing procedures agreed between the twocountries also aren't tough enough to ensure China lives up toits promise to increase use of legal product, Simon said. FAKERY Boeing, while crediting the U.S. government for helping toseal the $19 billion deal, acknowledged the orders had been ontheir books for a while. That prompted some criticism of Obama's announcement. "This kind of fakery is an insult to the American people,and especially to America's legions of unemployed," said AlanTonelson of the U.S. Business and Industry Council. A huge Chinese business delegation has accompanied Hu onhis trip to the United States, and will cap the week in Chicagowhere more deals are expected to be announced. Chinese officials told the Obama administration thatChinese companies had signed 70 contracts worth $25 billion inU.S. exports from 12 states, U.S. officials said. Obama, who hopes to reduce high U.S. unemployment in partby doubling exports in five years, at times acted as U.S.salesman-in-chief during the press conference with Hu. "We want to sell you all kinds of stuff," Obama said. But talks over the past two weeks aimed at reopeningChina's market to U.S. beef showed no success yet. China slapped curbs on U.S. beef in 2003 after the firstcase of mad cow disease was found in the United States, and hasbeen slower than many other countries to reopen its market.
