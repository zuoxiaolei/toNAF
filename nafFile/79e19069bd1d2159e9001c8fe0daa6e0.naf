<raw><![CDATA[ (Refiles to add Shanghai to dateline) By Lucy Hornby and Melanie Lee BEIJING/SHANGHAI, March 9 (Reuters) - The United Stateswould not have any standing to bring a case against ChineseInternet restrictions to the World Trade Organisation, aChinese adviser on WTO strategy said in an opinion piece onTuesday. U.S. trade officials had asked for more information onwhether they could pursue a case at the WTO, after Googlethreatened to shut its China operations following a hackerattack in late 2009. Google said it would work with Chineseauthorities to find a way to offer an unfiltered search enginein China. WTO rules state that countries have the right to censorInternet content, Zheng Zhihai, deputy director and generalsecretary of the China Society of World Trade OrganisationStudies, wrote in a piece published on the China Daily'swebsite on Tuesday. "If someone intends to challenge China's right to governits Internet by resorting to WTO rules, they are apparentlymisguided and bound to fail," wrote Zheng, whose organisationreports to China's Ministry of Commerce. He added that China agreed in its accession to the WTO toprovide national treatment to online information processors anddata search firms if they operated through a joint venture inChina in which they owned no more than 50 percent, somethingGoogle has done. The WTO has been very reluctant to challenge countries'rights to censor content of any type. It ruled last year thatChina's import monopolies on books, films and otherentertainment materials violated market access rules, butupheld its right to censor specific materials. The Bush administration considered, but did not pursue, acase that China's firewall poses a barrier to entry. Before the hacking attack and Google's threat to withdraw,Chinese authorities had appeared to specifically target Googlewith accusations pornography was easily available through itssearch engine, and ordered it to change the way it processedsearch requests. However, Chinese firms, including Google's top rival Baidu,also have to comply with Chinese censorship rules, and often doso preemptively. Chinese officials have been cagey on whether they are intalks with Google. The Minister of Industry and Information Technology, LiYizhong, said on Friday his ministry is talking with Google,but over the weekend his vice minister, Miao Wei, said itwasn't. Google declined to comment on either official's comments. (Editing by Jerry Norton)             ]]></raw>
