<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro down 0.2 percent at $1.4184 * Dollar steadies; more Bernanke testimony * Sterling pares some losses after BoE minutes * Euro zone May industrial orders fall 0.2 percent m/m  (Releads, adds data, quote, updates prices) By Tamawa Desai LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - The euro was pressured againstthe dollar on Wednesday when a recent rally in equity prices ranout of steam, dampening risk-taking sentiment. The dollar held steady, recouping earlier losses as U.S.Treasury yields tumbled after Federal Reserve Chairman BenBernanke said U.S. interest rates would stay low for some time. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down0.5 percent, snapping a seven-day winning run. U.S. stockfutures indexes were also lower, pointing to a weaker open onWall Street. By 0924 GMT, the euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.4184 afterhitting a seven-week high on Tuesday at $1.4278, close to itspeak for the year. Traders reported hefty options activity in euro/dollar at$1.4200, set to expire later in the day. A holder of a digitaloption will get payout if spot is above $1.4200 at expiry, whileother expiries at $1.4200 are thought to total 1 billion euros,market participants say. Data showed euro zone industrial orders data unexpectedlyfell 0.2 percent in May, compared with forecasts for a 1.9percent rise month-on-month, but reaction was limited. "It looks not really consistent with what we had seen forthe euro area," said Juergen Michels, economist at Citigroup, adding he would not be surprised if the figures were substantially revised in due course. Against the yen, the euro fell 0.5 percent from U.S. latetrade on Tuesday to 132.55 yen. The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against sixmajor currencies, was flat at 78.960 after touching 78.591 onTuesday, its lowest since June 3.  STERLING OFF LOWS AFTER BOE MINUTES Sterling pared some losses after minutes from the Bank ofEngland's latest policy meeting showed a unanimous decision tomaintain the bank's 125 billion pound asset-buying total andkeep interest rates at 0.5 percent. The pound was at $1.6371 after falling to around $1.6312,although it was still down 0.4 percent on the day. Higher risk currencies such as the Australian and NewZealand dollars edged down after rising in recent sessions. The Australian dollar fell 0.7 percent to $0.8125 afterhitting a five-week high of $0.8193 on Tuesday. The New Zealanddollar slipped 0.3 percent to $0.6535 after rising to $0.6610 onTuesday. "Levels look quite stretched for these big gainers," saidLee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Meanwhile, traders will keep an eye on the second day ofBernanke's congressional testimony. "Bernanke was trying to improve policy credibility in themarket and anchor inflation expectations," said BTM-UFJ'sHardman. "The dollar has been broadly stable and that is a signthat Bernanke's message has come across well," he said. The dollar eased 0.2 percent to 93.44 yen after sheddingabout 0.5 percent on Tuesday. Bernanke will repeat his testimony before the Senate BankingCommittee at 1400 GMT, and subsequently take questions.
