<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro pressured on concerns about Greek aid * Euro down 0.2 percent at $1.3456 * Yen slips as risk sentiment resumes * Aussie up after upbeat RBA minutes  By Tamawa Desai LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - The yen slipped broadly onTuesday as a sell-off in growth-linked currencies waned and theeuro was pressured on concerns about Greece. The euro fell after European Central Bank Governing Councilmember Axel Weber said Greece may require assistance of up to 80billion euros ($111.8 billion) to avoid default, according to areport in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. That amount would be far larger than the 30 billion euro aidmechanism agreed by euro zone finance ministers earlier thismonth, raising concerns about Greece's ability to tackle itsmassive debt. "No one believe that initial amount would be enough to coverGreece's funding needs," said Lee Hardman, currency economist atBank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.  "The short-term liquidity risk may be reduced, but thatdoesn't resolve the issue of debt sustainability. It's difficultto see a way out for Greece." The market will be closely watching Greece test appetite forits debt later on Tuesday when it comes to the market with a 1.5billion euro sale of 13-week T-bills. By 0839 GMT, the euro was down 0.2 percent on the day at$1.3456. Delays to talks between Greece, European and InternationalMonetary Fund officials over the possible implementation of anaid package for the country weighed on the single currency onMonday.   YEN FALTERS The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's value against abasket of currencies, was flat at 81.03 after pulling back froma high of 81.28. It had gained broadly on Monday after theGoldman news sparked a bout of risk aversion. The dollar recovered after hitting a one-month low againstthe yen on Monday as investor appetite for riskier assets wassupported by some positive U.S. earnings reports, which helpedWall Street shares rise and countered fears about a broaderregulatory impact from the fraud case brought against GoldmanSachs. The dollar rose 0.3 percent from late New York trade to92.64 yen, having hit a low of 91.58 yen on Monday. "Conditions are mainly supportive for risk assets," saidBTM-UFJ's Hardman. The yen remained under pressure on the crosses, particularlyagainst the Australian dollar which gained broadly after minutesof the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) April policy meetingshowed it felt it was not prudent to delay a hike given anexpected boom in the country's terms of trade. The Aussie rose 0.3 percent to $0.9283, testing resistancefrom moving averages on the hourly chart at that level, whilethe kiwi fell 0.5 percent to $0.7102 after the inflation data. Sweden's central bank left interest rates unchanged asexpected, and repeated it would begin tightening policy insummer or early autumn. The Swedish crown initially dippedagainst the euro after the decision. The Bank of Canada is expected to keep rates steady later inthe day, but market participants expect a hawkish tilt to itsassessment given the strength of its economy. "We will be looking for any language shifts in theaccompanying statement that could potentially benefit theCanadian dollar," UBS analysts said in a note.
