<raw><![CDATA[ * Q2 pretax 31 million euros vs f'cast 16.5 million * Sticks to outlook of slight growth in market in 2010 * Market share flat in Q2 * Competition remains tough in sector, eyes on iPhone  (Recasts, adds company, analyst comment) By Simon Johnson and Olof Swahnberg STOCKHOLM, July 16 (Reuters) - Mobile phone maker SonyEricsson pinned its hopes on further growth in the smartphonesegment on Friday as it posted a second consecutive quarterlyprofit, driven by sales of the more expensive gadgets. Sony Ericsson, owned jointly by Ericsson and Sony Corp andwhich is the world's fifth-biggest handset maker, has cut costsand revamped its portfolio with more phones such as the XperiaX10 offering PC-like functions and links to social networkingsites. After a dismal 2009 when consumers cut back on gadgets likenew phones, the outlook for the industry has started to improveand Sony Ericsson returned to profit this year after reportingseven straight quarterly losses. Yet further growth will dependon more success in the smartphone segment. However, competition here -- especially from Apple Inc's iPhone -- is intense. Nokia Oyj, the world's biggest handset maker, issued aprofit warning in June saying its smartphones were strugglingagainst the iPhone, while BlackBerry maker Research in Motion has reported disappointing quarterly shipments. "We believe the challenging market conditions will continuein the second half of the year," company president Bert Nordbergsaid in a conference call. "However, we believe the smartphone sector of the marketwill grow more than 10 percent in volume this year and see good... opportunity for Sony Ericsson to target this area of themarket." Nordberg said Sony Ericsson would broaden its smartphoneportfolio in the second half of the year with cheaper offerings. Greger Johansson, analyst at research firm Redeye, said: "Ithink Sony Ericsson can continue with its positive momentum andraise volumes in the third and fourth quarters. "They have the platform, with strong parents, to recovermarket share, but all their major competitors are focusing onthe smartphone market." TURN-ROUND SITUATION Second-quarter pretax profit rose to 31 million euros ($39.7million) versus a forecast 16.5 million in a Reuters poll. Thecompany lost 283 million euros in the same quarter in 2009. The improvement was partly due to success in newly launchedsmartphones, which pushed up the average selling price (ASP) to160 euros against a forecast of 134 euros. Erik Penser analyst Per Lindtorp said the report was strong."At the same time, Sony Ericsson is in a turn-around situationwhen things can change quickly," he said. Sony Ericsson launched the Xperia X10 and Vivaz smartphonesin the first quarter and the Xperia X10 mini; its Xperia X10mini pro started shipping at the end of the second quarter. Nordberg said new portfolio offerings had been well receivedby operators and the company was in a good position to grow. Despite that, it stuck by a more cautious forecast thananalysts and its competitors. "Sony Ericsson maintains aforecast of slight growth in units in the global handset marketin 2010," it said in a statement. Earlier this month, analysts forecast global handset salesvolume would rise 11.6 percent this year, helped by increasingsmartphone sales. In April, growth was seen at 10.8 percent for2010. Nokia, which reports second-quarter results on July 22,expects industry mobile device volume to be up approximately 10percent in 2010 versus 2009.
