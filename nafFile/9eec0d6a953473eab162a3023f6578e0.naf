<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded higher its major counterparts Thursday, on the release of better than expected U.S. employment data, while concerns over the outlook for the global economy triggered safe haven greenback buying     During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar moved lower against the euro, with EUR/USD losing 0.26% to hit 1.3182.     The Department of Labor reported U.S. jobless claims fell to the lowest level since February 2008 last week, plunging to a seasonally adjusted 348,000, beating expectations for a decline of 3,000 to 350,000.
