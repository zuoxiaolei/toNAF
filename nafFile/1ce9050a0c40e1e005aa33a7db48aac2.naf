<raw><![CDATA[ * Uncertainty on fiscal assistance plan for Greece * Markets unconvinced a bailout would solve Greek problems * Bernanke outlines measures to withdraw stimulus, dlr up (Adds comments, updates prices) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The euro fell against thedollar on Wednesday, weighed down by uncertainty a day before aEuropean Union summit about a possible bailout of debt-strappedGreece. The dollar gained after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman BenBernanke said policy makers may raise the discount rate "beforelong," boosting expectations the U.S. central bank would starttightening monetary policy earlier than its majorcounterparts. "There's a lot of vacillation on the part of policy makers,and there's a lot of uncertainty leading to the Europeanministers' meeting tomorrow about whether Germany would be ableto help Greece or not," said Samarjit Shankar, managingdirector of global FX strategy at BNY Mellon in Boston. "Over the next few weeks, we're looking for the downtrendin the euro to continue," Shankar said. He expects the euro tofall toward $1.35 by the end of the first quarter. Finance ministers of the 16 countries in the euro zone andthe head of the European Central Bank discussed Greece in aconference call on Wednesday, although they made no publiccomments. Euro area finance officials said bilateral aid byindividual European Union members, chiefly Germany and France,or guarantees for Greek debt issues appeared the most likelysolution, but they cautioned that no decision was imminent onthe form of assistance. In late trading, the euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.3728,after hitting a session low of $1.3678, according to Reutersdata. The single currency had climbed a full 1 percent on Tuesdayand pulled further away from an 8-1/2-month trough around$1.3580 hit last week. Some analysts were unconvinced a bailout, if there wereone, would solve all of Greece's problems. Concerns about thefiscal positions of similarly debt-impaired euro zone countriessuch as Portugal and Spain also made investors wary. "I don't think the market is wholeheartedly embracing theidea that with a possible bailout, the worst is behind Greeceor the euro zone," said Vassili Serebriakov, senior currencystrategist at Wells Fargo in New York. "Even if the bailout does come, it's probably a bad signalfor the euro zone in the sense that seemingly bad behavior isbeing encouraged," he added. 'HAWKISH' BERNANKE In his most comprehensive description to date of how theFed aims to withdraw its stimulus, Bernanke said the U.S.central bank could soon raise the discount rate it chargesbanks for emergency loans, but stressed that would not be akinto a tightening in monetary policy. "At the margin, the market is taking him as being slightlymore hawkish," said Jacob Oubina, senior currency strategist atForex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. "He said that the Fed may opt to raise the discount rate'before long.' That's being construed as dollar-positivebecause it suggests the Fed will be more aggressive than, say,the ECB, or the Bank of England ... in terms of tighteningpolicy." The dollar reversed losses against the yen and last tradedat 89.96 yen, up 0.4 percent. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index rose 0.3percent to 80.080. Sterling fell broadly after the Bank of England releaseddovish inflation forecasts and left open the door to extendingquantitative easing. The pound last traded down 0.8 percent at $1.5579, whilethe euro rose 0.4 percent to 88.10 pencec. (Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing byLeslie Adler)             ]]></raw>
