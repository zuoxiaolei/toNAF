<raw><![CDATA[ By Natalya Zinets KIEV, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Ukraine's economy will return togrowth in the first half of next year after the deepestcontraction of the past 15 years in 2009, Economy MinisterBohdan Danylyshyn told Reuters in an interview on Friday. The ex-Soviet state agreed a $16.4 billion bailout programmewith the International Monetary Fund last year when the globalcrisis slashed demand for exports, driving down the hryvniacurrency and battering the banking system. Danylyshyn said he expected gross domestic product (GDP) tofall 10-12 percent this year after growth of 2.1 percent lastyear. The country's economy had been growing at an average rateof 7 percent since 2000 before the crisis hit home. "Positive trends in the economy have already begun and bythe end the year they will strengthen," Danylyshyn said.  "In 2010 we will step by step move forward with developingour economy. We expect that we will have a positive resultalready in the first half of next year. "Due to the low base effect, it is possible for GDP to grow3.7 percent next year. And in 2012 we will return to pre-crisislevels of GDP," he said. The government has forecast economic growth for the fullyear next year at 3.7 percent. The World Bank thinks growth willbe lower -- at 1.5 percent, while the International MonetaryFund (IMF) predicts 3 percent. The IMF has disbursed over $10 billion of its rescue fundsto Ukraine, whose economy is still industry driven and easilyaffected by foreign demand and price swings for its steel andchemicals. The steel industry comprises 40 percent of all thatUkraine exports, and exports themselves traditionally make upalmost half of GDP. Danylyshyn forecast industrial output would grow 2.9 percentin 2010 after an expected 17 percent fall this year. It grew 3.1percent last year but fell 30 percent in the first quarter ofthis year. Danylyshyn said he expected food production to grow 3percent, metal production also by 3 percent and machine buildingby 5 percent next year. All three sectors have shrunk this year.He saw inflation this year at 12-13 percent and below 10percent next year. Inflation had been a huge problem in Ukraine-- last year prices rose 22.3 percent after 16.6 percent growthin 2007. "In previous years, the main reason for inflation was pricerises for various food products, which form a large part of theconsumer price index basket," Danylyshyn said. "For 2010, we do not have such expectations -- the projectedharvest and availability of those food products ... allows us tosay that there will not be a price spike," he said.
