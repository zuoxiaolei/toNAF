<raw><![CDATA[ * NZ current account deficit 2.3 percent of GDP * Improvement likely but temporary * Deficit helped by insurance payments, exports (Adds details, graphic link, comment)	 By Mantik Kusjanto	 WELLINGTON, March 23 (Reuters) - New Zealand's annualcurrent account deficit widened in the fourth quarter, but isexpected to show a sharp improvement in the near term asinsurance payments flow into the country to pay for rebuildingafter last month's earthquake.	 The deficit for the year to Dec. 31 increased to NZ$4.38billion ($3.2 billion) from a revised deficit of NZ$4.19 billionfor the year to Sept 30, equating to 2.3 percent of grossdomestic product (GDP) compared with the forecast of 2.4 percentin a Reuters poll. 	 The current account deficit is expected to narrow and thebalance may move to surplus in the short term as insurancepayouts start flowing to cover the estimated NZ$10 billion ($7.4 billion) cost of the Feb 22 which devastated Christchurch,the country's second-largest city, and killed at least 166people.	 But the improvement is expected to be temporary as a pick-upin growth on the back of reconstruction bolsters imports.	 "Looking at 2012, reconstructing Christchurch is going torequire a lot of imports and you've got to expect the currentaccount deficit will be out to 5 percent of GDP by the end ofnext year," said Deutsche Bank chief economist Darren Gibbs.	 The New Zealand dollar fell to $0.7391/99 from about$0.7404/13 before the data, before steadying around $0.7394,while bank bills <0#NBB> were little changed.	 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   For a table on current account details      	 To read Instant Views                        	 For Reuters poll                                  	 For a graphic on NZ current account     	 http://link.reuters.com/gyq68r	   The Reserve Bank of New Zealand slashed interest rates by 50basis points to 2.5 percent this month to restore confidence andcushion the economy after the Christchurch earthquake.	 The economy stalled in the second half of 2010, contracting0.2 percent in the third quarter from the previous quarter. Dataon Thursday is expected to show scant growth of 0.1 percent inthe fourth quarter, according to a Reuters poll, though someanalysts believe the country slipped back into recession.	  DEFICITS	 New Zealand's chronic current account deficit has been along standing concern for ratings agencies, more so recentlybecause of the higher global sensitivity to debt.	 The current account deficit in the December quarter widenedto NZ$3.52 billion from a sharply revised NZ$29 million deficitin the September quarter.	 Statistics NZ revised the third quarter number from NZ$1.77billion deficit after raising its insurance payment estimatefrom offshore to NZ$3.6 billion from NZ$1.7 billion. 	 The annual balance showed an improving trade surplus, withstrong commodity exports and weak imports. Export volumesrebounded from the third quarter, when drought hit agriculturalexports.	 However, the investment deficit -- the gap between earningsfor foreign investors in New Zealand and the country's foreigninvestments -- remained large at NZ$10.7 billion from NZ$10.8 billion in the third quarter. 	 The services deficit more than doubled for the year astourism receipts fell.	 The central bank has forecast the annual current accountwill post a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP by March 2011, asinsurance payments for earthquake damage swell .   	 But the gap is seen rising to 5.1 percent of GDP by March2014 as the economy returns to normal growth, increasing importsand investment earnings for foreigners.  	 "We continue to expect ratings pressure," said RBCstrategist Michael Turner.	 Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings have both cut theiroutlook for New Zealand's foreign-currency credit ratings tonegative from stable because of concerns about the country'sforeign debt mountain.	 New Zealand relies heavily on foreign borrowing to fund its  deficits because of perennially low levels of household saving. 	The government has said it wants to increase national savings.	 The IMF said this week raising national saving throughfiscal consolidation is key to containing the rising currentaccount deficit.	 New Zealand's net foreign liabilities fell to 81.7 percentof GDP from 83.8 percent in the previous quarter as householddeposits increased and lending was subdued. By comparisonAustralia's level is around 60 percent.	 ($1=NZ$1.35)  		 (Editing by Kim Coghill)	              ]]></raw>
