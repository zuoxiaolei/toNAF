<raw><![CDATA[ (Recasts with economists' comments) By Jan Strupczewski BRUSSELS, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentimenteased marginally in February against January, defying marketexpectations of a small rise and adding to concerns about thesustainability of a recovery in the economy. Sentiment in the 16 countries using the euro eased to 95.9points from 96.0 in January against market expectations of arise to 96.2, the European Commission said as pessimism amonghouseholds and retailers offset gains in industry and services. "The relapse ... in overall euro zone economic sentiment inFebruary adds to the current heightened concerns over thestrength and sustainability of the euro zone's recovery fromrecession," said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. Sentiment in industry improved to -13 from -14 points and inthe services sector to +1 from -1. But the mood deteriorated to -17 from -16 among householdsand to -9 from -5 in the retail sector. "The combination is consistent with underlying weakness inconsumer demand, one of the main factors underlying ourscepticism on a strong and sustainable recovery," said LuigiSperanza, economist at BNP Paribas. "Note, however, that unusually cold weather may have playeda part, exacerbating the underlying trend," he said.  MOMENTUM LOST The Commission said that after 10 months of uninterruptedimprovement in sentiment, the rebound appeared to have lostmomentum but the indicator was not far off its long-termaverage, especially for the 27-country European Union. The indicator of consumer inflation expectations, which theEuropean Central Bank monitors for its policy decisions, rose to0 from -2 in January, suggesting households no longer expectedprices to fall but did not see them rising either. In industry, selling-price expectations increased to -4 from-6, but they deteriorated to -9 from -6 in the retail sector. The Commission's business climate indicator, which points tothe phase of the business cycle, rose to -0.98 in February from-1.13 in January. "Firms' selling-price expectations rose in February, butthey were still extremely low by historical standards. Consumerprice expectations 12 months ahead, albeit increasing, were alsovery low," said Clemente de Lucia, economist at BNP Paribas. "With low inflationary pressures and a still fragilerecovery, the ECB is likely to leave the refi rate unchangeduntil 2011," de Lucia said. (Editing by Dale Hudson)              ]]></raw>
