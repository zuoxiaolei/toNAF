<raw><![CDATA[   * C$ ends at 98.18 U.S. cents * Charge toward U.S. dollar parity stalls * Investors await Canada, U.S. jobs data * Bond prices mixed (Updates with closing figures, adds quotes) By Jennifer Kwan TORONTO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar retreatedfrom its recent charge toward parity with the U.S. dollar onThursday as the greenback rebounded, while commodity and stockprices weakened ahead of key employment data due on Friday. The U.S. dollar regained some footing after slipping to a15-year low versus the yen. And, as traders bet momentum hadswung too far, too fast, commodity prices pulled away fromgains that had pushed gold to record highs. [MKTS/GLOB] The U.S dollar had been battered in recent sessions ongrowing prospects the the Federal Reserve will expand itspurchases of bonds in an effort to keep interest rates low andstimulate a struggling U.S. economy. The Canadian dollar hit a five-month high against thegreenback on Wednesday. "The story today isn't necessarily about Canadian dollarweakness, it's more just U.S. dollar strength," said DavidTulk, senior macro strategist at TD Securities. "I think we saw a pretty sizable run forward in theCanadian dollar the last couple of days so it just seems somefatigue has set in and investors are re-evaluating theirpositions ahead of tomorrow's payrolls report and Canada's jobsnumbers." U.S. nonfarm payrolls for September are expected to belittle changed [ID:nN05187700], while Canada is seen adding10,000 jobs. [ID:nN01221816] "Many people have expected that the labor market is thiskey indicator for the Fed to consider quantitative easing,"said Tulk, referring to the U.S. jobs report. "In terms of the market's reaction, they will hop all overthe prospect of a weak data point to suggest that quantitativeeasing is imminent. You would see a rally in Treasuries andprobably a rally in equities." The Canadian dollar  finished at C$1.0185 to theU.S. dollar, or 98.18 U.S. cents, down from Wednesday's finishof C$1.0107 to the U.S. dollar, or 98.94 U.S. cents. Oil, a key Canadian export, fell below $82 a barrel andgold sank from a record high above $1,364 an ounce. [O/R][GOL/] On Wednesday, the Canadian dollar rose as high as C$1.0063to the U.S. dollar, or 99.37 U.S. cents, its highest levelsince April 30. Given the power of the recent U.S. dollar selloff, it isreasonable to expect a pause, said David Watt, senior currencystrategist at RBC Capital Markets. He added that investors mayalso be cautious ahead of the imminent start of earningsseason, and ahead of the employment reports. BONDS MIXED Canadian bond prices were in line with U.S. Treasuries,where the short end gained on anxiety about the upcoming jobsdata and on expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve willtake steps to make credit easier. [US/] "I think it's a quiet day in bond land. There's a certainamount of positioning ahead of tomorrow's numbers. The biggerstory is what will happen tomorrow," said TD's Tulk. The two-year bond  rose 4 Canadian cents to yield1.333 percent, while the 10-year bond  edged 2Canadian cents lower to yield 2.753 percent.
