<raw><![CDATA[ * Meeting to "take stock" of situation * No fresh moves likely on Greek aid mechanism * Apart from Greece, will not discuss individual countries * Presentation on euro zone reform to be brief  By Jan Strupczewski BRUSSELS, April 14 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministerslook unlikely to break new ground on the Greek crisis orlong-term reform of the zone at talks in Madrid this week. Finance ministers from the 16 countries using the euro willmeet on Friday and Saturday in Madrid, joined for part of thetime by finance ministers and central bank governors from therest of the European Union. After last Sunday's announcement by euro zone governments ofa 30 billion euro financial safety net for Greece, the Madridmeeting will largely "take stock" of the situation rather thanseek fresh solutions, said one source close to preparations forthe meeting. "Given what we discussed last Sunday, the degree of urgencyon Greece has diminished. It will be more stock-taking ratherthan having to decide anything new or substantive. It should bequieter than previous discussions on Greece," the source said. After an initial, positive reaction to the announcement ofthe safety net, markets have begun to worry about legal issuessurrounding it and ambiguity over the precise way the mechanismwould be activated, if Greece asks for aid. Greek bond yields rose back on Wednesday after a newspaperreported that an economist in Germany, where public opinion isstrongly against helping Greece, would file a suit against theaid scheme in Germany's Constitutional Court. [ID:nLDE63D0QX] However, EU sources suggested such issues were unlikely tobe discussed in Madrid.  UPDATE ON GREECE Greece may give the ministers an update on its situationafter it successfully tapped markets at a Treasury bill autionon Tuesday, a second source with insight into the preparationssaid. Asked what additional conditions Greece would have to meetto receive emergency aid if it made such a request, the sourcesaid any requirements might be for more structural oradministrative reforms, and reforms to its methods of gatheringstatistics or providing information. "But definitely nobody will ask Greece to do more than the 4percent of GDP correction of their deficit this year. You cansafely exclude that," the source said. Greece has promised to cut its government budget deficit to8.7 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 from an estimated12.7 percent in 2009. The ministers will also discuss long-term budget deficit-cutting programmes in other euro zone countries that havealready been assessed by the European Commission. "There are no major points of disagreement; the discussionwill be more horizontal -- what needs to be done now in terms ofbudget consolidation, a few more general messages," the sourcesaid. "We will not discuss individual countries."  LONG-TERM REFORM Financial markets are also eager for signs of how the eurozone may strengthen coordination of economic policies amongcountries, and reduce wide divergencies in the performance ofeconomies that contributed to the Greek crisis. European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner OlliRehn will present to the ministers in Madrid his initial ideason how to overhaul the EU's economic governance. However, the discussion will be very preliminary because theEuropean Commission only intends to present its reform proposalson May 12, sources said. Rehn presented some of his ideas at a news conference onWednesday, including having the commission place more emphasison reducing debt in euro zone countries, and possibly suspendingthe flow of EU aid in the form of structural funds to countriswhich break fiscal rules. [ID:nLDE63D2AA] Rehn said the Commission would be issuing more earlywarnings to countries with budget policies that were heading inthe wrong direction -- an option used very rarely until now. "It will not go further than a short presentation and anexchange of views," the first source said of Rehn's presentationin Madrid. "There is general backing for it, the timing is right. Ifnot now, then when?" (Editing by Andrew Torchia)             ]]></raw>
