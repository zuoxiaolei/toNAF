<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro was broadly lower against its global counterparts on Monday, as ongoing concerns over the economic and financial outlook for Spain weighed, while uncertainty ahead of weekend elections in Spain and Greece also soured sentiment.During European late morning trade, the euro was lower against the U.S. dollar, with EUR/USD shedding 0.28% to hit 1.3215.Concerns over the economic outlook for Spain re-remerged after official data confirmed that the country’s economy entered a recession in the first quarter, with gross domestic product contracting by 0.3% in the three months to March and 0.4% year-on-year.Market reaction remained muted as the figures were slightly better than estimates released by the Bank of Spain last week for a 0.4% contraction in the first quarter and a 0.5% contraction on the year.The data came after a government report on Friday showed that the country’s unemployment rate climbed to a record 24.4% in the first quarter.In addition, ratings agency Standard & Poor’s announced widespread credit ratings downgrades on Spain’s troubled banking sector, following a two notch downgrade of the country’s sovereign credit rating last week.Elsewhere, official data showed that consumer price inflation in the euro zone remained unchanged at 2.6% in April, but was higher than forecasts for a reading of 2.5%, dampening expectations for a rate cut by the European Central Bank.Sentiment on the greenback remained weak after Friday’s disappointing data on first quarter U.S. growth fuelled speculation that the Federal Reserve may implement a fresh round of monetary stimulus measures.The single currency was hovering close to a 22-month low against the broadly stronger pound, with EUR/GBP losing 0.22% to hit 0.8130.The pound remained supported, despite data last week showing that the U.K. economy entered a recession in the first quarter, as investor’s favored the currency as an alternative to the euro and the U.S. dollar.The euro was weaker against the yen, but remained little changed against the Swiss franc, with EUR/JPY down 0.38% to hit 105.96 and EUR/CHF inching up 0.02% to hit 1.2016.The shared currency was mixed against the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars, with EUR/CAD losing 0.10% to hit 1.2981, EUR/AUD rising 0.18% to hit 1.2680 and EUR/NZD inching up 0.02% to hit 1.6125.In New Zealand, government data showed that the trade surplus narrowed unexpectedly in March, falling to NZD134 million from a surplus of NZD161 million the previous month.A separate report showed that building consents in New Zealand jumped 19.8% in March, after a 6.7% fall the previous month.Later in the day, the U.S. was to publish official data on core personal consumption expenditures price inflation and personal spending, as well as a report on business activity in Chicago.              ]]></raw>
