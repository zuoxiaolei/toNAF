<raw><![CDATA[ * EU needs permanent crisis mechanism; markets expect it * U.S. bond buying, deficit spending "clueless"  * EU, G20, G11 must coordinate economic policy By Brian Rohan and Annika Breidthardt BERLIN, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Europe needs to strengtheneconomic governance and agree on a permanent crisis resolutionmechanism, all the more so given current U.S. economic weakness,German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Friday. Speaking at a conference in Berlin, Schaeuble took issuewith the European Central Bank's reluctance to support both apermanent structure to prevent future economic crises andstrengthen the European Union's budget rules. "I am of the opinion, and I know (ECB President Jean-Claude)Trichet doesn't agree with me, we in Europe cannot do without acrisis management mechanism on top of a strengthened stabilityand growth pact," Schaeuble said. Replacement of the current mechanism, set up in the wake ofthe Greek debt crisis to prevent it from spreading and to helpstabilise the euro currency, was on track and would likely notdisturb financial markets, he argued. "I believe we are on track to developing a reasonablemechanism in the EU ... Market participants have longanticipated and are expecting it, Schaeuble said. Germany has pushed for a replacement of the programme, whichexpires in 2013, and increased economic coordination in the EU-- a goal advanced last month when plans it put forward withFrance to make limited changes to the bloc's treaty and tightenbudgetary rules gained approval. France and Germany should maintain their leadership role inEurope, Schaeuble said, especially in order to harmonise itseconomic policy and bolster stability given current economicuncertainties. These are being worsened by reckless policy in part from thethe United States, Schaeuble said, sharpening his criticism ofthe Federal Reserve's programme to buy an additional $600billion worth of U.S. government bonds. Pumping more money into the economy will not solve thecountry's problems, he said, adding that the world needed U.S.leadership that was currently lacking.  "With all due respect, U.S. policy is clueless," Schaeublesaid. "(The problem) is not a shortage of liquidity. It's notthat the Americans haven't pumped enough liquidity into themarket." Late on Thursday, Schaeuble said Germany would take up thispoint critically with the United States both bilaterally and atnext week's G20 summit of industrialised and emerging nations.[ID:nLDE6A32NJ] Aside from the G20, international economic coordinationcould prove nimbler in a smaller framework, Schaeuble said. "The G11, a combination of the G7 (industrialised) and BRICcountries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) could become aninstrument with which we gain capability to act."
