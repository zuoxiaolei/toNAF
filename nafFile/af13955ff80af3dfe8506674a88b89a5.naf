<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded mixed against its rivals Wednesday, as market sentiment remained supported by expectations for central bank action to manage the euro zone debt crisis,  while the pound held gains following comments by Bank of England Governor Mervyn King. During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.34% to 1.2357. Market sentiment waned after weaker-than-expected German economic data indicated that the effects of the long running debt crisis are continuing to take a toll on the region’s largest economy.   German industrial production fell 0.9% in June, more than forecasts for a 0.8% decline, following an upwardly revised 1.7% gain in May. The euro’s losses were limited amid expectations that the European Central Bank will soon take steps to help lower Spanish and Italian borrowing costs after the bank indicated last week that it may restart its bond buying program. The greenback was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD advancing 0.30% to 1.5667. The pound strengthened against the greenback after BoE Governor Mervyn King said that cutting interest rates could be more counterproductive than beneficial. Speaking following the release of the BoE’s quarterly inflation report, Governor King stopped short of ruling out a rate cut in the coming months, but indicated that such a move was unlikely, saying it would damage some financial institutions. But the outlook for sterling remained grim after the BoE cut its forecasts for economic growth, saying the rate of growth in two years time was likely to be around 2% per year, significantly lower than its May forecast for growth of around 2.67%. The central bank said inflation would be just below 1.7% in two years, with broadly balanced risks of it being above or below 2%. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen, with USD/JPY retreating 0.32% to 78.35, but pushed higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF rising 0.29% to 0.9715. In Switzerland, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs said Wednesday that the consumer confidence index dropped to minus 17 for the April to July period, down from a reading of minus 8 points in the three months to April, amid growing pessimism over the economic outlook and unemployment. Analysts had expected the index to improve to a reading of minus 4. The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD down 0.25% to 0.9944, AUD/USDclimbing 0.16% to 1.0570 and NZD/USD dipping 0.07% to 0.8155. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.13% to 82.41.              ]]></raw>
