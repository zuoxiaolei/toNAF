<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro zone ministers delay 12 bln euro loan to Greece * Investors grapple with how much risk Greece crisis poses * U.S. stocks rise but European shares down on unease (Adds fresh market prices) By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters) - Oil slid and the euro wavered on Monday as risk aversion rose after European financeministers postponed doling out emergency loans to Greece untilthe debt-strapped country approves new austerity measures. Euro zone ministers meeting in Luxembourg gave Greece twoweeks to approve stricter austerity measures in return foranother 12 billion euros ($17 billion) in aid, piling pressureon Athens to get its ragged finances in order. For more, see:[ID:nLDE75I0FM] Many asset classes hovered near break-even as investorsgrappled with whether Greece's fiscal crisis posed systemicrisks, as well as the outlook for a flagging U.S economy. The euro slid against the Swiss franc but recouped lossesagainst the U.S. dollar and yen, while the dollar rose slightlyagainst a basket of major currencies. The U.S. Dollar Index was up 0.04 percent and the euro  was down 0.03percent. Wall Street moved higher, pulling global stock indexes upto break-even levels, and bond prices fell, erasing early gainsas fears over contagion from Greece's debt crisis waned. "Even though the EU is talking tough it looks like thingsare going to come through in terms of providing additionalfunding, at least through the end of this year, and probablysomething will come together on the broader package as well,"said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer of OakBrookInvestments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes  fell 3/32in price to yield 2.95 percent. Yields earlier hit 2.89percent. "Treasury bulls may in fact have gotten a bit over excitedin the early trade," said Gennadiy Goldberg, fixed incomeanalyst at 4Cast Ltd. in New York. The 10-year note has strong technical resistance at 2.88percent, the lowest yield since the beginning of December and alevel tested last week. A further drop in U.S. bond yields may depend on whetherinvestors fear a higher risk of contagion from the troubledeuro zone, or see much weaker economic data. "The market is having difficulty rallying without bad newsfrom Europe or bad news on the side of the U.S. economy," saidCharles Comiskey, head of Treasury trading at Bank of NovaScotia in New York. U.S. stocks also came close to a key technical level as theStandard & Poor's 500 index dipped toward 1,259, its 200-daymoving average, which encouraged buyers. The index last fellbelow that level in September 2010. "From a technical point of view, the 200-day moving averageis where the market gains support," said Jason Ware, seniorequity analyst at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City. The Dow Jones industrial average  was up 59.26points, or 0.49 percent, at 12,063.62. The Standard & Poor's500 Index  was up 5.49 points, or 0.43 percent, at1,276.99. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 13.09points, or 0.50 percent, at 2,629.56. European shares fell on growing unease about the euro zonedebt crisis and a possible downgrade of Italy's credit rating.[ID:nLDE75J1P7] The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  index of topshares closed 0.5 percent lower at 1,081.19 points, its lowestclosing level in three months. "There seems to be a standoff between euro zone financeministers and Greece and that is causing uncertainty about thenext tranche of funds and encouraging risk aversion," saidJoshua Raymond, market strategist at City Index. Banks were under pressure, with the STOXX Europe 600banking index  down 0.9 percent. World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index straddled break-even, down 0.04 percent. Oil prices in London fell while U.S crude prices rose,reflecting swelling inventories. Brent crude  fell $1.32 to $111.89 a barrel. U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose 31 cents to $93.32 abarrel. Commodity markets remained fixed on the European debtcrisis, led by whether Greece will win more aid. "An expected short-term agreement will likely enablemarkets to breathe a little easier and allow commoditycomplexes to stage a respectable bounce on account of astronger euro," MF Global analysts said in a note. "However, any 'solution' for Greece will be a temporary fixat best, as this issue is far too difficult to be wrapped up ina few weeks." Spot gold prices  rose $1.24 to $1,540.20 an ounce.
