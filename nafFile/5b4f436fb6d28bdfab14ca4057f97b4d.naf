<raw><![CDATA[ * G20 currency promise buys time for diplomatic efforts * Currency legislation to be left to next U.S. Congress By Donna Smith WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate is unlikelyto take up pending China currency legislation following aweekend promise by the Group of 20 economic powers to shuncurrency devaluations for trade advantage, analysts said onSunday. Finance ministers from G20 leading and emerging economiesagreed at a weekend meeting in South Korea to "refrain fromcompetitive devaluations" of their currencies and to pursue afull range of policies to reduce excessive externalimbalances. Congressional elections will be held in the United Stateson Nov. 2, and only a few weeks are planned for a post-electionsession in which the U.S. Congress has to tackle major spendingand income tax issues. There was little chance even before the G20 meeting thatthe Senate was going to act on legislation passed by the Houseof Representatives aimed at pressuring China to raise the valueof its currency. But pressure to act has been mounting from some lawmakersand U.S. manufacturers hurt by China's trade advantages and ithas been an issue in some election campaigns in industrialstates like Pennsylvania. The G20 agreement buys U.S. TreasurySecretary Timothy Geithner some time to pursue a diplomaticapproach with Beijing over the value of the yuan. "I think he bought some time with the Congress," saidDonald Straszheim, senior managing director for China researchat ISI Group in Los Angeles. "The Senate isn't going to takethis up in a lame duck session. There is just too muchpotentially to lose and not enough to gain. They'll leave thisuntil the next Congress." The Nov. 2 elections will determine which party controlsthe next Congress, which will be seated in January. Republicansare poised to make big gains and possibly take control of theHouse. Democrats are likely to retain slim control of theSenate with Republicans expected to pick up a number of seats. "I don't think they (the Senate) are ever going to take it(the China currency legislation) up," said Paul J. Markowski ofGlobal Strategies-Analysis Group/MES Advisers, a New Yorkconsulting group. ACTION WILL TAKE TIME Geithner, who met briefly on Sunday with Vice Premier WangQishan in eastern China, may have secured some promises fromthe Chinese to take action on its currency but it will taketime, Markowski said. The main aim of the two days of finance minister talks,which precede a G20 summit in Seoul on Nov. 11-12, was to easethe currency strains that some economists feared could escalateinto trade wars. U.S. officials said they were pleased with the main pointsof the G20 agreement -- although it stopped short of settingany targets to reduce trade imbalances. There was little reaction on Sunday from lawmakers whoclaim China's yuan is misaligned in value, distorting trade andstealing U.S. jobs. But a spokesman for Senator Debbie Stabenow said theMichigan Democrat would push to pass the currency legislation. "We must hold China accountable and stop currencymanipulation which hurts Michigan businesses and workers,"spokesman Matt Williams said. The House-passed legislation would threaten China withtariffs on some of its goods unless there was significantupward movement in the value of the yuan. A number of international analysts have said threateningChina would be counterproductive and Geithner has pursued amore diplomatic approach, trying to convince Beijing it wouldbe in its own best interest to adopt a market-based currencyregime.
