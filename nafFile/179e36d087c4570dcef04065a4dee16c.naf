<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The yen extended gains against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, breaking below the 93 mark following a New York Times report that China is near to announcing a "small but immediate" revaluation of the yuan.USD/JPY hit 92.83 during European morning trade, its lowest since March 31; the pair subsequently consolidated around 92.9, shedding 0.48%. USD/JPY was likely to find support at 89.63, the low of March 9, and short-term resistance at 94.69, Friday's high.In the report, the Times quoted people with knowledge of the consensus emerging in Beijing as saying that while a last-minute glitch that could delay the announcement, China’s central bank appears to have prevailed with its arguments within the Chinese leadership for a stronger but more flexible currency.Any yuan appreciation is likely to strengthen the yen, since traders use the Japanese currency, Asia's most liquid and flexible, as a proxy for other less flexible currencies in the region.Earlier Thursday, a government report showed that Japanese machinery orders unexpectedly fell in February for the second consecutive month. Later in the day, the U.S. Labor Department was scheduled to release a key report on initial jobless claims, an important indicator of overall economic health.             ]]></raw>
