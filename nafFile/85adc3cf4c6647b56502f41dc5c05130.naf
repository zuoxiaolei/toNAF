<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen briefly hits 10-month low vs euro; Aussie at 20-yrpeak * Dollar hesitates before March 11 high of 83.30 yen * Euro gains limited before Irish stress test By Natsuko Waki	 TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - The yen hit a fresh 10-month lowversus the euro on Thursday and touched a three-week troughagainst the dollar as expectations mounted that Japan would lagthe euro zone and U.S. central banks in raising interest rates.	 The dollar's advance slowed into the Asian afternoon withthe March 11 high of 83.30 yen proving tough resistance, whileselling by Japanese banks and foreign players along with somefiscal year-end yen demand from Japanese exporters pushing thepair close to the 100-day moving average around 82.60.	 The yen was unable to recover strongly, however, as hawkishcomments by euro zone and U.S. central bank officials reinforcedthe view that the global economic recovery is on track,bolstering risk-friendly sentiment at the end of a volatilequarter.	 Anticipation that Japan would buck the global tighteningcycle and leave interest rates low to support its quake-hiteconomy is encouraging players to sell the yen to fundhigher-yielding investments, in a revival of the carry tradethat flourished before the credit crisis began in 2007.	 "Interest rate differentials are the strongest driver of themarket. The Fed is starting to communicate to the market thatQE2 is ending in June. The focus is now moving to the exit fromthe strategy," said Teppei Ino, analyst at Bank of TokyoMitsubishi UFJ.	 "The dollar is catching up with the euro in terms ofinterest rate expectations, as euro rate hike expectations havebeen largely priced in."	 The dollar rose to 83.21 yen before stepping back to82.71. At Thursday's high, the dollar was up 9 percent from itsrecord low of 76.25 yen set on March 17 before G7 central banksintervened in a rare coordinated move to stem the yen's rise. 	 However, dollar buying fizzled in the face of key resistanceat 83.30 and offers from Japanese exporters at 83.50. A break ofthe 100-day moving average around 82.60 may trigger moreselling.	 The euro rose as high as 117.54 yen , its highestsince May 2010, bringing its gains this year to 8 percent. 	 Jefferies analyst Naomi Fink said the start of the newfiscal year could bring more yen selling although it wasunlikely to fall in a straight line.	 "I see a trend of greater tolerance. Households andcompanies have a lot of cash and they will need to invest inoverseas ventures. Overseas investments in the new financialyear should weaken the yen a bit more," she said.	 The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.4156 , facingresistance at $1.4220 and $1.4248. BNP Paribas is recommendingbuying euros from $1.4120 to target $1.45 with a stop at$1.4020.	 The Australian dollar was the main beneficiary of flows intohigher-yielders, hitting a fresh 29-year high of $1.0348 after favourable retail sales and credit growth data. 	 The dollar index fell a quarter percent to 75.903 .	  EURO'S CHALLENGES	 Wednesday's comments from top Federal Reserve officialsadded to expectations that the central bank is nearing the endof its current round of stimulus. [ID:nN30180403]	 Still, the European Central Bank is set to be the frontrunner in the tightening cycle, which is helping the euro acrossthe board.	 ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said onThursday the central bank's policy is to gradually raiseinterest rates, while another board member, Juergen Stark, saidrates are exceptionally low, cementing expectations for an Aprilinterest rate hike. 	 "The barrage of ECB commentary shows a central bank wantingto keep liquidity operations separate from rate policy; theagenda has already moved on to how hawkish Mr. (ECB PresidentJean-Claude) Trichet will sound at the April 7 pressconference," BNP Paribas said in a note to clients.	 Credit Agricole said the euro may struggle to advancefurther against the dollar, however, given that the euro zonerate outlook is largely priced in.	 The bank said the correlation between euro/dollar and thethree-month eurozone-U.S. interest rate spread stands at 0.95,showing an extremely close relationship.	 Investors are also nervous about the risk that the euro zonedebt crisis may spread to other peripheral countries. 	 Ireland will announce the results of stress tests later onThursday that are expected to signal the effectivenationalisation of the entire financial system.
