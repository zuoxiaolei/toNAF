<raw><![CDATA[ GYEONGJU, South Korea, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Statement by U.S.Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner following the end onSaturday of a two-day meeting of group of 20 finance ministersand central bank chiefs in South Korea. "We met here against the backdrop of a world economy that isgradually healing from the damage caused by the financial crisis. The world is growing, and overall we believe the recoverywill gradually strengthen in the coming months. We still face very substantial economic challenges across theadvanced and developing economies. We need stronger growth in themajor economies. Emerging economies are facing the very different challenge ofmanaging the pressures associated with very strong growth. We spent the last few weeks exploring ways to strengthen ourcooperation on exchange rate and other economic policies. The most important thing we achieved is agreement on aframework for curbing excess trade imbalances in the future.  Whythis focus on balance, and why is this important? "The world economy is going through a necessary, butcomplicated process of adjustment. The major economies are all in varying stages of workingthrough the large financial imbalances - excess borrowingrelative to income, overinvestment in real estate, unsustainableleverage in the financial sector -- all of which contributed tothe crisis and will slow the pace of recovery. Emerging market economies are expanding at a rapid pace, andare attracting substantial flows of capital. If the world is going to be able to grow at a strong,sustainable pace  in the future, if we are going to be successfulin building a more stable global financial system, and if we aregoing to be able continue to expand opportunities for trade andpreserve an open trading system, then we need to work to achievemore balance in the pattern of global growth as we recover fromthe crisis. This requires a shift in growth strategies by countries thathave traditionally run large trade and current account surpluses,away from export dependence and toward stronger domestic demandled growth. This entails a range of policy changes, as you can see in thevery broad range of domestic reforms being undertaken by China. An important part of this transition is a gradualappreciation of emerging market currencies relative to the majorcurrencies as a group. And these changes by surplus economies, both emerging andadvanced, need to be complemented by reforms in countries likethe United States to increase savings--including restoring fiscalsustainability-- to shift growth from consumption to investmentand to exports. The adjustments now underway will happen, but if they happenin a framework of international cooperation, they will beachieved with stronger overall global growth rates, less risk offinancial instability, and less protectionist pressures at thenational level. The framework of cooperation we agreed to today recognizesthat none of us can accomplish this alone. This is inherently a multilateral challenge. I want to emphasize three key points: "First, we have agreed that it is important to limit theoverall level of external imbalances across the global economy. Those imbalances are lower today than they were before thecrisis.  Where they are still high, it is important that weimplement sound policies, consistent with reducing imbalances,and to prevent them from expanding again to levels that couldthreaten future growth and stability. Second, we have agreed to cooperate more closely on exchangerate policy.  Countries with significantly undervalued exchangerates committed to move towards more market-determinedexchange-rate systems that reflect economic fundamentals, asChina is now doing. The countries responsible for the dollar, euro and yenrecognized the importance of preserving stability among the majorcurrencies and avoiding excess volatility and disorderly exchangerate movements. We all committed to refrain from competitivedevaluation, or undervaluation. Together, these commitments should help reduce some of thepressure being experienced by those emerging economies that areappropriately running more flexible exchange rate systems andhave already seen their currencies move significantly higher. Third, we agreed to give a greater role to the IMF inimplementing these commitments. The IMF was created to play this role, but its ability to doso in practice has been constrained by the reluctance of itsmembers to expose themselves to a candid, independent, externalassessment of the effects of their policies on the global economyas a whole, and to allow the IMF staff and management to offerbroad judgments on exchange rate misalignments. This must change, and we want to see the IMF act on themandate it received here today. This is important, for without a strong, independentmechanism for encouraging cooperation, countries will feel morepressure to take action on their own to protect their interests. The value of this framework to limit trade imbalances is thatrights and responsibilities are aligned and balanced. Countries with surpluses and countries with deficits, theadvanced economies and the large emerging economies, all have aresponsibility to play their part in contributing to stronger andmore sustainable growth. Alongside these changes, we agreed to a very strong set ofreforms to the International Monetary Fund. These changes improve the ability of the IMF to help itsmembers deal with future crises. They change the governancestructure to give emerging economies a greater voice in theinstitution and more seats on the Board. I want to acknowledge in particular the willingness of theEuropeans to make this possible by giving up two of their seats. Together these reforms recognize that greater representationfor the emerging economies in international institutions comeswith greater responsibilities for making the institutions, andthe global economy, work better. We were honored to have South Korea's President Lee Myung-Bakcome to Gyeongju and we appreciate the role of the Koreanpresidency in helping us all achieve the concrete outcomes of themeetings. Thank you." (Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Ed Lane and TomaszJanowski)             ]]></raw>
