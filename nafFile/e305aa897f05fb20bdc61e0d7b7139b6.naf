<raw><![CDATA[ * Greece taps market in first test of euro zone support deal * Borrowing costs stay high despite European-IMF rescue plan * Demand softer due to shorter maturity, thin Easter market * IMF chief says "perfect harmony" with EU on Greece (Adds Fitch, Strauss-Kahn comments to Reuters, euro lifted) By George Georgiopoulos and George Matlock ATHENS/LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Debt-stricken Greece wonlittle respite from crippling borrowing costs when it returnedto capital markets on Monday for the first time since euro zoneleaders agreed to give it a last-resort financial safety net. A 7-year, 5 billion euro ($6.72 billion) benchmark bondissue was a first test of market confidence after the 16-nationcurrency area decided last week on a fuzzy European-IMF supportmechanism to be used in dire emergencies only. It drew significantly less demand than two previous heavilyoversubscribed Greek 10-year bonds, partly due to the shortermaturity and thin Easter market but also because of expectationsthat Greek bond yields are not about to fall. "We are pleased to have had a successful 5 billion eurotransaction in a maturity that is not plain vanilla," Greece'sdebt agency chief, Petros Christodoulou, told Reuters. The bond carried a coupon of 5.9 percent -- more than twicewhat Germany, Europe's biggest economy and most trusted issuer,pays on 7-year paper. Analysts said the rate had barely eased since Greece issueda longer 10-year bond on Mar. 11, while euro zone partners werestill wrangling over whether to help Athens at all.  However, it might have been higher still had euro zoneleaders failed to reach any decision last week. The euro gainedground further against major currencies on Monday after theagreement relieved fears of a deeper crisis. "The (euro zone) statement was positive for Greece' creditprofile by enhancing its near-term financing options andflexibility as well as reaffirming the support of euro areamember states for economic and fiscal reform in Greece," FitchRatings agency said in a statement. But Fitch kept its negative outlook on Athens' credit ratingbecause of uncertainty over the medium-term fiscal adjustmentand "lack of clarity over the fiscal financing strategy". Greece needs to finance some 23 billion euros in maturingdebt by end May, some of which may be met from cash reserves.The premium investors charge for holding Greek bonds rather thanGerman Bunds widened to 318 basis points at one point on Monday. Officials have said such levels would be "unsustainable" forstate finances in the long run.  IMF TACITURN The head of the International Monetary Fund, which has saidlittle since it was assigned a subordinate role in any rescue,said on Monday there was no immediate sign that Greece wouldneed outside help. The conspicuous silence from Washington since the Europeansagreed to seek its involvement had prompted speculation that theIMF either did not know what role it is supposed to play or wasunhappy at being expected to provide funds but not set policy. Asked if the IMF knew what its role would be, ManagingDirector Dominique Strauss-Kahn said "certainly", adding: "Weare always in perfect harmony with the EU." "We will move and we will say something only when Greeceasks us," he told Reuters in an interview on a visit to Poland. He also said the crisis over Greece's deficit and debt hadexposed weaknesses within the single currency zone, showing thateconomic leadership in the EU is not strong enough and bettercoordination was urgently needed. Under a compromise brokered by euro co-founders Germany andFrance last Thursday, Greece would qualify for assistance onlyif it were unable to borrow on the markets, and a unanimous eurozone decision would be required to trigger a rescue. Euro zone states would provide the majority, some saidtwo-thirds, of help in coordinated bilateral loans, on strictconditions proposed by the European Commission and the EuropeanCentral Bank, while the IMF would provide the rest. However, many key details remain to be spelled out,including the cost of emergency loans, what precise role the IMFwould play and what would happen to its normal conditionality. Greek officials have said that if Athens has to borrow itstotal requirement of 53 billion euros this year at currentmarket rates, it would cost at least an extra 500 million eurosa year in debt service charges. That would make it even harder for the government to achievea promised 4 percentage point cut in the budget deficit to 8.7percent of gross domestic product this year and get theshortfall below the EU limit of 3 percent by the end of 2012. "Beyond 2010 our economists are concerned that Greeceremains on a sustainable debt trajectory," said Ciaran O'Hagan,bond strategist at Societe Generale in Paris. "Debt service costs will continue to rise unless yieldsdecline significantly. At the very least this suggests that thecurrent target to reduce the deficit to 3 percent in three yearsis unrealistic. So we'll face today's concerns next year and theyear after," he added. The Economist magazine calculated Greece would not reach thedeficit target until 2014, by which time its debt to GDP ratiowould have topped 150 percent, compared to 110 percent in 2009.
