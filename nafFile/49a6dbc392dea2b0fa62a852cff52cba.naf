<raw><![CDATA[ By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - With the global economy slowing,interest rates about as low as they can go, governments gettingaustere and banks being investigated for stress, it is gettingharder for investors to keep putting on their bullish faces. Heading into the first full week of the second half,investors are still committed to riskier assets such as equitiesand high-yield bonds in their portfolios, but are being batteredwith questions about whether this is the right stance. Reuters asset alloction polls for June showed investorscutting stocks a bit, but retaining a long-held overweight biastowards them. They also moved into the riskier end of bonds, seekingyield. But markets themselves are telling another story. After a brief rally early last month, world stocks havefallen almost steadily. What was shaping up to be a gain onFriday was only the second up day in nine sessions that haveseen stocks lose around 8 percent. At the same time, bond yields are painting a picture of deepconcern about the future. Citi's composite world bond yield isonly 1.8 percent, while short-term U.S. and euro zone yields  are only 0.6 percent. "There is growing concern over the possibility of adouble-dip recession in developed markets," said Rob Carnell,chief international economist at ING Commerical Banking. "In consequence, people want to keep their money as liquidas possible in case things start to turn down." Just about everything has been turning down from bondyields, to stocks, economic indicators and the Baltic FreightIndex, a proxy for world trade. Friday's U.S. jobs data will have done nothing to easeconcerns, given that private employment gains were less thanexpected and that jobs are a lagging indicator.  ARMAGEDDON? There are two implications from this. Either investorsbanking on a stock revival are wrongly positioned or bond yieldsare wrong pricing in something approaching an investment andeconomic Armageddon. Fred Goodwin, the "Mr Macro" analyst at a Nomura, leans tothe latter. He says that once a recovery has begun to take hold,as now, double-dip recessions are very rare. The one in 1980-82,he reckons, only came about after the Federal Reserve had raisedinterest rates closer to 10 percent. "Positioning (now) for the double-dip, a Japan scenario, or aDepression does not offer compelling risk-reward at theselevels of bond yields," Goodwin said in a note. Others are similarly unimpressed by the idea that anotherrecession is on the way, particularly when it comes to corporateearnings performance, the main driver behind stock movements. "A number of factors have been in place preceding previousglobal earnings recessions including an inverted global yieldcurve, excess inventories and unsustainably high profitability.None of these factors are apparent now," Citi equity strategistssaid in a note. That said, it is hard to see where investors would findgrounds to be bullish if the current recovery slowdown --epitomised by the lastest manufacturing surveys -- starts gainmomentum. Reliance on Chinese and other emerging market growth couldhardly be guaranteed if their main commercial markets started toretrench. And deflation fears are growing enough to prompt investorssuch as those at HSBC's absolute returns team to buy 25- and30-year bonds. They want to grab a near 4 percent yield theyexpect will soon fall as demand drives the price higher. STRESS The week ahead is not likely to offer much that will helpinvestors make up their minds about the future. The Bank of England and European Central Bank hold separatemeetings, but both are likely to keep interest rates on hold. Germany will also auction some 10-year Bunds on Wednesday.Some auctions have been disappointing because record low yieldshave put people off. But this auction is expected to attract plenty of buyersbecause of a massive amount of cash that will be returned toBund investor the same week from other maturing German issues. Austria might provide a better stress test, when it auctions1.3 billion euros of benchmark bonds on Tuesday. The country ishighly exposed to debt-stricken Hungary and is seen by marketsas riskier than Germany and other core euro zone sovereigns. Investors, meanwhile, will also be looking for any earlyresults from the European Commission's stress tests on Europeanbanks, designed to see how they would cope with crises. Results for some of the biggest banks will be given to EUfinance ministers on July 13 but leaks or announcements couldcome before then, especially about German regional and Spanishsavings banks.
