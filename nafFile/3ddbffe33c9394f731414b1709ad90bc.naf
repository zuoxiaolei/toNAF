<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – Last week saw New Zealand’s dollar close sharply lower against its U.S. counterpart after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand indicated that interest rates will remain on hold until well into 2011.NZD/USD hit 0.7432 on Wednesday, the pair’s lowest since December 1; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.7475 by close of trade on Friday, plunging 2.06% over the week.The pair is likely to find support at 0.7432, last Wednesday’s low and resistance at 0.7665, last Tuesday’s high.On Thursday, the RBNZ left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 3.0% in line with expectations. In a statement, the bank’s governor, Alan Bollard said, "Interest rates are now projected to rise to a more limited extent over the next two years than signaled in September.”The bank cut forecasts for consumption and gross domestic product because of the effects of the earthquake that struck close to the South Island city of Christchurch in early September.Earlier in the week, the greenback posted sharp gains after U.S. President Barak Obama said he would accept lower tax rates on high earners for the next two years in exchange for extending federal unemployment insurance and a one-year cut in payroll taxes. The move triggered selling of fixed-income securities and led to a sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields. Higher bond yields tend to boost the greenback as they increase the return on dollar-denominated assets.The greenback was also supported by a string of better-than-expected U.S. data. On Friday, the Commerce Department said the U.S. trade deficit narrowed 13% to USD38.7 billion in October, the smallest since January, as exports rose to a two-year high. Separate U.S. data released last week showed that jobless benefits decreased and consumer sentiment climbed. In the week ahead, the Federal Reserve is expected to announce its benchmark interest rate on Tuesday, while the U.S. is to publish official data on inflation, retail sales and building permits, as well as a weekly report on initial jobless claims.
