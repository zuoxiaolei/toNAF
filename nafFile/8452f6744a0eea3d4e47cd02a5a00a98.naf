<raw><![CDATA[   * Dollar hits lowest in 10 months vs currency basket * Risk appetite rises after manufacturing data worldwide * Euro trades more than 1 percent higher, above $1.44 * Sterling, Aussie, kiwi, loonie hit multi-month highs (Adds comments, details, updates prices) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar on Monday fellagainst a basket of currencies to its lowest since September asa rally in stocks and encouraging economic data from around theworld eroded the greenback's safe-haven appeal. On Wall Street, the broader S&P 500 stock index topped thepsychologically important 1,000 level for the first time innine months. European shares ended at nine-month highs and oilrallied 3 percent to above $71 a barrel. Positive manufacturing reports from the United States,Europe and China lifted hopes about the global economy andboosted risk appetite. That drove the euro to a 2009 high andsterling and the Australian and New Zealand dollars to theirhighest since autumn versus the U.S. currency. "The bulls in the equity markets are winning the war so farand that's really determined the direction for the U.S.dollar," said Gareth Sylvester, senior currency Strategist atHiFX in San Francisco. "So long as equity market interest remains positive, then Ithink the U.S. dollar is going to remain on the back foot." In late New York trading, the ICE Futures dollar index, agauge of the U.S. currency's performance against six othermajor currencies, fell 1 percent to 77.583, having fallen to77.451, its lowest since Sept. 29. The euro hit its highest this year at $1.4445 and was lastat $1.4416, up 1.2 percent on the day, according to Reutersdata. The U.S. currency has come under heavy pressure in recentweeks as positive economic releases and earnings news dried upsafe-haven demand and fueled a rally in stocks, commodities andhigher-yielding currencies. The increase in risk appetite also pushed the yen sharplylower. The dollar rose 0.7 percent to 95.27 yen, while the euroadvanced 1.8 percent to 137.35 yen. RECOVERY HOPES U.S. manufacturing shrank again in July but slower than inJune. The Institute for Supply Management said its index offactory activity rose to 48.9 in July from 44.8 in the priormonth. That was above economists' expectations. A reading below50 indicates contraction. "It's full steam ahead for the recovery," said Alan Ruskin,chief international strategist at RBS Global Banking andMarkets, in Greenwich, Connecticut. "The July ISM data is very much in keeping with a recoverypicking up some momentum, even if the overall index has yet tomake its way out of the contraction zone (below 50)." Earlier, a UK purchasing managers' index showed Britishmanufacturing activity grew last month for the first time sinceMarch 2008, while an equivalent survey on the euro zone showedthe factory sector edged closer to recovery. Sterling rose as high as $1.6986 after earnings news fromHSBC and Barclays boosted bank shares. Adding to the positive sentiment was data out of Chinashowing a measure of manufacturing rose to a one-year high,powered by domestic spending that helped offset anemicexports. Among commodity-linked currencies, the Australian dollarclimbed to a peak of $0.8440 while the New Zealand dollar roseto $0.6687. The Canadian dollar rose as high as C$1.0644 perU.S. dollar. Traders said the Aussie was being supported by expectationsthat the Reserve Bank of Australia may drop a key reference onmonetary policy easing at its meeting on Tuesday while keepingthe cash rate unchanged at 3 percent. "We continue to think a further rate cut is unlikely, andexpect the RBA to be one of the first banks to start tighteningrates with a 50 (basis points) hike next March," Goldman Sachswrote in a research note.
