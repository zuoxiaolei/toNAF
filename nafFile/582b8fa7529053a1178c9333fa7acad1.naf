<raw><![CDATA[ * Greece requests talks with EU, ECB and IMF * Stops short of asking for emergency aid * Greek assets rebound but bond spreads still high (Adds comments from IMF official) By Ingrid Melander and Michael Winfrey ATHENS/WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - Greece asked onThursday for official talks with European authorities and theInternational Monetary Fund, a step toward Athens obtainingbillions of euros in emergency loans. In a letter to the European Union, the European CentralBank and the IMF, Finance Minister George Papaconstantinouproposed discussions on "a multi-year programme of economicpolicies." He said this "could be supported with financial assistancefrom the euro-area member states and the IMF, if the Greekauthorities were to decide to request such assistance." The IMF announced it would send a team to Athens on Monday,which a Greek government official said would be accompanied byteams from the European Commission and the ECB. Greek and IMF officials stressed that Greece, struggling tofinance a national debt greater than its annual economicoutput, had still not decided whether to apply to activate anemergency aid mechanism announced by euro zone governments lastSunday. But IMF spokeswoman Caroline Atkinson said the IMF teamwould focus on Greek policies that could form a basis forloans. "When we're discussing with them the policies that couldform the basis, at a certain point that could mutate into adiscussion for the (financial) arrangement," she said. Sheadded the IMF could work quickly, but declined to give atimeframe. A senior IMF official, speaking on condition of anonymity,said Greece had expressed interest during preliminary talks ina three-year precautionary standby agreement, which it wouldtap only when needed. The official said European financing, part of a joint aidpackage, would have to be assured to trigger IMF funding. TheEuropeans had made it clear that IMF funding should not exceedone-third of any total Greece package although details offinancing had not yet been discussed, the official added. The joint IMF and European mission to Greece from Mondayshould last about 15 days and any agreement would be finalizedshortly afterward by the IMF board, the official noted. Under the aid mechanism, euro zone governments would lendGreece up to 30 billion euros in the initial year and the IMFwould provide more money, perhaps 10 billion euros or more, inwhat could be the biggest international bailout everattempted. Analysts said Greece, which is being forced to pay sky-highborrowing rates in the markets and will need to refinance 8.5billion euros of bonds maturing in May, appeared to be inchingtowards seeking emergency loans. "The fact that they are asking for clarification on variousissues about the mechanism suggests that they are seriouslyconsidering activating the package," said Ben May, an economistat Capital Economics in London. At a cabinet meeting, Greek Prime Minister GeorgePapandreou said his country's debt crisis "has createdpsychological terrorism in our economy and among Greek citizensand we have to deal with that. We must ensure safety andconfidence." GREEK ASSET PRICES News of the request for talks halted a slide in Greek assetprices on Thursday. Greek bank stocks jumped more than 4 percent and the spreadof the 10-year Greek government bond yield over German Bundsfell back to 4.07 percentage points, flat on the day, from anearlier level of 4.35 points. It was still not far from therecord high during the crisis of 4.63 points, hit last week. The markets know that even if Greece does obtain emergencyaid, it may still face several years of economic pain andinstability as austerity measures worsen its deep recession. Euro zone governments have said they would extendthree-year emergency loans at a rate of about 5.0 percent,cheaper than the current yield of 7.0 percent on Greekthree-year bonds. Atkinson said any IMF aid to Greece beyondroughly 3 billion euros would carry an interest charge of 3.26percent. Strict conditions for Greece to slash its budget deficitover several years would be attached to the loans. But any decision to provide the euro zone loans would haveto be made unanimously by all 16 governments in the zone, andmarkets worry that Germany, where public opinion is stronglyagainst helping Greece, might block or delay the aid. EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehnsaid on Thursday that he was confident Germany would step in tohelp if needed, adding: "there will be no default" by Greece. But billionaire financier George Soros said the euro andthe EU itself would be at risk of breaking up if Germanyrefused to play its traditional role binding the regiontogether. "The Germans have always made the concessions needed toadvance the European Union, when people were looking for adeal. Not any more," Soros told Corriere della Sera in aninterview published on Thursday. EURO ZONE TO MEET Euro zone finance ministers were due on Friday to start twodays of meetings in Madrid that would discuss Greece's economicplight, as well as ways to improve coordination of economicpolicies in the zone and reduce the wide economic imbalancesthat contributed to the Greek crisis. Jean-Claude Juncker, who heads the group of financeministers, said the EU might have to reform its core treaty toprevent new fiscal crises. "We have resorted to these loans (for Greece) because therewas no other solution within the European Treaty," Juncker wasquoted as saying by Spanish newspaper Expansion. "For the future we will have to install a Europeanmechanism without allowing some member states to relax and notbalance their books." In an effort to improve its fund-raising by broadening itsinvestor base, Greece has said it intends to sell a U.S. dollarbond and conduct a roadshow for U.S. money managers. Themarkets think such a bond might raise around $2 billion or $3billion. Morgan Stanley will serve as lead underwriter for thedollar bond sale, which will start with a roadshow sometimeafter April 20, a source close to the deal told Reuters onThursday.
