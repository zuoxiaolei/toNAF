<raw><![CDATA[ * Banks borrow 131.9 bln euros from ECB, less than expected * Swiss franc falls as Hungary plans new IMF deal * U.S. private sector adds fewer jobs than expected (Recasts, adds quotes, updates prices, adds details) By Nick Olivari NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - The euro rose across theboard on Wednesday after banks borrowed less money thanexpected from the European Central Bank, easing concerns overEuropean banks' funding issues and raising risk appetite. The tender results were keenly awaited as a gauge of howreliant European banks are on ECB emergency funding. Spanish,Portuguese and Greek banks have been the biggest users of thefacilities. The dollar fell against the yen on concerns about theoutlook for the U.S. economy after a report showed U.S. privateemployers added a paltry 13,000 jobs in June, compared with arevised gain of 57,000 in May. The U.S. government's closelywatched monthly nonfarm payrolls data will be released onFriday. The ECB lent banks 131.9 billion euros ($161.4 billion) inthree-month funds, well below expectations of demand of 210billion euros, according to a Reuters poll. Banks face therepayment of close to half a trillion euros in 12-month fundson Thursday. "The euro and everything else popped up on that number,"said Phil Streible, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldcockin Chicago. "The ECB does not see the need to keep rolling thisover." The euro hit a session high of $1.2304 after the ECBtender, according to Reuters data, rebounding from a two-weeklow hit on Tuesday. It last traded at $1.2263, up 0.7 percent. Option dealers are indicating expiries at 1.2300, 1.2320/25and 1.2350 during the day. The single European currency also rose 1.3 percent againststerling. Flows related to the end of the month, quarter and halfyear affected price movements in thin trade, traders said. Against the yen, the euro was up 0.7 percent at 108.63 yen,after hitting an 8-1/2 year low on Tuesday.

"The downside surprise will be seen as taking away from anyupside non-farm payroll surprise and is consistent with a labormarket that is lethargic at best, moribund at worst," said AlanRuskin, head of currency strategy, RBS Global Banking & Marketsin Stamford, Connecticut. RISK STAYS HIGH Market players were cautious ahead of more events thatcould pose a risk for the single currency, including the Germanpresidential election on Wednesday. The German presidential vote will go to a third round afterChancellor Angela Merkel's conservative candidate failed to winan absolute majority in the first round and second rounds. Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank inFrankfurt, said the move raises questions about Merkel'spolitical support and could weigh on the euro. Some euro uncertainty was removed after a draft mandate forbank supervisors indicated European Union bank stress testsshould be widened and conducted so that they address marketconcerns about the exposure of financial institutions tosovereign risk. The Swiss franc fell against the euro after Hungary said itwas eyeing a new precautionary standby loan agreement with theInternational Monetary Fund for 2011. The move alleviated some concerns about Hungary's largestock of franc-denominated debt. Against the Swiss franc, the euro was last up 0.2 percentat 1.3210 francs after hitting a lifetime low of 1.3165 onelectronic trading platform EBS and 1.3164 on Reuters onTuesday.
