<raw><![CDATA[ * U.S. dollar hit across the board, DXY near all-time low * Euro/dollar above $1.46, poised to push towards $1.50 * Risk of profit-taking seen before Easter holiday (Updates prices, adds detail) By Wanfeng Zhou and Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - The dollar tumbled for athird straight day on Thursday as record low interest rates andthe crushing weight of the U.S. budget deficit pushed it closerto an all-time trough against major currencies. The dollar's slide accelerated days after Standard & Poor'sslapped a negative outlook on the United States' top AAA creditrating. The agency said a downgrade was possible if authoritiescan't slash the massive U.S. budget deficit within two years. Investors -- from fund managers to foreign central banksthat hold trillions of dollars in assets -- reacted by optingfor anything but the dollar. "The combination of loose monetary policy and chaos on thefiscal front has people very worried," said Boris Schlossberg,head of research at GFT Forex in New York. "That fear is beingreflected in the dollar." Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief investment officer of top bondmanager PIMCO, which has $1.2 trillion under management, said:"Absent problems elsewhere in the world, history and economicssuggest that America's current fiscal and monetary policystance will put continued pressures on the dollar." The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback against sixadvanced country currencies, fell to 73.735, its lowest levelsince August 2008. Analysts said that sets up a possible runtoward its record low of 70.698 touched in March 2008. The euro soared to a 16-month high above $1.46 beforeeasing to $1.4550, while the dollar fell 0.7 percent to 81.89yen. The Australian dollar rose above $1.07, its highest innearly three decades, as Australia's 4.75 percent interest rateand its role as a supplier of raw materials to booming Asianmarkets attracted investors. Some investors fear a fragile U.S. economic recovery couldsputter if the White House and Congress agree to cut thedeficit with significant spending cuts or tax hikes. That wouldlikely force the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates atrecord lows even as other central banks raise them. "There is no clear sign that the U.S. is going to raiseinterest rates, and that is causing the dollar to depreciate bythe day," said Jonathan Xiong, who helps manage about $30billion at Mellon Capital Management in San Francisco. Underwhelming employment and manufacturing data on Thursdayunderlined the sluggish nature of the U.S. recovery and thedifficulty facing the Fed, traders said. STRONG DOLLAR POLICY? The European Central Bank raised interest rates this monthfor the first time since 2008 and is expected to do so again.Investors also expect currencies in China and other emergingmarkets to rise more quickly as authorities start relying moreon stronger exchange rates to offset inflation. Analysts said the euro was on course for a move toward$1.50 if the current momentum continues, despite thepossibility of a Greek debt restructuring. Talk that China may invest in Spain had investors shruggingoff worries for now about euro zone debt. "I don't think the U.S. is actively seeking a weakerdollar, but they're not unhappy with it either," Brown BrothersHarriman strategist Win Thin told Reuters Insider. "At themargins, it certainly helps exports and helps growth. As longas asset markets hold up, I think they're OK with this." But some global investors may not keep blindly buying U.S.assets that carry increasingly more risk but persistently lowreturns. "At some point along the line, people are going to realizeit's absurd to lend money to the United States government at 30years in U.S. dollars at 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 percent interest,"influential investor Jim Rogers told Reuters Insider. While, the 30-year Treasury bond yield remainedhistorically low at 4.47 percent, debt-strapped euro zonecountries such as Greece have to pay nearly four times thatjust to borrow money for five years.
