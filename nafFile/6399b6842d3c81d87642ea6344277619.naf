<raw><![CDATA[ * Fisheries subsidies talks depend on overall WTO deal * Overfishing threatens key protein source for humanity  By Jonathan Lynn GENEVA, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Proposals to rescue collapsingfish stocks by restricting fisheries subsidies are under threatbecause of the lack of progress in global trade talks,environmental campaigners said on Thursday. The talks on fisheries subsidies are part of the World TradeOrganisation's Doha round to reform global commerce rules, whichis showing few signs of movement despite an intensive workprogramme agreed by negotiators for the final months of 2009. "We're very concerned," said Michael Hirshfield, chiefscientist at Oceana, a U.S.-based group that campaigns toprotect the world's oceans.  "We're in a sense hostage to the broader negotiation," hetold Reuters while in Geneva to lobby trade negotiators whosetalks this week have been focused on fisheries subsidies. According to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organisation,more than 80 percent of the world's fisheries are overexploited,fully exploited, depleted or recovering. Oceana says that 63 percent of fish stocks worldwide requirerebuilding, while more than 1 billion people depend on fish as akey source of protein.  OVERCAPACITY, OVERFISHING A 2006 study by the University of British Colombia foundthat global fisheries subsidies amount to $30-34 billion a year. Of that total, about $20 billion increases the capacity offleets to fish longer, harder and further away. The WTO fisheries negotiations aim to restrict suchsubsidies. But countries with large industrial fishing fleets --such as China, Japan and South Korea -- are reluctant to cuttheir supports. Many developing nations with subsistencefishermen such as India and African states are also wary. Hirshfield said it was important to distinguish betweendifferent types of fishing. Helping someone in an un-motorisedcraft fishing in coastal waters for himself or for sale locallyby providing ice or docks would not add to overfishing. But providing cheap fuel to industrial fleets to go aroundthe world for fish as an economic commodity was more dangerous. Geneva negotiators told Oceana the overall Doha talks wouldnot move until the United States got more involved, he said. "The question is whether it's sufficient for the UnitedStates to re-engage or whether other countries or otherobstacles will magically appear once the U.S. is eliminated asan excuse," he said. "We just think that it's critical for the WTO to includereal reductions in global fishery subsides in any deal that isreached," he said. Julie Packard, head of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, saidgrowing consumer awareness of overfishing was leading foodprocessors and retailers, like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and AramarkInc, to commit to source food from sustainable fisheries. Packard said it was not all bad news in the oceans and somestocks were recovering with the right treatment.  "The oceans are resilient. If we just lay off fishing for awhile they're going to recover," she said. (Editing by Erik Kirschbaum)             ]]></raw>
