<raw><![CDATA[ * Gov't underestimating size of bank restructuring - Moody's * Likely to cost 40-50 billion euros  * Doubts govt able to ensure regional deficit compliance * Euro weakens versus dollar  (adds details) MADRID, March 10 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's cutSpain's sovereign debt rating one notch on Thursday and warnedof further cuts due to fears that bank restructuring will likelycost more than twice what the government expects. "(Moody's) believes there is a meaningful risk that theeventual cost of the recapitalization effort could considerablyexceed the government's current projections," it said in astatement. Moody's still rates Spain -- one of the countries now in thefiring line in Europe's debt crisis -- as a high gradeinvestment proposition. By way of comparison, the agency ratesPortugal two notches lower and Greece far down with junk status. The ratings agency said the overall cost of recapitalisingstruggling banks was likely to be nearer to 40 billion euros,double the government's estimate. In a more stressed scenariorecapitalization needs could even rise to around 110 to 120billion euros, it said. The cut in the rating -- to Aa2 from Aa1 -- drove the euroto session lows against the dollar and the premium investorscharge for Spanish 10-year debt instead of German Bunds widened9 basis points on the day to 232 bps. "This is clearly negative. I'm not sure up to what point,but it will certainly impact the banks. Obviously the directconsequence is that it will be harder and more expensive (forbanks) to access financing," said Juan Rodriguez Rey, an analystat Banco Sabadell. Moody's also noted that nine of the country's 17 autonomousregions breached budget deficit targets.  "This casts doubts over the ability of the centralgovernment to exercise sufficient control over the regions toensure compliance with deficit targets," it said.
