<raw><![CDATA[ * U.S. dollar, yen on softer footing; euro at 3-wk highs * Risk appetite helped by better U.S. data, earnings * Focus on Bernanke's testimony, eyes on exit strategies By Anirban Nag SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, July 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar andthe yen ceded further ground on Monday as concerns about theU.S. economy abated and broadly improved corporate earningslifted risk appetite and regional stock markets. Hopes of better corporate earnings in the U.S. underpinnedregional share markets and saw the MSCI index of Asian Pacificstocks  outside Japan hit a 2009 high. Sentiment was also helped by news that the CIT Group had reached a tentative deal with bondholders whichcould allow it to stave off bankruptcy. [nN15377144]. Volumes were light with Tokyo shut for a local holiday. Thedollar index  -- the dollar against a basket of sixcurrencies -- was down 0.2 percent, having shed 1 percent lastweek, its worst week since May 24. The euro  rose as far as $1.4180, Reuters datashowed, firmer than late Friday's $1.4107 and its highest levelsince July 1. High-yielding currencies such as the Australian  andthe New Zealand dollars  made solid gains, rising about0.6 percent each. The dollar was at 94.56 yen , up from 94.26 lateFriday, while the euro jumped against the yen to its highestsince July 7, trading at around 134 yen. "The earnings and data from the housing sector suggest theU.S. economy is showing signs of a recovery although investorsare still reluctant to pour capital in to it," said RichardGrace, senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank ofAustralia, Sydney. Growing expectations of a recovery in the U.S. economy havesent investors searching for higher yields. Last week, financial stalwarts Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co  reported better-than-expectedresults, although that was offset by news that General Electric profits fell by half and Bank of America  posteda lower quarterly profit. Companies reporting this week include American Express Co, Apple Inc , Boeing Co , Caterpillar Inc, Coca-Cola Co , DuPont Co , McDonald's Corp and Microsoft Corp . FOCUS ON BERNANKE, JAPAN POLITICS While the headline numbers have masked increased job cutsand falling capital expenditure, investors have chosen to paymore attention to the positive economic reports such as asurprising rise in U.S. housing starts in June andstronger-than-expected retail sales. There is little U.S. data to drive the market this week, sothe focus will be on Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke'ssemi-annual monetary policy testimony to Congress. Investors will be seeking clues on whether the Fed willbegin unwinding some of the huge stimulus measures it undertookat the height of the U.S. financial crisis. If that signal comes, investors will perceive it asevidence that the U.S. economy could soon show positive growthand bolster risk appetite. Bernanke may sound more confident about the economy afterthe Fed last week said the recession would not be as deep asfeared in 2009 and the recovery next year may be stronger thanexpected. Still, analysts expect any exit strategy to be cautious andlikely to be carefully managed, given the downside risks fromrising unemployment. "While the chairman needs to articulate how and why exitingthe current stance need not prove destabilizing, he will wantto steer clear of triggering expectations that an active returnto traditional interest rate setting is close at hand," saidRobert DiClemente, economist at Citi. "Over time, we would expect that the greater concern forfinancial markets will not be inflation or monetary policy butthe troubling arithmetic around fiscal sustainability." Another big event this week could be Japanese PrimeMinister Taro Aso's dissolution of parliament's lower house onTuesday for a Aug. 30 election he has already called. The opposition Democratic Party is leading in opinion pollsand if it wins it would end more than 50 years of almostunbroken rule by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The dissolution of the lower house itself would havenegligible impact on the already volatile yen, analysts said. "The bigger focus will be whether a new government inJapan, if that is what results, decides to shift Japan'sreserve investment strategy away from the dollar," said HSBC'shead of strategy in Asia, Richard Yetsenga. "So the dollar itself is likely to be the area of focus." Neither of the two main parties have suggested any changesin Japan's foreign exchange reserves policy. Rintaro Tamaki, Japan's new vice finance minister, has saidthe U.S. dollar will remain the key currency and Japan willsupport that policy. The Democratic Party has likewise said achange in government will not mean the weightage of dollars inJapan's reserves has to change.
