<raw><![CDATA[ * Belarus stays out after energy spat * Putin says door for Belarus, other countries open * Three presidents to meet on July 5  By Darya Korsunskaya MOSCOW, July 1 (Reuters) - Russia and Kazakhstan launchedtheir customs union on Thursday in the first step towardscreating of an ex-Soviet common market for 160 million people,brushing aside criticism from the West over protectionism.  The third ally Belarus, which chose to drop out of theUnion's launch due to the energy trade disputes with Moscow, wasstill welcome to join, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putintold a government session.  "I believe we need to start work in a trilateral format fromthe beginning, with active participation of our Belarussianpartners," Putin said.  "The doors for such integration are open ... Integrationwith neighbours is the historical choice for Russia." Russia and Kazakhstan will from July 1 use a single customscode, although a transition period exists for a range of goods,meaning that the two nations have not completely unified theirtariff legislation. Putin took markets by surprise last year when he said thatRussia was dropping its long-standing bid to join the WorldTrade Organisation (WTO) in favour of the customs union, sayingthe union promised immediate trade benefits for its members.  Russia has this year revived the WTO bid but the prospectsof membership either unilaterally or as part of the union lookunclear.   GAS ROW Since the unveiling of the union plans, the relationshipbetween Russia and Belarus has been marred by trade disputesculminating in last month's "gas war", when Russia cut gassupplies to Belarus, which in turn halted transit to the EU. Some analysts saw the standoff as a way to put pressure onMinsk, which had refused to join the union until Russia dropsduty on oil supplied to Belarus, where it is processed at localrefineries and re-exported at high profit margin.  The Belarus parliament quietly ratified the union's customscode as soon as the gas spat was over and Russian gas firmGazprom agreed to Belarus gas transit terms.  "The creation of the customs union is a complicated processlinked to a labour-consuming and diligent work on hundreds ofpositions ... In the European Union similar processes took manyyears," Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko said. The presidents of the three countries will meet on July 5 todecide whether Russia and Kazakhstan should proceed withoutBelarus, which borders the European Union, Russia's largesttrade partner, already handling much of Russian trade flows.  Russia has used the economic crisis -- which hit it harderthan BRIC emerging market peers Brazil, India and China -- as anexcuse to introduce protectionist measures.  Russia was singled out as on of the worst protectionistoffenders in the G20 group of the world's leading economies, andEU officials have said that the Customs Union is a way to raisemore trade barriers.  Putin has said the cabinet is constantly thinking about newimport duties on finished goods to force foreign firms to set upproduction in Russia and protect fledgling domestic industries.
