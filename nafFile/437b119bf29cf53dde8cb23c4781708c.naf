<raw><![CDATA[   * Bernanke reappointment boosts stocks * Case-Shiller report shows improving U.S. housing sector * No clear direction in thin FX market (Recasts, updates prices, adds U.S. data, changes byline,dateline; previous LONDON) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Tuesday asa recovery in European shares and a rise in U.S. equities onBen Bernanke's reappointment as Federal Reserve chairmanencouraged investors to take on riskier trades. President Barack Obama on Tuesday renominated Bernanke to asecond term as Fed chairman as the U.S. economy attempts tocome out of the worst recession since the Great Depression. The yen, on the other hand, edged higher. It was up moresharply earlier after China's volatile Shanghai Composite Indexfell, but the Japanese currency has since trimmed gains asEuropean shares pulled back from declines and U.S. equitiesopened higher. Jacob Oubina, currency strategist at Forex.com inBedminster, New Jersey said the dollar's weakness could betraced to "gains in equity futures," with investors selling thegreenback as risk appetite improved. "Risk appetite has been the story all year and it will befor some time," Oubina said. A report showing prices of U.S. single-family homes rosefor a second consecutive month in June also boosted risksentiment. The S&P/Case-Shiller composite indexes of 10 and 20metropolitan areas both rose 1.4 percent in June from May,almost three times the 0.5 percent increases of the monthbefore. The Bernanke story has been out for many hours, butcurrency markets were slow to react, with investors mainlytaking their cue from equities. Analysts said the delayedreaction was quite normal in thin summer trading conditions asfinancial markets struggled to seek direction. "Clearly, Mr. Obama's decision (to reappoint Bernanke) hasbeen motivated by a realization that U.S. and global financialmarkets desperately need a sense of stability at a time whenthe banking system still remains vulnerable to furtherwritedowns and credit contractions," said Boris Schlossberg,director of FX research at GFT in New York. Early in the New York session, the euro rose 0.3 percent onthe day at $1.4348, clawing back some losses after slipping tothe day's low of $1.4254 according to Reuters data. It rose ashigh as $1.4361 The euro showed little reaction to figures confirmingGerman's economy grew by 0.3 percent in the second quarter andexited a recession. The ICE Futures' dollar index, a measure of the dollar'svalue against six major currencies, was down 0.4 percent at77.970. Against the yen, the U.S. currency fell as low as 93.80 yenin early trade. The Japanese currency was the main beneficiaryof the pullback in risk demand, but the greenback has sincerecovered to trade at 94.22, still down 0.3 percent from lateon Monday. High-risk currencies struggled against the yen, with sterling down 0.2 percent to 154.86 yen. (Additional reporting Emelia Sithole-Matarise in London;Editing by Kenneth Barry)             ]]></raw>
