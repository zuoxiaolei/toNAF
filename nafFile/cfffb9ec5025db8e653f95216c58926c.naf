<raw><![CDATA[ * S&P 500 lowest since March; Peru's market tumbles * Euro dips on Greece worries; rate hike hopes limit drop * Oil prices fall ahead of OPEC meeting on demand concerns (Updates with U.S. stock close, adds details) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - Major stock markets fell for afourth session on Monday on concerns about slowing globaleconomic growth, while the euro slipped after a German officialsuggested a second Greek bailout was not yet certain. Losses in U.S. and European shares paled in comparison witha more than 10 percent tumble in Peru's stock market after apresidential election victory by left-wing former armycommander Ollanta Humala stoked fears of a roll-back infree-market reforms. Crude oil prices were lower ahead of an OPEC meeting laterthis week, weighed by growing signs that high prices aredestroying energy demand in the West. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index hit a more thantwo-month low after May's weak U.S. labor and manufacturingdata pushed stocks to five weeks of losses. The index is downmore than 5 percent from its May high, but still up nearly 3.0percent for the year. "This seems like a continuation of sentiment from lastweek, where investors are coming to the realization that theeconomy is not growing as strongly as once anticipated," saidWasif Latif, vice president of equity investments at USAAInvestment Management in San Antonio, Texas. "The weak economic data throughout last week corroboratedthose suspicions and because of that you are seeing thecontinuation (of the equities slide)." The Dow Jones industrial average  ended down 61.30points, or 0.50 percent, at 12,089.96. The Standard & Poor's500 Index  was down 13.99 points, or 1.08 percent, at1,286.17. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down 30.22points, or 1.11 percent, at 2,702.56. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300  fell 0.6 percentto 1,104.97, an 11-week closing low. World stocks, as measured by the MSCI world equity index, fell 0.8 percent. The Thomson Reuters globalstock index  dropped 0.9 percent. Emerging marketstocks  shed 0.6 percent. Investors dumped Peru's financial assets, triggeringfreezes in stock trading and a currency intervention by thecentral bank as investors doubted Humala's vows to manage theeconomy prudently. Peru's stock market  sank more than 12 percent,while the sol currency  fell 1.5 percent, prompting thecentral bank to offer to sell about $215 million in depositcertificates aimed at curbing the currency's fall. Joyce Chang, global head of emerging markets research atJPMorgan, said the "market has probably overreacted a bit" andrecommended investors look for buy opportunities in Peruviandebt. "I think that there's probably going to be at this stage ofthe game more positive than negative surprises. We wouldfrankly look for opportunities to add exposure," Chang told theReuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit in New York. GREEK BAILOUT NOT CERTAIN The euro last traded 0.5 percent lower at $1.4566. Itdipped below $1.46  after a spokesman for the Germanfinance ministry said a second aid program for Greece was notyet certain. The currency extended declines after Jean-Claude Juncker,the chairman of euro zone finance ministers, said the euro is"objectively overvalued." Policymakers have inched toward a new bailout package thatGerman media said could exceed 100 billion euros, which helpedthe euro hit a one-month high of $1.4658. Traders said the market assumes a deal will be reached toallow Greece more time to repay its debt and that markets werealready bracing for European Central Bank President Jean-ClaudeTrichet on Thursday to signal plans to raise euro zone interestrates in July. "The focus will turn toward interest rate differentials,and with the Federal Reserve unlikely to do anything this year,an ECB rate hike will pull money toward the euro and othercurrencies," said Boris Schlossberg, head of currency researchat GFT in New York. U.S. crude  closed below $100 a barrel, settling at$99.01, down $1.21, or 1.21 percent. Brent crude oil settled at $114.48 a barrel, down $1.36, or 1.18 percent. Itwas the lowest settlement since May 24, when Brent crude closedat $112.53. At an OPEC meeting this week, the cartel could lift its oilproduction targets, although leading member Saudi Arabia islikely to face tough opposition in its push to raise supplyfrom hawks Venezuela and Iran. Concerns about the economy fueled fresh gains forsafe-haven gold, with spot gold  up 0.1 percent at$1,542.79 an ounce. The metal hit a session high of $1,553.30,its loftiest since early May. yielded4.27 percent, up from 4.23 percent late on Friday, whilebenchmark 10-year Treasury notes  yielded 3.01percent, from 2.99 percent.
