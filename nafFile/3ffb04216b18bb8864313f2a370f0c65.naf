<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro steadies on hopes for Irish aid package support * Options market suggests euro sentiment improving * China tightens by raising bank reserve requirements (Adds quote, updates prices, changes byline) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The euro rose broadly onFriday, gaining for a third straight day versus the dollar, asinvestors grew more confident that Ireland's debt crisis wouldbe resolved. Gains in the euro, however, may prove temporary, withinvestors generally fearful Ireland's problems could spread toother peripheral economies in the euro zone. Hopes that Ireland was near a deal to get tens of billionsof euros from its European partners and the IMF helped push theeuro above $1.37 overnight, although momentum stalled ahead ofresistance around $1.3750. Traders said this level is likely tohold until markets get more details on the Irish rescue plan. In the currency options market, euro sentiment stabilizedfor now. The one-month euro/dollar risk reversal, a barometerof currency sentiment, started to creep higher, suggestinginvestors near-term are starting to get less euro-bearish. The euro's risk reversal still showed a "put" bias, but ithas risen from extremely low levels. On Friday, puts tradedhigher -- a mid-market of -1.175 vols , with bidsat -1.55 vols. On Thursday, bids on euro puts were at -1.60,falling from -2.025 vols early this week, a roughly 2-1/2-monthlow. "The fall-out from the banking crisis will play out inIrish politics and in the economy for years to come. From aglobal perspective, however, the tension in Ireland appears tohave come off the boil and this is lending support to theeuro," said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobankin London. A deal to help Ireland cope with its battered banks will beunveiled next week, EU sources said on Friday. Ireland willpublish the details of a four-year fiscal plan to save 15billion euros at roughly the same time.

It has recovered from a slide to a seven-week lowof $1.3446 earlier in the week and is poised to end the weekslightly lower against the dollar. "This abrupt calming in the markets coincides with anexpected technical correction in the euro," said John RossCrooks III, director of research at Black Swan CapitalManagement in Florida. Right now, Crooks said the euro is likely to pull backtoward its 72-hour moving average at about $1.3600. From there,the euro should go higher to $1.3820 and $1.3975. Some analysts said even if Ireland does get a rescue, theeuro is unlikely to see a big rally. "If there's a bailout forIreland, that's been largely priced in," said Aroop Chatterjee,currency strategist at Barclays Capital in New York. He added that funding concerns and fiscal consolidationwill remain negative for the euro next year. He expects theeuro to rise to $1.38 in one month, before sliding to around$1.30 over 12 months. News overnight that China tightened monetary policy byraising banks' reserve requirements somewhat dented riskappetite. [ID:nL3E6MJ0N8] The impact was felt by higher-yielding commodity-linkedcurrencies such as the Australian dollar. Australia isa large exporter of commodities to China and tends to weaken onworries of a slowdown in the Chinese economy. The Aussie dollarlast traded at down 0.3 percent against the greenback atUS$0.9858.
