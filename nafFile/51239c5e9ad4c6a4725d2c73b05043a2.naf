<raw><![CDATA[ By Yoko Nishikawa TOKYO, March 17 (Reuters) - The current dollar-denominatedglobal reserve system needs to be reformed to better fiteconomic reality and ensure global financial stability, thehead of Asian Development Bank said on Wednesday. ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda also said robust growth indeveloping Asia could prompt a surge in capital inflows to theregion, leaving Asia vulnerable to more volatile exchange ratesand exacerbating trade and other imbalances. That will put more pressure on a global reserve system thatis already scored with fault lines, he added. "That means, more than ever, we need to work together atthe global and regional levels to find solutions, howevergradual in implementation, that will bring about a workablereform of the global reserve system," Kuroda said in aconference in Tokyo. Kuroda's comments follow growing discussions amongpolicymakers and academics that the world should no longer relyon one single, dominant currency, such as the dollar, as it hasdone since the end of the gold standard. Using just one nation's currency for international reservescreates tension between national and global monetary policymaking, said Kuroda, a former Japanese vice finance ministerfor international affairs. Speaking at the same conference, Nobel Prize-winningeconomist Joseph Stiglitz also called for a new global reservesystem, saying the least ambitious option could be a systembased on the Special Drawing Rights (SDR), the InternationalMonetary Fund's in-house unit of account. But Kuroda said the key challenge to this proposal would behow to make this super-sovereign currency commercially viable.To make SDRs work on a global scale, a huge amount ofSDR-denominated bank deposits and bond markets would be needed. Moreover, the value of SDRs must be determined by marketsand the IMF would have to be given more power andresponsibility to control the supply of SDRs in open markets,Kuroda said."This system could be a far better system than the currentsystem but at this moment the international community is notyet prepared to do so," Kuroda said. Greece's debt crisis has made it clear that the euro is not yet a currency with a solid sovereign backbone, despitesuggestions that it has become a serious rival to the U.S.dollar as a reserve currency, he added. A more convertible Chinese yuan  could at somepoint qualify as a reserve currency, initially within Asia. Butto do so, China will need to further liberalise its capitalaccount and build broader, open asset markets. ASIA INFLOWS A WORRY Kuroda also reiterated that the ADB would raise itsDecember forecast of 6.6 percent growth for developing Asianext month, but added there were risks to the outlook. As developing Asia grows faster than advanced economies andattracts investors, capital inflows to the region will surge,pushing up currencies and making them more volatile, he said. "That could seriously damage the medium-term economicoutlook for Asia, if the existing international monetary systemallows for unfettered capital jolts."
