<raw><![CDATA[ Jan 28 (Reuters) - Egypt's financial markets have beenbadly shaken since the biggest anti-government demonstrations ofPresident Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule broke out on Tuesday. Here are some facts about the main markets: THE EGYPTIAN POUND The Egyptian pound, which weakened to a six-year low aftertwo days of protests, is entirely convertible, but the centralbank tightly manages its movements against the dollar with aview to maintaining stability, allowing it to fluctuategradually to reflect demand and supply. Currency traders say thebank often intervenes indirectly to maintain the currency atpreferred levels via two commercial banks, Suez Canal Bank, which receives dollar receipts from the Suez CanalAuthority, and Arab African International Bank, whose capital ispartly held in dollars. Traders say the central bank made a raredirect intervention in December 2009 to keep the currency fromweakening below 5.70 to the dollar, but there has been no signof direct intervention since the current protests began. Itweakened to 5.855 on Thursday, the last trading day before theEgyptian weekend. The pound would come under particularly strong pressure ifforeign and Egyptian investors were to accelerate the sale oftheir equity and treasuries holdings. One trader in the treasuryroom of a bank said several business executives had transferredfunds abroad. Some of Egypt's leading businesses executives haveclose links to the ruling party.  THE EGYPTIAN STOCK EXCHANGE Egypt's benchmark index of 30 shares  tumbled 7percent in four days after Tunisia's president was ousted frompower, then fell another 16 percent in two days following theoutbreak of protests in Egypt on Tuesday. Because of itsrelatively large size and sophistication, Egypt is heavilyweighted in many investment funds dedicated to the Middle Eastand Africa, which tend to invest in a handful of blue chips suchas Orascom Construction Industries  and CommercialInternational Bank . Local retail investors, who tendto invest more speculatively and in smaller companies, areparticularly well represented in the market, and in the dayssince the Tunisian president's ouster the more broadly basedindex of 100 shares  has tumbled even faster than themain index, losing 29 percent.  GOVERNMENT FIXED INCOME Holdings of treasury bills by foreigners soared over thepast year as investors took advantage of a flood of cheapdollars to buy Egyptian government paper, especially shorterterm T-bills that carry yields of around 9 or 10 percent. As ofthe end of November, foreigners held 61.30 billion Egyptianpounds ($10.5 billion) worth of the country's 274 billionEgyptian pounds in outstanding bills. Analysts say the lack ofan active secondary market has dampened the appetite forgovernment paper, especially longer maturities, forcing thegovernment to add a risk premium that has pushed up its cost offunding. The development of secondary trading has been hinderedby rules that allow only 15 commercial banks to buy treasurybills and bonds directly from the government, an arrangementthat has allowed them to use their deposits to sit on easy andtraditionally risk-free sovereign debt [ID:nLDE6670ZF]. Thegovernment also had treasury bonds worth 199.2 billion poundsoutstanding as of the end of November, with various maturitiesof up to 20 years. It is too early to gauge the impact on treasury bills, whichmany investors hold to maturity, but an increased yield of 40basis points to an average of 10.62 percent at an auction of182-day bills on Thursday suggests the central bank is having topay more to attract buyers. CORPORATE BONDS Only a handful of Egyptian firms -- Mobinil , EzzSteel , GB Auto  and Orascom ConstructionIndustries (OCIC.CA> -- have bonds outstanding, and these tradeinfrequently. The government has taken a number of steps overthe past year to make it easier to issue bonds, including thesimplification of the regulatory process and the introduction ofa rule allowing corporations to issue bonds in batches.[ID:nLDE60R27K]  CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS The cost of insuring Egyptian debt against default jumpedafter demonstrations began on Tuesday. During the crisisEgyptian five-year credit default swaps (CDS) have risen to 405basis points, the highest since April 2009, data from Markitshowed on Friday. They traded at 320 bps on Jan 17.
