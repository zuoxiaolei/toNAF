<raw><![CDATA[ * Consumer sentiment to decline for fifth straight month * Concern over first quarter due to harsh winter   (Adds detail, background) By Sarah Marsh BERLIN, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Germany's economic recoverystalled in the fourth quarter of 2009, as weak consumption and aliquidation of inventories offset firmer exports, leavingEurope's largest economy on a weak footing going into 2010. German gross domestic product (GDP) was unchanged in thefourth quarter of 2009, the Federal Statistics Office said onWednesday, after expanding in the previous two quarters. Separately, the GfK market research group said consumermorale is likely to decline going into March as worries over theeconomy dent income expectations and willingness to spend. "It looks as if the German economy has fallen intohibernation: stagnating growth in the fourth quarter andyesterday's weakening Ifo index," said Carsten Brzeski, aneconomist ING Financial Markets. "However, looks can be deceiving. The underlying trendremains healthy. Demand for German products remains strong." Germany, which is heavily dependent on foreign trade forgrowth, was hit especially hard by the global crisis last year,when the economy shrank by a record five percent. The economy pulled out of a recession in the second quarterof 2009 before stalling in the fourth quarter, and recentforward-looking data indicates the recovery will be rocky. Data from the Ifo economic think tank on Tuesday showedbusiness sentiment falling for the first time in almost a yearin February, suggesting a harsh winter may send Germany slidingback into the red in the first quarter. "German GDP will probably contract in the first quarter,then we should see a recovery. However, there will be bumpsalong the way," said WestLB analyst Joerg Lueschow. Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said he was not surprisedby the fall in German business morale, and that the countrystill does not have a self-sustaining recovery. The decline in business sentiment mirrored a drop in Germananalyst and investor sentiment in February, which came againstthe backdrop of market jitters about Greece's debt woes and thepotential reverberations through the euro zone.  EXPORTS RISE The GfK drop was the fifth in a row for the indicator, butthe fall was slightly above the Reuters consensus forecast. Private consumption subtracted 0.6 points from GDP in theOctober-December period, the Statistics Office said, while aliquidation in inventories subtracted 1.2 points. However, analysts said demand for German products remainedstrong and the economy could well make up any ground it losesover the winter later this year. Net trade added two percentage points to GDP in the fourthquarter as imports fell and exports jumped. German exports rose3.0 percent on the month in December, pushing foreign demandabove the year-ago level for the first time in 14 months. "This is a classic story for the German economy. Finaldomestic demand remains very weak and it is left to the boomingexport sector to keep the economy afloat," said Nick Kounis,chief European economist at Fortis Bank. "This basic picture will remain in place this year, althoughrecent data may over-state the weakness in the economy asactivity on the high street and on building sites has probablybeen depressed by the poor weather." Year-on-year, the economy shrank by 1.7 percent in thefourth quarter, the data showed, following a 4.7 percent drop inthe July-September period, matching preliminary estimates. Adjusted for working days, German GDP contracted by 2.4percent on the year in the fourth quarter. (Additional reporting by Dave Graham; Editing by StephenNisbet)             ]]></raw>
