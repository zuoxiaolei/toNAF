<raw><![CDATA[* European shares, euro near flat in cautious trade * EU summit begins, Spain pays premium at bond auction * Euro zone peripheral bonds dip * Treasuries win some reprieve from recent sell-off  By Neal Armstrong LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - European shares shed early gainsand peripheral euro zone bonds dipped on Thursday after Spainpaid a high premium at a debt auction, ahead of a summit atwhich EU leaders will focus on the region's debt crisis. U.S. Treasury yields eased but held near seven-month highsafter jumping the previous day on a rise in inflationexpectations and the spectre of higher growth and a widerdeficit. EU leaders are meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Fridayfor their end-of-year summit, with efforts to overcome theyear-long debt crisis at the heart of their agenda. Leaders will try to agree how to stop it spreading, withPortugal and Spain in their sights, and discuss changing theEU's treaty to create a permanent crisis-resolution mechanismfrom 2013 and might look at enlarging the existing crisis fund.. Markets are not anticipating any significant developmentsfrom the summit, though any positive news would likely supportthe euro and risk appetite. "Spain is going to be the issue, with the threat of adowngrade, investors will be looking for comments from the EUmeeting," Will Hedden, a sales trader at IG Index, said. "We don't want Spain to get bailed out. If it does, it sendsa big message to investors that if an economy as big as Spain isfragile, then the euro-zone may be a risky place to dobusiness." Spain was forced to pay a hefty premium at its final bondauction of the year on Thursday, in a key test of investorappetite for euro zone peripheral debt a day after Moody's saidit may cut the country's rating.    The Spanish Treasury raised 2.4 billion euros ($3.20billion), within the targeted range of 2-3 billion euros butdisappointing some analyst who expected more debt to be sold.  "In the short term this should reduce pressure on theSpanish market, but I think when one looks at the bigger pictureand considers the small amount sold, with low bid-covers, yet ata high yield, then it seems clear that peripheral markets remainunder pressure and in need of support from policymakers," saidPeter Chatwell, rate strategist at Credit Agricole in London. Government debt yields for Spain as well as Portugal andItaly were pulled higher after the auction, while Bunds tradedin a narrow range with yields little changed on the day.  U.S. YIELDS EASE European stocks gave up earlier gains to trade close to flatat 1,128.79 as shares in southern Europe dipped following theSpanish bond sale.  The euro was up 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.3225after coming under pressure on Wednesday on Moody's Spainwarning, while the dollar was steady versus a basket ofcurrencies. Oil was trading a touch lower at $88.10 and gold rose 0.2percent. In the cash market, the yield on the 10-year U.S. note slidto 3.47 percent after climbing as high as 3.57 percentovernight. The 10-year yield has risen nearly 90 basis points sinceNovember, contributing to a dramatic steepening of the 2-year to10-year yield curve to 282 basis points from 226 basis points atthe beginning of November. That spread is on course for the largest widening in aquarter since the first quarter of 2008. "The market is very difficult now ... but what I do sense isthat we've got down to levels that are technically supportive,"said a trader at a European firm. "It's difficult to sell at this low and initiate a newposition," he added. U.S. equity futures were pointing to a slightly lower open ahead of a raft of U.S. data, with the current account, housingstarts, weekly jobless claims and the Philly Fed BusinessActivity index all set for release.
