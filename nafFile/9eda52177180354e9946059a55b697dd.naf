<raw><![CDATA[   * Euro briefly falls to day's lows after Ireland's ratingcut * Asia stocks fall 1 pct as weak U.S. data weighs * U.S. dollar firm despite concerns about U.S. growth * Bernanke testimony, EU stress test results later in week By Koh Gui Qing SYDNEY, July 19 (Reuters) - The euro extended losses onMonday, pulling further away from two-month highs, afterMoody's cut Ireland's credit rating, highlighting the fragilityof Europe's fiscal health. The euro quickly fell to the day's lows of $1.2868 afterthe rating agency cut Ireland's government bond ratings to Aa2,from Aa1, saying the country had suffered a "significant lossof financial strength." The move came as markets are anxiously awaiting the resultsof stress tests on European banks due out on Friday, and afterthe IMF and EU suspended a review of Hungary's fundingprogramme at the weekend, saying the government must take toughaction to cut its budget deficit. The downgrade added to the gloom in stock markets, whichfell in Europe and Asia as a sharp drop in U.S. consumersentiment fueled worries that its economic recovery may bestalling. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares fell0.4 percent in early trade, while the MSCI index for Asianstocks outside Japan dropped 1.2 percent, its worse dailyperformance this month, as investors sold riskier assets. The Japanese market was shut on Monday for a holiday. "The key issue driving the market at the moment is slowerglobal growth," said George Clapham, head of equities at ArnhemInvestment Management in Australia. Investors who believed the world economy is on shaky groundgot more ammunition for their arguments on Friday after U.S.data showed consumer prices fell for the third straight monthin June while consumer sentiment dropped to a near one-yearlow, the latest in a spate of weak reports. Major U.S. stock indexes slumped as much as 3.1 percent,with the selling spilling over into Asia on Monday. Reflecting investor anxiety about sluggish economic growth,sub-indices for the MSCI Asia ex-Japan share index showedshares in banks and firms that sold non-essential consumergoods were the worse performers. The financial and consumer discretionary sub-indices weredown 1.3 percent each. In Hong Kong, consumer goods exporter Li & Fung fell 2.6percent, while Europe-focused retailer Esprit Holdings was down2.4 percent. But some investors said that while the U.S. economy is nodoubt weak, worries that it may fall back into recession may beoverdone. "It's slowing but it's very unlikely to get a double-diprecession," said Khiem Do, head of the Asia multi-asset groupat Baring Asset Management, which oversees $50 billion. He said he had a slight preference for Asian and Europeanstocks because they seemed cheaper than bonds. Worries another recession may be on the cards have fuelleddemand in recent weeks for bonds, which are deemed a safer bet.For example, two-year U.S. Treasury yields are near recordlows. But there was no missing the weak tone in other markets. Oilprices slipped below $76 a barrel on concerns that U.S. fueldemand may wane, while safe-haven gold eased to $1,192.10 anounce after falling to its lowest in more than a week in theprevious session. EURO AWAITS BANK STRESS TESTS In currency markets, traders said they were not surprisedat the euro's pullback on Monday, saying it had been expectedafter its recent rally, which has been largely attributed toshort covering and weakness in the U.S. dollar. By mid-afternoon in Asia, the euro pared some of its lossesfrom the Ireland downgrade news and traded at $1.2891 down 0.19percent from Friday's levels in New York. For the year, the common currency has shed 10 percent onworries about euro zone sovereign debt levels. That compareswith a 6.7 percent gain in the yen and a 5.3 percent drop insterling Monday's drop in the euro benefitted the U.S. dollar,despite the growing concerns about the U.S. economy. The U.S.dollar index against a basket of other major currencies was up0.2 percent at 82.643. Investors are awaiting semi-annual testimony by U.S.central bank chief Ben Bernanke on Wednesday for his view onwhether the economic recovery is faltering.
