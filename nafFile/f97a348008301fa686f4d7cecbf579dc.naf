<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro recovers from Monday's four-year low vs dollar * Greece gets EU aid; ECB drains funds * Money market strains limiting euro upside (Recasts, updates prices, adds comment, changes byline,changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Nick Olivari NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - The euro rose against thedollar on Tuesday in volatile trade, recovering from the priorsession's four-year low as investors became more optimistic fornow on news that financial aid for Greece was coming through asplanned. Officials said Greece received a 14.5 billion euroemergency loan from the European Union and would use some ofthe money to repay in full an 8.5 billion euro bond maturing onWednesday [nLDE64H0X9]. This helped narrow the 10-year Greek/German government bondyield spread and cut the cost of insuring against a Greekdefault, supporting the euro. Details of the European Central Bank's bond buyingprogramme announced on Monday and its operation to drain extraliquidity created by buying debt also eased concerns the bondpurchases would lead to a form of quantitative easing. All of this prompted some investors to unwind their betsagainst the euro, where short positions reached record levelslast week as concerns grew that austerity measures would hitgrowth in the region. Though the euro gave up some gains around the time of U.S.data releases on housing and inflation, the move was said to bebased more on technicals than events. "The euro has been oversold so there is at least a bouncein the short term," said Carol Hurley, senior market strategistat Lind-Waldock in Chicago. "But longer term, the euro could goto parity (with the dollar), maybe even by the end of theyear." The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.2405 , having hit$1.2234 on Monday. It rose 0.4 percent to 115.12 yen. But the euro has lost more than 13 percent this yearagainst the dollar and yen, making it the worst-performingmajor currency and analysts were mostly of the opinion that theeuro's move higher was probably short-lived. "We believe the 'breather rally' in EUR merely represents aselling opportunity, as the currency will be plagued byausterity in some countries and loan guarantees out of theother countries - hardly a recipe for a buoyant regionaleconomy and/or stronger currency," said TJ Marta, chief marketstrategist at Marta on the Markets LLC. The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 92.74 yen . It fell0.1 percent to 86.086 against a basket of major currencies including the Swedish crown, but stayed not far from87.063 hit on Monday, its highest since March 2009. MONEY MARKET PRESSURE Despite some easing of risk aversion, money markets stillshowed signs of stress, limiting the euro's upside.    "While the worst market fears may have been assuaged to anextent, the risks hanging over the banking sector because ofincreased funding costs and the effects of a potentialsovereign restructuring remain in place," Citi said in a noteto clients. Euro zone finance ministers met in Brussels on Monday tosmooth out details of the 750 billion euro rescue plan theyannounced a week ago.

In U.S. economic news, U.S. housing starts rose more thanexpected in April to touch their highest level since October2008, likely on the back of a home buyer tax credit. Butpermits, seen as a gauge of future housing construction, hit asix-month low, a government report showed on Tuesday.[ID:nCLAIGE606]. A separate report showed U.S. producer prices eased inApril and costs excluding food and energy remained contained,suggesting inflation is not a near-term concern for officialsat the Federal Reserve.
