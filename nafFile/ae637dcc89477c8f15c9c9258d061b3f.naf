<raw><![CDATA[   * Spain, Portugal problems unlike those in Greece-Bruederle* Call for new rules for EU members to get structural help By Rodrigo Viga Gaier RIO DE JANEIRO, April 29 (Reuters) - The fiscal problems ofSpain and Portugal are different from those of Greece, GermanEconomy Minister Rainer Bruederle said on Thursday. Rating agency Standard and Poor's slashed Greek debt tojunk status and downgraded debt from Portugal and Spain thisweek, raising fears that contagion from Greece's fiscal crisiswould spread.  [ID:nLDE63P0LU] and [ID:nLDE63R115] "I look at the situations of Portugal and Spain in adifferent way," Bruederle told reporters in Rio de Janeiro. "On my way back to Germany I'll stop in Lisbon and keeptalking to Portuguese representatives to learn about thesituation in Portugal," he added. Bruederle said the main goal of help from the InternationalMonetary Fund and the European Commission to Greece is tocontain the problems to that country and avoid a spillover toother euro zone nations. "We want to limit the crisis to Greece," Bruederle said. The European Commission was unable to foresee or preventthe Greek fiscal crisis, which has roiled markets for months,because much previous Greek economic data had been incorrect,Bruederle said. "They (Greece) spent outside their means and need to chooseanother path," he said. The German government is pushing for Athens to swallow atough budget austerity plan in order to receive aid -- a driveit hopes will assuage popular resistance in Germany to helpingGreece and also deter other euro zone states from seekinghelp. The euro zone needs new rules to ensure stability,Bruederle said. "We'll have to add other rules and consider the possibilitythat members that don't follow the rules will not receivestructural help from the European Commission and will havetheir voting rights suspended until they return to followingthe rules," he said.
