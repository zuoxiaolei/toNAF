<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro zone economy seen growing 1.1 percent in 2010 * Economists see less risk of double-dip recession * ECB to hold rates at 1.0 percent until Q3 2011  By Jonathan Cable LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - The euro zone's economicrecovery will likely just plod along, forcing the central bankto keep interest rates low, but the chance of a dip back intorecession is fading, according to the latest Reuters poll. Median forecasts from the survey of around 40 economists,taken over the past week, suggest quarterly growth will notexceed 0.4 percent per quarter from here through to the end ofnext year, unchanged from last month's poll. "Moderate growth will persist for a while. The road aheadwill look like a recovery but not like an upswing," saidJens-Oliver Niklasch at LBBW. Economists kept their full-year growth forecast for thecurrent year at 1.1 percent but trimmed their outlook for 2011to a 1.3 percent expansion from 1.4 percent growth. Thatcompares to 2011 forecasts for 2.0 percent growth in majortrading partner Britain and 2.8 percent growth for the UnitedStates. The 16-nation bloc's biggest economy, Germany, is expectedto grow 1.6 percent next year while France is seen growing 1.3percent. The bloc escaped from its deepest recession in post-warhistory in the third quarter of last year, having pumpedbillions of euros into recovery packages. It is expected to havegrown 0.6 percent in the quarter to end-June and fears of adouble-dip appear to be receding. But governments are now faced with the financial headache ofhaving to slash budgets to recoup the cost of the bailout whilesimultaneously preventing a slide back into recession. Meanwhile91 European banks facing stress tests designed to restoreconfidence in the financial sector have put a dampener on moreoptimistic forecasts. But according to around 25 economists in the survey whoanswered an additional question, there is a only a 20 percentchance of a return to recession, down from the one-in-fourchance given last month from a similar sample. "With decent economic growth in the core countries -- mainlyGermany -- a double-dip recession remains a risk and not a basescenario," said Juergen Michels at Citi. A lower euro -- which has been battered by fears over thedebts of Greece and other euro area members and hit a four-yearnadir last month -- and low interest rates are likely to prop upthe modest recovery for the time being, Michels added.  The sluggish growth path will not be helped by risingunemployment, expected to peak at 10.3 percent later this year.Euro zone unemployment held steady at 10 percent in May,slightly less than the 12-year high of 10.1 percent expected.  ECB ON HOLD The outlook means the European Central Bank is not seenraising rates from their record low of 1.0 percent until July2011 at the earliest, in line with a poll taken two weeks ago. Benchmark interest rates are seen rising to 1.25 percent inthe third quarter of 2011 and then rising by 25 basis points toend the year at 1.5 percent, the same as the last poll. Inflation is seen averaging 1.4 percent this year and thennudging up to 1.5 percent in 2011, remaining significantly belowthe central bank's two percent target ceiling. Data released earlier on Wednesday showed prices rose 1.4percent year-on-year in June, compared to 1.6 percent in May.(Polling by Bangalore Polling Unit, additional reporting byShivani Singh; Editing by Ross Finley and Stephen Nisbet)             ]]></raw>
