<raw><![CDATA[ * Emerging shares up for 6th straight session, China boosts * Russian rouble hits new 2009 highs versus currency basket * Taiwan dollar rises despite foreign inflows curb  By Sujata Rao and Sebastian Tong LONDON, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Emerging stocks rose for thesixth straight session on Wednesday, up one percent after strongChinese data while the U.S. dollar's slump to new 15-month lowsfurther burnished the allure of carry trades. As cash kept flowing into emerging markets, Russia's centralbank allowed its rouble to set fresh 2009 highs against itscurrency basket while Taiwan's dollar shrugged off a move to barforeigners from some cash deposits to rise to new three-weekhighs versus the weak greenback. Positive newsflow on the global economy continued in theshape of data showing China's factory output rising to 19-monthhighs. This puts China on track for 8 percent growth this yearand reinforces hopes for the global economic recovery. And Indian data showed car sales in October rose at thefastest clip in over two years, while truck sales -- a keybarometer of industrial activity -- jumped 52 percent, thestrongest expansion since April 2007. "Asia is the one supportive element out there with China andIndia doing well. The (outlook for) G7 economies has been mixedreally. GDP data is not bad but the underlying quality of thefigures suggests the recovery is still fragile," said ZsoltPapp, chief economist emerging Europe at KBC. On Tuesday, top Federal Reserve officials warned that highunemployment and wary consumers are likely to keep the incipientU.S. economic recovery weak and patchy. "There are people who missed the (markets) rally and stilltrying to get in so we may see slightly higher volatility untilyear end across asset classes. The general trend should beslightly positive unless we get news that the recovery is notgonna happen," Papp said. The key MSCI emerging equities index was up 1.1percent by 1145 GMT, bringing gains this week to almost 4percent while emerging sovereign debt spreads were one basispoint tighter to trade at 302 bps over U.S. Treasuries. Romanian shares jumped 2 percent to hit seven-week peakswhile Russian and South African shareshovered at two-week highs Hungarian and Israeli shares rose onepercent to two-week highs  CURRENCIES ADVANCEMost emerging currencies firmed as bets against the U.S.dollar intensified following comments by the Dallas Fedpresident that the greenback's depreciation had been "orderly". In Asia, the Taiwan dollar posted its highest finish sinceOct. 20, despite the central bank's move to bar foreigners fromtime deposits in an effort to fend off appreciation pressures onthe currency. About $15 billion in overseas cash is parked in suchdeposits, positioned for rate rises.  "At face value, this only obstructs one narrow category ofcapital inflow and may have a limited impact - foreigners canstill freely invest in the equity market, for example," HSBCtold clients in a note. "However, this opens the door towards further measures ifthe authorities continue to find discomfort with inflows andappreciation pressure...we should (also) consider the potentialfor similar moves elsewhere in the region," the bank added. But the Taiwan dollar rose further on Monday thanks to $340million in flows into local stocks and news on Chinese data.  Non-deliverable forwards are pricing further appreciation. In the EMEA space, the South African rand was rangeboundafter firming to a new three-week high against the weak dollarwhile Russia's rouble drifted to a fresh 2009 high against itsdollar-euro basket. The currency has risen steadily in recent weeks as oilprices have stayed near $80 a barrel, sparking off Tuesday'swarning from a senior bank official that rouble strength was nota one-way bet. However, the central bank on Wednesday allowed the rouble tostrengthen further, letting it rise to an 11-month peak versusthe dollar. "We are seeing a bit of currency strength across the regionwhich is based more on the weaker dollar than anything else.That is going to be the theme for the next few days -- what thedollar is doing will be key," said KBC's Papp. The Czech crown firmed to a near one-week high versus theeuro while the Hungarian forint was at its strongest against thesingle currency in two weeks. The Polish zloty was up one percent to a six-week highversus the euro. (Reporting by Sujata Rao and Sebastian Tong; Editing by AndyBruce)             ]]></raw>
