<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar down after U.S. jobs report, China export data * Fed's Bullard says rates to stay low, job losses to slow * Aussie rallies on Chinese export data, gold * Swiss franc turns lower after SNB comments  By Jessica Mortimer LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on Mondayin the wake of weak U.S. jobs data and comments from a FederalReserve official that U.S. interest rates are likely to stay lowfor quite some time. But strong Chinese export data boosted optimism that theglobal economy is recovering, led by Asia. This lifted investorappetite for risk which helped the euro and commodity-linkedcurrencies such as the Australian dollar. Data on Friday showed U.S. employers cut 85,000 jobs lastmonth, disappointing many who had expected the U.S. economy tostop losing jobs and offsetting a revision to November payrollsthat showed 4,000 jobs were added.. The dollar extended falls on Monday after St. Louis FederalReserve Bank President James Bullard said rates may remain lowfor quite some time, although he said Fed policy was unlikely tobe pushed off course by December's jobs data. "Expectations of the speed and scale of Fed tighteningreceived a set-back from the weak payrolls numbers," said ChrisTurner, head of currency strategy at ING in London. "At the same time the global recovery story has received ashot in the arm with the quick rebound in Chinese exports. TheFed in no hurry to tighten, Asia is leading the global recoveryso the dollar is weaker across the board". By 0930 GMT, the dollar index was down 0.6 percent at77.004, off its earlier 76.913, its weakest since mid-December. The latest data from the Commodity Futures TradingCommission showed speculators cut U.S. dollar long positions --bets the currency will appreciate -- in the week to Jan 5, andtraders say that trend is likely to pick up. The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.4517 having hit its highestin more than three weeks at $1.4537. The next big resistance isseen around $1.4570 and a break of that would suggest a gradualrecovery towards $1.4800, traders said. The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 92.35 yen. The Australian dollar struck a new five-week high versus theU.S. dollar of $0.9319, buoyed by an unexpected jump in Chineseexport numbers, and rallied to a 26-month high versus the euroof 0.6442 euros. The Aussie was also bolstered by a rise in gold prices. Spotgold rose to a five-week high early on Monday. SWISS FRANC DIPS The Swiss franc turned lower against the euro after SwissNational Bank chairman Philipp Hildebrand said the central bankwould fight any excessive appreciation of the Swiss francagainst the euro. Hildebrand's remarks sparked concern the SNB may interveneto keep its currency from appreciating after the euro earlierhit a 10-month low of around 1.4725 francs.
