MSCI's world equityindex fell 0.1 percent on the day, reversing gains that took itto its highest since early February. European shares were down 0.5 percent. "There is a little bit of uncertainty. The market is stilltrying to make up its mind. This time the bears and the bullsare more or less in equilibrium, but I think that the bears willsoon get the upper hand again," said Philippe Gijsels, head ofresearch at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels. Investors will eye U.S. housing and consumer confidence datadue out later in the day for further clues to global recovery. The dollar was 0.2 percent higher on the day against abasket of currencies. The euro turned lower against the dollar after the GermanIfo institute's business climate index fell to 95.2 in February,lower than forecasts for 96.1..

BERNANKE EYED U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will testify tocongress on the central bank's exit strategies on Wednesday, butspeculation of a near-term rise in U.S. interest rates stemmingfrom a discount rate increase last week has cooled.

The 2/10-year Treasury yield spread held just a basis pointbelow Monday's 291 basis points, which was its widest since thetwo-year maturity first started trading in the 1970s, onexpectations Bernanke would reiterate the central bank wouldkeep rates low for an extended time. San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen was the latestpolicymaker to stress the move to raise the rate on emergencyloans was not a sign for rapid monetary tightening. The U.S. economy still needed extraordinarily low interestrates, as inflation was "undesirably low" and growth wouldlikely be sluggish for several years, she said on Tuesday.
