<raw><![CDATA[   * Greek T-bill auction well covered but with high yield * Analysts say Greece still has tough times ahead * Euro weighed in volatile session on Greek concerns (Recasts, updates prices, adds comment) NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against theeuro on Tuesday after a Greek debt auction showed the marketasked a high price to hold the assets and Greece's fiscalcrisis would continue to weigh on the single currency. Greece passed its first borrowing test since the euro zoneagreed on a potential rescue package but the high premium paidwas a sign it was likely to need financial aid. On Monday, the euro climbed to a near one-month high of$1.3691 after euro zone finance ministers agreed on an aidpackage for Greece, before paring gains as investors soughtclarification about the plan. The dollar also gained on talk among traders that a U.S.think tank report said the Federal Reserve was closer toraising one of its key interest rates."The aid package is a band aid which does not resolve theGreeks' long-term issues," said John McCarthy, director offoreign exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York, of theeuro's wild swings on Tuesday. Midway through a volatile session in New York the euro wastrading at $1.3558, down 0.2 percent on the day and just off asession low of $1.3552 EUR=>. Greece easily sold its allocation of 6-month and 12-monthT-Bills, raising 1.56 billion euros, with the inclusion ofnon-competitive bids, but at a yield which was costly for thedebt-laden country.

However, analysts said attention then shifted to the yieldGreece had to pay -- more than double those paid at auctions inJanuary of bills with similar maturities. "With the Greek bill auction behind it, the market may lacka clear focus, but sentiment towards the euro remains poor,even though there had been some short-covering in the futuresmarket in the most recent reporting week," said Marc Chandler,global head of foreign exchange strategy at Brown BrothersHarriman in New York. Against the yen EURJPY=>, the euro slipped to trade down0.1 percent at 126.50 yen, staying above its overnight low of125.71, hit as investor caution crept in regarding the Greekaid plan. The draft of a policy paper from Japan's ruling party,released early in the European morning, initially put theJapanese currency under pressure before focus shifted to otherrisks and events. The draft suggested the dollar JPY=> should be kept around120 yen. This pushed the greenback to the day's high at 93.42yen. ID:nTKG006692. It last traded up 0.1 percent at 93.31 yen. But it was a also a turbulent session for the dollar/yenpair with the U.S. currency falling to its lowest in two weeksagainst the yen in Asia trading. Some said a report that theBank of Japan may slightly revise up its consumer priceforecast for the next fiscal year helped the yen. Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa later said annualconsumer price falls were expected to narrow as the output gapshrinks but also that the central bank did not rule out anypolicy option.
