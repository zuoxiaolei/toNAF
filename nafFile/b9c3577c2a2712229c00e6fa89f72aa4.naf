<raw><![CDATA[ BEIJING, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Zhou Xiaochuan, head of China'scentral bank, offered a rare elaboration late on Wednesday of hisviews on a range of issues from global currency reform toinflation and hot money. His comments, made in a university lecture and obtained byReuters, were largely academic but help shed light on policythinking in the world's second-largest economy. For a related story, click on [ID:nTOE6BE065] Here are some highlights translated from his talk, along withrelevant background. ON EXCESS LIQUIDITY AND INFLATION * Background: Analysts say that excess cash in the Chinese economy fromhefty trade inflows and a lending surge during the globalfinancial crisis is one of the root causes of inflation's 5.1percent jump in the year to November, a 28-month high. * Zhou's view: He said it was inappropriate to directly compare China'smoney supply with that in the United States, because China has amuch higher savings rate and the United States has more directfinancing. "What is the measure for whether money supply is appropriate?The answer is very clear in modern monetary theory. It is largelythe core consumer price index (CPI)." "Why is the core CPI used? Because there are many otherprices that have little relationship with money, such as theimport prices of commodity prices and price changes caused byweather or other reasons." He said fast money growth during the global financial crisishad been necessary and any fallout could be dealt with. "There will definitely be some over-shooting, but the key isthat you make adjustments in a timely manner when you spot theturning point so that the over-shooting won't be serious." "We started to tighten liquidity long before CPI hit 5.1percent. We have raised banks' required reserves six times thisyear. We paused in the middle of the year because of the debtcrisis in Europe." ON MANAGING CAPITAL INFLOWS * Background: Zhou said last month that China can create "pools" to lock upcapital inflows, leaving the market to speculate about hismeaning. He expanded on the idea in his lecture. * Zhou's view: "A typical pool would be foreign exchange reserves. Butreserves are in fact composed of many parts, and each part can beviewed as a pool as well." "Some pools can cover trade payments. Some pools are reservesfor the future remittance of profits by foreign companies. Theyhave made a lot of investments in China and will someday takeprofits out." "And one pool is for hot money. As long as you get into thepool, I can sterilise 100 percent of the liquidity, so you won'thave any negative impacts on the real economy." "We have to look at the sources of liquidity. If the growthin liquidity comes from a rising trade surplus, foreign capitalinflows or foreign direct investments, you know we have toenhance the sterilisation efforts." "Even without strong inflation pressure, we should still stepup sterilisation... and use the tool (reserve requirements),which should play its role." HIS PROPOSAL FOR A SUPER-SOVEREIGN CURRENCY * Background: In March 2009, Zhou suggested that a beefed-up SpecialDrawing Rights (SDR), the International Monetary Fund's unit ofaccount, could displace the dollar as the world's main reservecurrency. "You can view this as a suggestion or an idea. "Reserve currency (issuing countries) may have a conflictbetween their domestic policies and internationalresponsibilities, so the idea emerged that whether there shouldbe a super-sovereign currency. "You may think it a quite theoretical issue or a very remotething, but the background was quite real." "After the breakout of the financial crisis, and we all knowthe crisis happened on Wall Street, some people tried to blameothers for their own mistakes and tried to shirk theirresponsibilities. "In particular, at the end of 2008 and the start of 2009,there was much noise that China was the source of the financialcrisis, that China's trade surplus had caused a global imbalance. "We find that ridiculous. It's your property bubble, yoursubprime loans, your lax regulation and your business models. Howcan you blame others for all the problems? "I don't think any Chinese person will accept that (blame)." "To a large extent, the initial discussion of a(super-sovereign currency) relates to analysis of the reasons forthe financial crisis and the share of responsibilities. "It won't do any good to just exchange a few words. We haveto present the issues in an analytical way. "However, we do want to discuss what the future internationalmonetary system should look like. It may be remote, but thereshould be some kind of blueprint." (Reporting by Beijing newsroom; Editing by Ken Wills)             ]]></raw>
