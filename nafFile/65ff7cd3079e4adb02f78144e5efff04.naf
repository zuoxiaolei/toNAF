<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was almost unchanged against the Swiss franc in subdued trade on Monday, as markets remained jittery amid ongoing uncertainty over the future of the Federal Reserve's stimulus program.  USD/CHF hit 0.9254 during European morning trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.9263, easing 0.02%.  The pair was likely to find support at 0.9218, the low of August 16 and resistance at 0.9348, the high of August 13.  Investors were looking ahead to the minutes of the Federal Reserve's July meeting, due out on Wednesday, for further indications as to when the central bank may start to unwind its USD85 billion-a-month asset purchase program.Expectations that the Fed may begin tapering as soon as September were boosted late last week after data showed that U.S. weekly jobless claims fell to an almost six year low.  The Swissie was also steady against the euro with EUR/CHF inching 0.06% higher, to hit 1.2355.  The euro remained supported after data last week showed that the euro zone economy returned to growth in the second quarter, emerging from an 18-month recession.             ]]></raw>
