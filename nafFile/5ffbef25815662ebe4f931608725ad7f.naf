<raw><![CDATA[   * Aid included unfair research payments from NASA * Verdict follows WTO ruling against Airbus last year * Both sides claim the edge in world's largest trade row  (Adds EU to appeal) By Tim Hepher and Andrew Callus GENEVA, March 31 (Reuters) - Planemaker Boeing received atleast $5.3 billion of illegal U.S. subsidies, the World TradeOrganization said on Thursday in a dispute that shows no signsof an end to years of inconclusive wrangling. The banned aid included $2.6 billion of research fundingfrom space agency NASA. But a WTO verdict sparked an immediaterow over whether trade judges were right to include more than $2billion of further support on the charge sheet against Boeing. The ruling is the latest chapter in a six-year battlebetween the industry's two giants. The spat has already enteredthe record books as the world's largest and costliest tradedispute. The WTO verdict backs some, but not all, of a tit-for-tatlegal case over Boeing aid brought by the European Union. A separate WTO trade panel condemned European support forBoeing rival Airbus in a parallel case last year. As so often in a row which now extends to 2,000 pages ofcomplex trade court rulings, both sides claimed victory. "This WTO panel report clearly shows that Boeing hasreceived huge subsidies in the past and continues to receivesignificant subsidies today," European Union trade chief KarelDe Gucht said. Airbus, part of European aerospace group EADS, said it hadlost $45 billion in plane sales because of the subsidies. Boeinghas made similar claims about the impact of Airbus subsidies. In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said theruling vindicated a longtime U.S. position that "the subsidiesthe Europeans give to Airbus dwarf anything that the U.S.government does for Boeing". According to the United States, the European subsidies forAirbus faulted by the WTO last year exceeded $20 billion. As the latest telephone book-sized report was wheeled out ofWTO offices in Geneva, the companies at the heart of the disputeopened fire with another salvo of claims through the media. "It's time for Boeing to stop denying or minimizing themassive illegal subsidies it gets," said Rainer Ohler, head ofpublic affairs and communications at Toulouse-based Airbus. Boeing acknowledged receiving $2.7 billion of aid on top ofa dispute that has already been aired, but accused its rival ofdiverting attention from more pernicious types of European aid. "This WTO ruling shatters the convenient myth that Europeangovernments must illegally subsidize Airbus to counter U.S.government assistance to Boeing," said Michael Luttig, executivevice-president and general counsel at Boeing. Speaking in private, however, sources involved in the caseclashed over whether the $5.3 billion figure cited by the WTOagainst Boeing was a fair account of where it went wrong. The figure includes $2.2 billion of export assistance undera previous assistance programme known as Foreign SalesCorporations, which the U.S. says is defunct. "It is interesting but irrelevant," a U.S. source said. A European source said Boeing was still living off thebenefits of the scheme even though it had been scrapped. The WTO judges appeared to shy away from going over groundwell covered in earlier rulings, saying they had nothing to add. Both sides can appeal the ruling, as they did when the WTOfocused on Airbus. That appeal verdict is expected next month. Sources familiar with the case said the EU could appeal asearly as Friday in a tactical move aimed at reducing the timegap between the two cases.  LENGTHY PROCESS The dispute over the $2 trillion plane market is a runningsore in relations between the world's trading superpowers. Most recently, it spilled over into a politically chargedbattle for a contract to supply air tankers to the Pentagon,which was first awarded to Airbus but eventually went to Boeing. The WTO decisions could help determine how not only Airbusand Boeing, but future competitors in China, Russia, Brazil,Japan and Canada, run their fast-growing aircraft sectors. Boeing Chairman Jim McNerney hailed what he called a"dramatic victory" in clarifying rules and suggested this wouldprove helpful as China challenges the Airbus and Boeing duopoly. However, analysts say it could be years before appeals areexhausted and the case can lead to any trade sanctions. "Boeing began its complaint with a strong argument, butEurope's counter-complaint has muddied the waters," saidaircraft analyst Richard Aboulafia of Virgina-based Teal Group. "At the end of the day it won't matter much. Both sides willcontinue to see exactly what they want to see, and will doexactly what they want to do." Even if the WTO verdicts against both sides are upheld, bothsides disagree over what that would mean for the future. The WTO has criticised public loans to Airbus, especiallyfor the world's largest jetliner, the A380 superjumbo. The United States has warned Airbus not to go back to itshost governments -- Britain, France, Germany and Spain -- forsimilarly structured loans for its next plane, the A350.  But an EU official insisted the ability of governments touse the loans system in the future had not been altered.
