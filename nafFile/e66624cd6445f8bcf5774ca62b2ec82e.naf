<raw><![CDATA[ * Macedonia's EU progress delayed by Greek name row * Economic reforms slow to take root * Some say name row an excuse for government inaction  By Kole Casule SKOPJE, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Macedonia's high hopes thatEuropean Union candidacy status would bring foreign investors tokickstart its economy have long since been dashed, and a disputewith Greece over its name is at the heart of the problem. The EU entry process would give Macedonia the framework andimpetus to reform its economy and give investors greaterconfidence that they could make money in the small, poor Balkannation of two million people. But the two-decade old dispute with neighbouring Greece overthe use of the name Macedonia has kept the country on thesidelines of NATO and the EU, and recent attempts by Skopje andAthens to find a compromise have failed. "Macedonia cannot afford to stay in EU's waiting room fortoo long, it could devastate the country," a Western diplomatsaid. Macedonia was granted EU candidate status in 2005 -- a status that fellow applicants Serbia, Albania and Montenegrohave still not achieved -- but Skopje has yet to open membershiptalks due to Greek objections. In 2008, Athens also blocked thecountry's entry into the NATO military alliance. By contrast,Albania and Croatia have already become NATO members. Remaining outside international institutions is clearlytaking a toll on one of Europe's weakest economies. "There is no serious discussion in the country or along-term plan what to do if this situation continues," saidMarjan Nikolov, an expert at the Center for Economic Analysis, anon-governmental organization based in Skopje. Macedonia's economy contracted 0.6 percent in 2009 and 0.9percent in the first quarter of 2010, but grew 0.4 percent inthe second quarter. The International Monetary Fund and the government haveforecast 2 percent economic growth this year, while the centralbank gives a less optimistic view of 0.6 percent. The governmentprojects 3.5 percent growth next year, based on global recoveryspurring Macedonia's metal industry and construction.  RELUCTANT INVESTORS The country badly needs outside investment to boost itsproduction, lower the unemployment rate of around 34 percent andmake its products more competitive on international markets. But foreign investors are reluctant to risk money in acountry that many see as politically unstable and an outsider inEurope. In 2009, foreign direct investment fell to 180 millioneuros ($245 million) from 399 million in 2008 and 506 million in2007. Much of the foreign investment is in the telecom sector,with Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG, Slovenia's Telekom andTelekom Austria Group being the sole three mobile operators. France's Societe Generale and Slovenia's Nova LjubljanskaBanka are among investors in Macedonian banks. Greeks, who have a controlling stake in the country's soleoil refinery OKTA and in its Stopanska Banka, are still thecountry's largest foreign investors. Greece's debt crisis had very little effect on its firms inMacedonia, as its bank in Skopje was well capitalised and it didnot hold Greek government debt or rely on the parent bank forfinancing. The Greek crisis mostly hurt trading, becauselandlocked Macedonia relies on Greek ports for most exports andimports. Some experts say local authorities have used the namedispute as an excuse for lack of progress in reforms. "The last refuge for the government is to say the economicsituation is bad because of Greece. That's simply not true,"said former Finance Minister Xhevdet Hajredini. "The lack offoreign investment comes from bad economic policy." Most of the criticism from EU diplomats is over the lack ofreforms in the judicial system, the rule of law, publicadministration and media freedom -- all critical to foreigninvestors' risk assessment. Diplomats say the current conservative government led byPrime Minister Nikola Gruevski's VMRO-DPMNE party, which holds63 seats in the 120 seat parliament, is reluctant to pushthrough painful reforms, fearing a loss of popular support. Finance Minister Zoran Stavrevski disputes that. "We havevery good results in creating a better business climate. Severalinternational institution have praised us for the reforms, evenranked us as top reformers," he told Reuters. The EU's last review of Macedonia's candidacy, late in 2009,said it had made good progress in fighting corruption. Despitesome problems in enforcing legislation, it recommended entrytalks should start -- a proposal blocked by Greece. (Editing by Adam Tanner/Ruth Pitchford)             ]]></raw>
