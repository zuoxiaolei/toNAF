<raw><![CDATA[  * U.S. GDP data on soft side, raises risk aversion * Traders wary of pushing aggressively before G20 * Euro falls to record low vs swiss franc (Recasts, adds detail, updates prices, adds quote) By Nick Olivari NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - The dollar climbed againstthe euro and fell against the yen on Friday as investors soughtsafety on concerns about euro zone fiscal strains and datashowing soft U.S. economic growth. Funding issues in the euro zone also prompted caution asbanks need to repay some 442 billion euros in one-year loans tothe European Central Bank next week. That was on the back of a U.S. government report thatshowed gross domestic product (GDP) growth slower thanpreviously expected in the first quarter and cuts to estimatesfor business and consumer spending.. Both factors prompted risk aversion. A weekend meeting ofthe Group of 20 rich and developing nations is unlikely toproduce any surprises, analysts say, but added to the overallcautious tone. "A bit of a disappointment with this (GDP) report," saidMatthew Strauss, senior currency strategist, RBC CapitalMarkets in Toronto. "It's on the softer side of expectationsand with the recent slew of soft data from the U.S., itactually supports this week's FOMC cautious statement. It alsosupports a risk-off sentiment in the forex markets." The euro fell as low as $1.2253, off from the day's high of$1.2351. Midway through the New York trading session it hadtrimmed losses to trade around $1.2295, down 0.3 percent. The single currency was on track to fall 1.2 percentagainst the dollar on the week, snapping two straight weeklygains. Against the yen, the euro was down 0.5 percent at 109.84yen, while it hit a lifetime low against the Swiss franc of1.3468 francs, according to Reuters data and electronic tradingplatform EBS. The dollar fell to 89.34 yen down 0.2 percent on the day.It was the fourth straight daily drop of the dollar against theyen and at 1.3 percent for the week, the third straight week ofdeclines, according to Reuters data. Dollar/yen options barriers at 89 yen and below are likelyto check gains for the Japanese currency in the near-term butsome traders said momentum indicated the yen would eventuallytest the year's high of 87.95 yen touched May 6 on electronictrading platform EBS. It touched 88.00 based on Reuters datathat day. G20 EYED Market players were wary of a lack of consensus at the G20summit with open disagreements about how quickly to shrinkgovernment deficits, how best to strengthen banks so they canwithstand any new downturn, and how to harmonize financialregulatory reforms. U.S. lawmakers hammered out a historic overhaul offinancial regulations as dawn broke over Capitol Hill onFriday, handing President Barack Obama a major domestic victoryon the eve of a global summit devoted to financial reform.. Analysts say currency issues were unlikely to come to thefore as China took steps last week to de-peg its currency. "On the G20, I don't expect too much, because the bigannouncement already happened last week wth China saying itwould let its currency strengthen a bit," said John Doyle,senior currency strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.On Friday, China's central bank set the yuan's dailymid-point at 6.7896 per dollar, the highest level since theJuly 2005 revaluation. It meant China has allowed its reference rate to rise 0.6 percent this week.      A U.S. surveyreleased on Friday showing U.S. consumer sentiment rose in Juneto its highest since January 2008 while reports of job losseswere down sharply from a year ago had little impact ontrading..(Additional reporting by Vivianne Rodrigues and Steven CJohnson) (Reporting by Nick Olivari; Editing by Andrew Hay)             ]]></raw>
