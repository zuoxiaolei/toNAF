<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The pound pushed lower against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, after the release of weak U.S. trade balance data, as as investors looked ahead to Thursday’s Bank of England monthly meeting and U.S. data on nonfarm payrolls on Friday.   GBP/USD hit 1.5274 during U.S. morning trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.5276, slipping 0.26%.   Cable was likely to find support at 1.5190, Monday’s low and resistance at 1.5204, Monday’s high and a three week high.Sterling remained supported after data showed that construction output in the U.K. rose to the highest level since October 2012 in May.Markit said the U.K. construction purchasing managers' index rose to 50.8 in May from 49.4 in April, climbing above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction for the first time in six months.Economists had expected the index to improve to 49.6.The report said rising construction output could support economic growth in the second quarter but added that the sector was unlikely to contribute to overall employment levels.The data came one day after a report showing that the U.K.’s manufacturing sector grew at its fastest pace in more than a year in May.   In the U.S., data on Tuesday showed that the U.S. trade deficit widened more-than-expected in April, rising 8.5% to USD40.3 billion.The Commerce Department said U.S. imports rose 2.4% in April to USD227.7 billion, while exports increased 1.2% to USD187.4 billion.  The report came after data on Monday showed that the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in six months in May. The data dampened expectations that the Federal Reserve will start to unwind its USD85 billion-a-month asset purchase program later this year.Sterling was steady against the euro with EUR/GBP inching up 0.03% to 0.8539.                ]]></raw>
