"The U.S. data are going to bedisappointing and the stock market is likely to head lower inthe next one to two months because of the grim economicoutlook." Gloomy reports on U.S. gross domestic product and housinghave raised fears the economy could slip back into a recessionor face a lengthy period of growth too slow to make much of adent in the country's 9.5 percent unemployment rate.
