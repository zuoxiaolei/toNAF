European stock markets followed Asia lower in early trade,with the FTSEurofirst 300  index of leading stockssliding 0.7 percent. S&P 500 futures  were down 0.7percent, pointing to a weaker opening on Wall Street. The Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday that the FederalReserve would probably unveil a programme of U.S. Treasury bondpurchases worth "a few hundred billion dollars", but gave nosource for the report. [ID:nTOE69Q02H] Most currency dealers had expected a Fed policy meetingnext week to opt for more quantitative easing -- essentiallyprinting money to buy assets and pull market rates lower -- butsome believe the dollar already reflects those expectations andthe question of how much easing, and how fast, has kept themedgy. The dollar index against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.5 percent. The euro was down nearly half apercent on the day at $1.3798 , while the dollar was up0.41 percent at 81.73 yen .

[FED/R] "The market has had in mind a figure of $1 trillion or moreand we had been in a situation where that had led to dollarweakness," said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist Japanfor Barclays Capital. [ID:nTOE69Q041] Analysts at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch wrote in a clientnote that the prevailing market belief was that QE was nowclose to being fully priced in and anything short of $500billion in announced purchases over a six-month horizon coulddisappoint and cause interest rates to rise. A top concern of policymakers in Asia is that anyadditional easing by the Fed will send more speculative "hotmoney" into emerging economies, pushing up their currencies tothe point where exports are less competitive and threateningregional economic growth. Singapore's central bank warned on Wednesday of the risk ofa disorderly reverse of such capital inflows if inflation wasnot contained. Indian and South Korean officials also expressedconcerns about the impact of the recent flood of inflows.[ID:nSGC003812] The Korean won led a selection of emerging Asian currencieslower against the dollar, dipping 0.7 percent to 1,128.95 perdollar by 0630 GMT.
