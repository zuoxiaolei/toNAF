<raw><![CDATA[ * Split IMF doesn't say yuan is "substantially" undervalued * IMF staff sees yuan undervalued by 5-27 percent * Fund sees robust Chinese growth and benign inflation * Recommends higher interest rates and 2011 stimulus exit (Adds details, background, quotes throughout) By Alan Wheatley and Lesley Wroughton BEIJING/WASHINGTON, July 28 (Reuters) - The InternationalMonetary Fund has chosen not to call the yuan "substantially"undervalued, a move that recognises China's efforts to free upits exchange rate and avoids friction with an increasinglyinfluential shareholder. The summary of an annual review of China's policies omittedthe contentious word, used by IMF Managing Director DominiqueStrauss-Kahn as recently as June, which has long riled Beijing. Several members of the IMF's 24-member executive boardbelieved the Chinese currency was too cheap, the fund said. But others said a structural reduction in the balance ofpayments surplus was already unfolding thanks to past steps toboost consumption, while others took issue with an assessmentby IMF staffers that the yuan was substantially undervalued. "This does reflect a softening in the board's positionabout the degree of adjustment that is needed in the Chineseexchange rate regime," said Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow atthe Washington-based Brookings Institution and a former IMFofficial. He said this was reflected in statements to the IMF board,which met on Monday, that China had already made a big movetowards greater currency flexibility and progress inrebalancing demand. Beijing dropped the yuan's 23-month-old peg to the dollarand reverted to a managed float on June 19. China's tradesurplus has also shrunk considerably as government efforts topump up the economy have sucked in imports of commodities andcapital goods. "On both counts this conciliatory tone is a littlepremature, because despite the announcement there hasn't beenthat much movement of the Chinese currency. Any notion thatthey have in fact successfully started rebalancing theireconomy is also quite premature," Prasad said. STAFF SAYS STILL UNDERVALUED The yuan has risen 0.7 percent against the dollar since itwas unshackled from the U.S. currency. Prasad said IMF economists reckoned the yuan was stillbetween 5 percent and 27 percent undervalued depending on themethodologies used. A diplomat in Beijing confirmed the range. "Several Directors agreed that the exchange rate isundervalued. However, a number of others disagreed with thestaff's assessment of the level of the exchange rate, notingthat it is based on uncertain forecasts of the current accountsurplus," the IMF said. Prasad said IMF economists are projecting a big rebound inthe current account surplus, which has fallen to around 4percent of gross domestic product, whereas China is contendingthat it will stay at the new, lower level. People familiar with the board's deliberations saidrepresentatives of the Group of Seven rich nations supportedthe IMF staff's conclusions but did not specifically call theyuan "substantially" undervalued. Reflecting the discussion, the board's concluding statementomitted the disputed phrase. China was so angry with the Fund's exchange rate views thatit withheld cooperation on the annual review from 2007 to 2009. Beijing, though, has gradually been gaining clout in theIMF. Last year it bought $50 billion worth of notes to beef upthe fund's capital and a deputy governor of China's centralbank, Zhu Min, has started work as a special assistant toStrauss-Kahn. RESOURCE SHIFT The IMF's choice of words is the second qualifiedrecognition this month of the progress China is making inliberalising its exchange rate. On July 8, the administration of U.S. President BarackObama said the yuan remained undervalued but declined todesignate China a currency manipulator. That finding angered U.S. lawmakers, many of whom arguethat China is unfairly holding down its currency to favour itsexporters and are threatening punitive action. But a Chinese academic rejected U.S. criticism and said theyuan, also known as the renminbi, was not too cheap. "The U.S. trade deficit with China has nothing to do withthe yuan's exchange rate," He Weiwen, a professor at theUniversity of International Business and Economics, wrote inthe People's Daily on Wednesday. The IMF said the scrapping of the dollar peg would increasethe central bank's flexibility to tighten monetary conditions. A stronger yuan rate would also be good for the rebalancingof the domestic and global economies by shifting China's growthfrom exports and investment to private consumption, it said. On other issues, the board supported a gradual phase-out ofChina's massive fiscal stimulus in 2011, provided the currenttrajectory for the economy -- the IMF expects continued robustgrowth with benign inflation -- is maintained. Directors commended the slower pace of money growth thatChina is targeting this year but urged it to raise interestrates. Unlike many other Asian countries, including India onTuesday, China has not increased borrowing costs in 2010. (Additional reporting by Aileen Wang; Editing by JanDahinten)             ]]></raw>
