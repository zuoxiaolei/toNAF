<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was broadly higher against the other major currencies on Tuesday, as renewed concerns over Spain and the outlook for growth in the euro zone weighed on demand for higher-yielding, riskier assets.During European afternoon trade, the dollar rose to a one-week high against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.69% to 1.2967.Market sentiment was hit as a downgrade of Catalonia and four other Spanish regions by ratings agency Moody’s added to uncertainty over when Madrid may formally request a bailout.Meanwhile, the Bank of Spain said earlier that it expects the country’s economy to contract by 0.4% in the third quarter, bringing the annualized rate of decline to 1.7%, compared to a 1.2% contraction in the three months to June.The central bank also warned that it could not rule out a deficit target overrun this year.The greenback hit a six week high against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.38% to 1.5951.Elsewhere, the greenback slipped lower against the yen, with USD/JPY easing down 0.12% to 79.84, but gained ground against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF advancing 0.67% to 0.9330. The yen found support after Japan’s Finance Minister Koriki Jojima denied a report saying that the government has asked the Bank of Japan to boost its asset-buying program by JPY20 trillion, but he indicated that he would favor further monetary easing by the central bank.The greenback was broadly higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD dipping 0.02% to 0.9920, AUD/USD falling 0.50% to 1.0267 and NZD/USD down .64% to 0.8122.The Bank of Canada left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1.00% earlier and the bank’s rate statement indicated that policymakers could still hike rates in the coming months.Separately, official data showed that retail sales rose 0.3% in August, disappointing expectations for a 0.4% increase, after a 0.7% gain in July.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.52% to 80.08.Also Tuesday, talks between Greek coalition leaders on the EUR13.5 billion in austerity cuts demanded by the Troika continued in Athens ahead of the November 12 deadline for euro zone finance ministers to decide whether Greece should get its next tranche of aid.             ]]></raw>
