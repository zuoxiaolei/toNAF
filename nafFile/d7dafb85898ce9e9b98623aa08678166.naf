<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar index off 8-1/2 month lows * Stronger-than-expected payrolls would help dollar * Dollar/yen below Sept 15 intervention level (Adds quote, updates prices, changes dateline) By Tamawa Desai LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The dollar held steady on Friday,recovering from a sell-off earlier this week as investors bookedprofits and braced for U.S. jobs data and Group of Seven (G7)and IMF meetings later in the day. The dollar remained under pressure as market players expectthe U.S. Federal Reserve to pump more money into the economynext month. Those expectations boosted the euro by 7.5 percentlast month and pushed it to its highest level since January. Market players were wary about a surprise improvement in thejobs data as it would temper expectations of aggressive Fedeasing, and might prompt a squeeze on dollar shorts. "The market is already positioned for a weaker labour marketand more quantitative easing," said Lee Hardman, currencyeconomist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. "We'd have to see a number above 100,000 or 150,000 to makea significant difference," he said. The last reading of U.S. payrolls before the U.S. midtermelections is forecast as unchanged in September, with theunemployment rate seen edging up to 9.7 percent from 9.6 percentin August. Markets were also wary in case the G7 and IMF meetingsstarting on Friday produce a surprise in the form of acoordinated front on currencies, as calls have mounted forglobal efforts to avoid competitive currency devaluations.  This wariness helped to knock the euro off an eight-monthhigh of $1.4030 hit on the EBS platform on Thursday. It was flatfrom late U.S. trade at $1.3934. Options with a strike price of$1.3910 were set to expire later in the day.  DOLLAR INDEX FLAT, YEN FIRM The dollar index, which tracks the performance of thegreenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, wasalso flat at 77.393. It hit an 8-1/2 month low of 76.906 onThursday. It has support at 76.60, which is a low back in mid-Januaryand the index low for 2010. Initial resistance is expected at77.70, the top of Thursday's price action, and then 78.05-10,which was support at the start of October and in January. But the market expects the dollar to remain on the back footuntil the next Fed policy-setting meeting, set for Nov. 2-3. "If non-farm payrolls data improves and the unemploymentrate decreases then the dollar may recover for several days butthat won't change the big picture of low inflation," saidMasafumi Yamamoto, chief Japan FX strategist at Barclays. "Ahead of the FOMC meeting (on Nov. 3) the dollar's recoveryis likely to be very temporary." The Japanese yen held near its 15-year peak against thedollar as traders are starting to feel that Japan may notintervene for now -- at least not as aggressively as it did lastmonth -- to keep the yen's gains in check. The dollar traded at 82.36 yen, less than 30 pips from a15-year low of 82.11 yen hit on Thursday and edging ever closerto its 1995 record low of 79.75 yen. The initial downside target is 81.30 yen, with resistanceexpected at the former supports of 82.87 and 83.15. Optionbarriers are lined up at 82 yen and below. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Japan will takedecisive steps on forex if needed but added it also wants tocooperate with the G7 and other countries. The Australian dollar was steady at $0.9820, after hitting$0.9918 on Thursday, its highest in 28 years.
