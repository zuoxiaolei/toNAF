<raw><![CDATA[ * Market higher ahead of U.S. non-farm payrolls data  * Prospect of ECB rate hikes in focus after hawkish meeting * Oil higher, equities gain   (Adds Wall Street futures) By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - Hopes of an improved U.S.employment picture lifted shares on Friday, but the prospect ofhigher interest rates in Europe and a rising oil price keptother world markets on edge. U.S. stock index futures pointed to a slightly higher openfor Wall Street, adding to hefty gains on Thursday, but this islikely to depend on the U.S. jobless report to be releasedbefore the open. Analysts expecting employers to have hired more workers inFebruary than in any month since May last year. That would feed into the widespread belief that the U.S.economy is in recovery mode and that the improvement should soontrickle down into lagging consumer sentiment. At the same time, however, improved global growth is raisinginflation pressures, particularly threatening at the moment withMiddle East and North African political turmoil driving oilprices to levels that could hurt recovery. Brent crude futures for April delivery were up 64 cents at$115.43 a barrel, off their highs. The prospect of higher inflation prompted the EuropeanCentral Bank on Thursday to indicate it could raise interestrates as soon as next month, a hawkishness that stunned many inthe market. Stock markets were nonetheless relatively buoyant on Friday,lifted by economic optimism even if a number of marketparticipants said it was a tenuous stance. "Any shortfall in the U.S. non-farm payrolls, or anyflare-ups on the geopolitical front could see the risk appetiteebbing away once again," said Chris Weston, institutional traderat IG Markets. World stocks as measured by MSCI were up 0.4 percent, takingthe index up nearly 1.5 percent and not far from a new 30-monthhigh. The FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.4 percent and Japan's Nikkei gained 1 percent.  EURO BOOST The euro hit a four-month high against the dollar, lifted bythe competing push-pull of higher euro zone interest rates and astronger U.S. economy. "We should see better non-farm payrolls figures, but if U.S.yields don't rise, it won't help the dollar," said MarcusHettinger, global FX strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich. "Interest rate differentials ... are playing in favour ofthe euro, so we could see a break above $1.40 any time now." Speculation of an ECB rate rise has expanded the yieldspread between two-year German and U.S. government debt, themost sensitive maturity to official rate moves, to its widestsince January 2009. The euro was flat to slightly higher at $1.3970. The dollarwas flat against a basket of currencies. The euro zone bond market was little changed ahead of thejobs data and following a sell off on Thursday.
