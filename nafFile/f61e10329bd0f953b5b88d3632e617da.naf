<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar/yen rises on short-covering * Sterling edges up after UK house price rise * Aussie dips vs dollar after RBA minutes * German ZEW, US data on retail sales, manufacturing awaited By Satomi Noguchi TOKYO, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the yen onTuesday, pulling away from a seven-month low on short-covering,while investors awaited U.S. data this week that could determinethe near-term direction of the greenback. The Australian dollar dipped after minutes of the ReserveBank of Australia's last policy meeting gave little guidance tomarkets on when the cash rate would be raised from its record lowof 3 percent. But the direction of the U.S. currency was mixed, with thedollar falling against sterling after British house prices rosefor the first time in more than two years, giving a boost to thepound. Market players largely stayed on the sidelines ahead of U.S.retail sales data for August and the New York Federal Reserve's"Empire State" manufacturing figures for September due later inthe session. Traders and analysts said the trend was towards furtherdeclines in the dollar. "Strong trends remain in place for the euro, Australian andand kiwi dollar," National Australia Bank said in a note. "Evendollar/yen has all-round signals to the downside. These signalsonly confirm the overall downside risk in place for the U.S.dollar." A steady drop in Treasury yields in the past few weekssurprised many and triggered speculation that the U.S. dollar wasfast becoming the preferred funding currency for carry trades. But analysts said economic data for August is expected toshow a strong rebound in the economy, and what will matter morefor the market and the dollar's direction may be the economicpicture after the unwinding of stimulus measures. "Data soon to be released is expected to continue showingfirmness in the economy, but such strength may be onlytemporary," said Masaki Fukui, senior market economist for MizuhoCorporate Bank. "What the market will be more concerned about are Septembernumbers for U.S. auto sales or consumer spending to see whetheror not the economy can keep in good shape after the end of thestimulus measures," Fukui said. Germany's ZEW sentiment index for September is due at 0900GMT on Tuesday. Separately, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernankespeaks at 1400 GMT. Comments from two senior Fed officials onMonday indicated that economic recovery might be less thanrobust. The dollar was up 0.2 percent against the yen from late U.S.trading on Monday at 91.12 yen, having risen as high as 91.23 yenearlier, and pulling away from a seven-month low of 90.18 yen hiton trading platform EBS on Monday. Traders said the dollar rose against the yen due toshort-covering, and such dollar buying briefly gained momentumafter the dollar rose above the previous day's intraday high near91.15 yen. The euro was little changed at $1.4621, having pulled backfrom a 2009 high of $1.4654 hit on EBS on Monday. The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against abasket of currencies, was steady at 76.648, staying above aone-year low of 76.457 hit last week. The dollar dipped as low as 1.0322 Swiss francs on EBSearlier in the day, its lowest since late July 2008, then cut itslosses to gain 0.1 percent to 1.0352 francs. Sterling rose 0.3 percent to $1.6639 after news that houseprices in England and Wales had risen for the first time in morethan two years. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said itsseasonally adjusted balance of surveyors reporting a rise inprices in the last three months versus those reporting a fallrose to 10.7 in August, the first positive reading since July2007. The Australian dollar recovered from losses made after theRBA minutes and stood at $0.8619, little changed on the day. JAPAN'S NEW FINANCE MINISTER A Japanese newspaper report saying incoming Japanese leaderYukio Hatoyama has picked veteran lawmaker Hirohisa Fujii asfinance minister had little impact on the yen, partly becauseFujii was already seen as a front runner for the post. Hatoyama will take office as prime minister on Wednesday. Fujii said in an interview with Reuters earlier this monththat Tokyo should not step into currency markets unless exchangerates move abnormally, and that a strong yen is good for Japan asit curbs import costs. Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui BankingCorp, said one point to watch is whether Fujii will stick to sucha stance after he becomes finance minister. "If the yen continues to strengthen there is a good chance itwill eat into exporters' profits. The question is whether it willbe all right for him to just emphasise the merits for imports,"Uno said.
