<raw><![CDATA[ BERLIN, June 8 (Reuters) - Airline industry body IATA lashedout at German plans to impose an air travel tax while Europe'saviation industry is struggling to make a profit amid a weakeconomic environment. "The proposal should be axed. It is the wrong measure at thewrong time," the International Air Transport Association (IATA)said on Tuesday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced the tax plan onMonday, stunning aviation industry executives gathering forIATA's annual meeting in Berlin and planemakers preparing forthe opening of the Berlin Air Show on Tuesday. "The most vulnerable part of the industry is in Europe. Thelast thing the industry here in Europe needs is additional taxesand measures that will slow down economic growth," IATA ChiefEconomist Brian Pearce told reporters. IATA on Monday raised its 2010 earnings estimate for theglobal airline industry and said the only region in whichairlines would continue to post overall losses this year wouldbe Europe. The world's airlines had their worst year ever in 2009, whendemand dropped faster than capacity could be cut as companiesand consumers shrank travel budgets to weather the globaleconomic crisis. The Americas and Asia-Pacific have started to recover, butEurope's airlines have been dogged by airspace closures, labourstrikes and a weakening of the euro. "European airlines are facing a pretty difficult time withweak economies and governments seeking to generate revenues,"Pearce said. German flagship carrier Lufthansa, which said the levyrepresented a "black day" for the airline industry, will likelytake the biggest hit, analysts said. Commerzbank analyst Frank Skodzik said the burden forLufthansa would be about 200 million euros ($268.3 million) ayear, assuming the carrier is able to pass on half of the tax topassengers. Analysts and industry associations estimate the proposed taxcould raise the price of air travel by an average 8-14 euros perticket.
