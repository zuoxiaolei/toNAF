<raw><![CDATA[ * Businesses must lobby governments for trade deal * Doha talks will be dead if not concluded this year By Jonathan Lynn GENEVA, March 2 (Reuters) - Businesses are not working hardenough to get a new world trade agreement even though theso-called Doha deal is in their interest and is attainable,former EU trade chief Leon Brittan said on Wednesday. Brittan, who is trade adviser to British Prime MinisterDavid Cameron, said he was optimistic a Doha deal could be donethis year, as called for by world leaders, but failure to do soin 2011 would mean the trade pact would never be concluded.As European trade commissioner, Brittan played a key role innegotiations on the previous trade agreement, the Uruguay roundcompleted in 1994, and in setting up the World TradeOrganization. Businesses, especially American ones, played a vital part inlobbying governments for the Uruguay deal, but this seemed notto be the case in the talks known as the Doha Development Agenda(DDA), Brittan, a former British cabinet minister, said. "My impression is that the global business community issupportive of the DDA but they're not giving it the prioritythat they could, particularly in the United States," Brittansaid in a speech at the WTO. He said he was personally encouraging U.S. companies such asonline retailer Amazon.com, financial information groupBloomberg and banking group J.P. Morgan to increase pressure onthe U.S. government. He also was talking to multinational corporations active inBritain to persuade them to lobby for a Doha deal at home and inother countries where they operate. U.S. officials have argued in recent years that what is onthe table in the Doha talks is not enough to spur businesses tolobby the U.S. Congress to ratify a deal, and the package needsto contain more business opportunities. Brittan said one reason the talks were attracting lessbusiness interest was that the main obstacles to trade now arenon-tariff barriers such as red tape, which are less visiblethan the high tariffs and duties that were the focus of theUruguay round. But what is on the table would produce the most far-reachingincreases in market access of any global trade negotiation, hesaid. A deal would underpin world economic growth and helpdeveloped and developing countries, he added. He also said agreement is close. "It is safe to say that there is an agreement on about 80 or90 percent of what would constitute the final deal," he said. Although there was no legal reason why the decade-oldnegotiations could not continue beyond this year, it was clearthat negotiators and politicians would not have the stomach tocontinue if they fail to reach a deal in 2011, he said. "Not only I, but everyone I have spoken to in a position ofresponsibility in different main players in the world gets thefeeling that that is the case as far as the Doha round and thisyear is concerned," he said.
