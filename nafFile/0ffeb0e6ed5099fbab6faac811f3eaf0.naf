<raw><![CDATA[ * Russia raises forecasts for oil price, GDP * Higher budget revenues could mean less borrowing * More rate cuts on the cards  By Toni Vorobyova and Dmitry Sergeyev MOSCOW, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Russia's economy could return topre-crisis levels as soon as 2012 thanks to higher thanpreviously expected oil prices, but that does not mean there isscope for more state spending, officials said on Tuesday.Russia has been suffering since the second half of lastyear, when investors fled emerging markets, oil and commodityprices slumped, the rouble was devalued and the global creditcrunch left companies struggling to refinance hefty debts. But this summer has brought early signs the worst ofRussia's first recession in a decade may be over, with officialstouting a return to growth in month-on-month terms. Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said Russia had raised itsforecasts for the average Urals oil price to $57 a barrel thisyear from $54 previously, and expects the price to increasegradually to $60 by 2012 . [ID:nL1553928] A government source told reporters that, as a result, theEconomy Ministry now sees gross domestic product rising 1.6percent in 2010, 3.0 percent in 2011 and 4.3 percent in 2012,compensating for the 8.5 percent GDP fall expected in 2009. "In 2012 we will reach the pre-crisis level of GDP.Previously this was not so," the source said, adding this year'sslowdown could be less deep than officially forecast, perhaps8.2-8.3 percent. [ID:nLV587718] "The external economic sphere has changed significantlythanks to the oil price, metals prices and higher volumes of gasexports and output ... Secondly, (the Economy Ministry) factoredin a slightly more optimistic economic reaction on investmentand on competitiveness in terms of import substitution." The improved forecasts come after Russian Railways trimmedits expectations for the slump in rail freight -- seen as a keybarometer for economic health. [ID:nL0145450]. Data on Tuesday showed Russian banks' assets and capitalrose in July [ID:L1602469], while the manufacturing PMI hit an11-month high in August. [ID:nLAG003694] "The intensity of the decline is clearly easing, which couldsupport further optimism regarding the prospects of quickeconomic recovery and fuel further optimism towards Russianmarkets," said Vladimir Osakovsky, analyst at Unicredit. Even the revised Economy Ministry forecasts are stillgloomier than analysts' consensus in a Reuters poll on Monday,which showed Russian GDP falling just 7.4 percent this year,followed by growth of 3.0 percent in 2010. [ECILT/RU] Standard & Poor's on Tuesday forecast a contraction of 8percent this year and growth of 2 percent in 2010, but said abetter diversification of the economy in the longer-term mayentail a weaker rouble . [ID:nWLA2256]  RATE CUTS EYED Thanks to the brighter outlook on the economy, budget revenues should "change significantly," the source said. "In these conditions, the deficit could turn out to besmaller than is now planned. Some (of the extra cash) will go onextra spending, and some on reducing borrowing." Currently Russia is braced for a 2010 deficit of 7.5 percentof GDP, which will be partly funded by around $18 billion inforeign borrowing. [ID:nLR330292]  For his part, Kudrin said the brighter outlook on oilprices did not mean Russia could further increase governmentspending. "That would involve a growing budget deficit and the use ofreserves, which is comparable to printing money and couldreignite the problem with inflation and rising interest rates,whereas we are now aiming for lower interest rates," he toldreporters at an event to mark the new academic year. "We have not yet come out of the crisis. We are juststarting to come out of it," Kudrin added. [ID:nL1538097] Russia's central bank has cut rates by a total of 225 basispoints since April as it strives to encourage commercial lendersto offer more affordable loans to the recession-struck economy. Analysts polled by Reuters see August consumer prices upjust 0.2 percent, after a 0.6 percent increase in July. Lowerinflation will enable the central bank to cut the refinancingrate to 10.50 percent this month from 10.75 percent. [ECILT/RU] Russia's central bank does not pre-announce the dates of itsrate decisions. First Deputy Chairman Alexei Ulyukayev said lastweek that the next move could come any day.             ]]></raw>
