<raw><![CDATA[ * Exports to drive growth, private consumption weighs * Economy seen growing 1.6 pct in 2010, 1.7 pct in 2011 By Martin Krobs and Sarah Marsh BERLIN, April 14 (Reuters) - Foreign demand will driverecovery in Europe's largest economy this year, outweighing afall in private consumption, a Reuters poll of economists showedon Wednesday. The median estimate made by 16 economists showed grossdomestic product gaining 0.1 percent on a quarterly basis in thefirst three months of the year -- less than previously forecastafter exports, Germany's key growth engine, unexpectedly fell inJanuary and winter weather dampened output. Quarter-on-quarter growth is expected to pick up in thesecond three months to 0.7 percent, easing slightly in the thirdand fourth quarters to 0.4 percent. This should yield an annual increase of 1.6 percent, abovethe government's official forecast for 1.4 percent and theprevious poll's estimate for 1.5 percent. Growth is seenaccelerating in 2011 to 1.7 percent. "It shows Germany reaching pre-crisis levels of growth,which not many countries will manage this year. It is a classicGerman scenario, with foreign demand driving the recoverythrough exports," said Andreas Scheuerle at DekaBank. Germany, the world's biggest exporter of goods from 2003 to2008, emerged from its deepest post-war recession in the secondquarter of last year before stalling in the following threemonths. German exports are expected to grow 7.4 percent in 2010 and5.8 percent in 2011.  CONSUMPTION DRAGS Private consumption, however, will continue to drag onoverall growth, the poll showed, falling on a quarterly basisover the first nine months of the year and posting a 0.6 percentcontraction for the whole year. A key factor weighing on consumption is worries overunemployment in the face of overcapacity in industry. However, annual unemployment is seen rising less thanpreviously expected. Joblessness is forecast to post 8.2 percentin 2010 and rise to 8.6 percent in 2011. In January's poll, itwas seen rising to 9.0 and 9.4 percent respectively. Unemployment fell unexpectedly in March, posting its biggestdrop since June 2008. It has been largely kept in check duringthe global downturn by government subsidies that encourage firmsto shift employees to part-time work rather than fire them. "Like others, we were surprised at how well the labourmarket in Germany held up during the crisis and don't expect tosee a strong collapse in employment now given that orders arepicking up," said Michael Holstein from DZ Bank. The GfK market research group said last month consumermorale would end five months of decline and stabilise in Aprilas households' view of the economy brightened. "Private consumption will nonetheless be weighed down bylower income expectations, with many people working shorterworking weeks, and the special effect of the car scrappagescheme," Holstein said. Last year's 5 billion eurocash-for-clunkers scrapping scheme is now exhausted. (Editing by Ruth Pitchford) (For other stories from the poll click on [ID:nLDE63C0MG])             ]]></raw>
