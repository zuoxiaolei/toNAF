<raw><![CDATA[ * Asian stocks reverse losses, Nikkei ends up 0.1 pct * China retail sales, industrial output up - HK media * Singapore has surprisingly strong Q1 growth By Ian Chua	 SYDNEY, April 14 (Reuters) - Asian stocks reversed losses onThursday after Hong Kong media reported upbeat Chinese economicdata a day ahead of the official release, and surprisinglystrong growth figures from Singapore underscored investorconfidence in the region.	 Gold edged closer to a record high of $1.476.21 asthe U.S. dollar fell to fresh 16-month lows versus a basket ofmajor currencies, while U.S. crude  firmed to $107.45 abarrel, helped by a sharp fall in U.S. gasoline stocks.	 Hong Kong's Phoenix TV, citing an unnamed source, reportedhigher-than-expected increases in Chinese retail sales andindustrial output, but also said inflation in the world's secondbiggest economy had accelerated. [ID:nL3E7FE0EO]	 Singapore impressed after reporting its economy grew 23.5percent in the first quarter on an seasonally-adjustedannualised basis, blowing past even the most bullish forecast ina Reuters poll. 	 Singapore's central bank also allowed an immediate rise inthe value of its currency to help tackle inflation, which itsaid would likely stay elevated.	 The Singapore dollar -- the world's 12th mostactively traded currency -- rose to an all-time high of S$1.2477per U.S. dollar before slipping back slightly.	  The upbeat data helped Asian stocks regain ground withJapan's Nikkei ending 0.1 percent higher, having earlierfallen as much as 0.9 percent. Stocks elsewhere in Asia put on 0.08 percent, keeping in sight athree-year peak set on Monday.	 U.S. stock index futures  traded modestlyhigher, suggesting a positive start for Wall Street.	 Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index was one of the weakestperformers in the region, closing down 0.6 percent, led by a 12percent plunge in contractor Leighton Holdings , whichflagged a big year loss.	 "We've had a fantastic run in the previous three weeks.We're easing back a bit now and that's probably the way we'llglide into Easter," said Austock Securities senior clientadviser, Michael Heffernan.	  U.S. DOLLAR STRUGGLES	 By allowing its currency to rise, Singapore could encourageother Asian central banks to let their currencies appreciatefurther to contain imported inflation.	 "The monetary policy is a little more aggressive than weexpected, so I think it's a realisation that inflation is goingto be a bigger problem in the months ahead," said Wai Ho Leong,economist at Barclays Capital.	 "The recent crisis in Japan is probably adding to inflationpressure, rather than subtracting from growth in the near term."	 Still, last month's devastating earthquake and tsunami inJapan's northeast saw Japanese corporate confidence plunge by arecord amount in April, a Reuters survey showed. 	 The U.S. dollar, already under pressure, slipped further inthe wake of Singapore's action. 	 Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, in remarks published by theofficial Xinhua news agency on Thursday, said China should makeits currency more flexible to help rein in price rises.  	 The dollar index , which tracks its performanceagainst a basket of major currencies, plumbed a fresh 16-monthtrough of 74.642.	 There was little market reaction to U.S. President BarackObama's freshly announced goal of cutting the U.S. budgetdeficit by $4 trillion over 12 years through spending cuts andtax increases on the rich.	 "The move to fiscal discipline is not likely to weighmaterially on growth in 2011," BNP Paribas analysts wrote in aclient note, adding it was unlikely to hit 2012 hard as wellgiven it is an election year.	 "But efforts to address the longer-term fiscal picture would	indeed be encouraging."
