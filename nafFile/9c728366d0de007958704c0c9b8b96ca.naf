<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro hits 5-month high vs dollar, then slips back * Single currency eases from 11-mth high vs Yen * ECB rate hike expectations may be fully priced (Recasts, updates prices; dateline previously LONDON) NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - The euro fell from 11-monthhighs against the yen on Monday and a five-month peak againstthe dollar, with expectations of an increase in euro zoneinterest rates already priced in by investors. The European Central Bank at its policy meeting on Thursdayis expected to raise rates by 25 basis points from a record lowin reaction to rising inflationary pressures in the euro zone,with two more 25 basis point hikes factored in by year-end. Bids from Asian central banks and other investors arelikely to offer solid support to the euro at $1.4190 againstthe dollar, with stops through to below $1.4150 also cited bytraders. Analysts said there were plenty of event risks this week,including a number of central bank rate decisions in thedeveloped world and a slew of speakers from the U.S. FederalReserve, that could see investors adopt a wait-and-see stance. The Bank of Japan is likely to downgrade its economicassessment and keep policy ultra-loose on Wednesday, whilecomments from a senior Federal Reserve official on Fridayhighlighted divergence and uncertainty over the need to tightenmonetary policy in the United States. "It's difficult to sell the euro going into Thursday's ECBmeeting," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst atCommonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. "But there islimited upside and we would need to hear surprisingly hawkishcomment from ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet for asustainable move higher in the euro." The euro  rose but stalled ahead of its November 2010high as resistance around $1.4281 loomed. It was last at$1.4238, up 0.1 percent. Technical analysts also highlighted trendline resistancedrawn from the euro's record high struck in July 2008 coming inaround $1.4300. "The move wider in EUR/USD rate differentials seems to havelost some of its impetus in the run-up to the ECB rate decisionindicating that some euro positives are already priced in bythe market," said Valentin Marinov, analyst at CitiFX in anote. The euro briefly popped above 120 yen  for thefirst time since May 2010 but retreated to 119.55, down 0.1percent from late U.S. trade on Friday. One of the Federal Reserve's most powerful policymakers,William Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank,on Friday went against an increasingly hawkish tone from someother Fed officials worried about inflation, saying he saw noneed for the central bank to reverse course. [ID:nN01154414]  FED POLICY DIVERGENCE Better-than-expected U.S. employment data on Friday,hinting at a stronger recovery and the possibility for higherU.S. rates, gave the greenback some support. Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.1 percent to 83.98 yen. It had hit its highest level since September on Fridayon trading platform EBS, stalling ahead of an option barrier at84.75. Traders reported good interest to sell dollars into the85.00 area. It rose above its 200-day moving average last week, in asign that the downtrend against the yen may have run itscourse. The pair will be sensitive to a host of Fed speakers whoare due to speak later on Monday, including Fed chief BenBernanke. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart and Chicago Fedchief Charles Evans are also scheduled to speak. Last week, hawkish comments from a number of Fedpolicymakers helped the dollar rebound on the yen, before itran out of steam following dovish comments from Dudley. Noting comments from St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard tothe New York Fed's Dudley, Lena Komileva, head of G-10 currencystrategy at Brown Brothers, said, "The policy flow of the pastweek has reflected a growing divergence in the degree ofconfidence surrounding the economy's outlook, which is notunusual for turning points in the Fed's cycle." The yen hovered near recent lows on the crosses,particularly against higher yielding currencies like theAustralian dollar. The Aussie again traded to it highest since being freelyfloated in 1983 . It slipped back to trade at 1.0364,down 0.3 percent on the day. (Reporting by Nick Olivari; Editing by Leslie Adler)             ]]></raw>
