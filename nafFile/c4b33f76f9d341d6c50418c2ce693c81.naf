<raw><![CDATA[ * China says has bought and will buy new Greek bonds * Officials say visit a vote of confidence in Greece * May help deflect criticism of Chinese trade, FX policies * China and Greece urge global economic cooperation  (Adds joint statement paragraphs 5-6) By Ingrid Melander and Harry Papachristou ATHENS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - China offered on Saturday to buyGreek government bonds when Athens resumes issuing, in a show ofsupport for the country whose debt burden pushed the euro zoneinto crisis and required an international bailout. Premier Wen Jiabao made the offer at the start of a two-dayvisit to Greece, his first stop on a tour of Europe, and alsosaid he wanted to boost shipping and trade ties with Athens,underscoring Beijing's use of economic strength to win friends. "With its foreign exchange reserve, China has already boughtand is holding Greek bonds and will keep a positive stance inparticipating and buying bonds that Greece will issue," Wensaid, speaking through an interpreter.  "China will undertake a great effort to support euro zonecountries and Greece to overcome the crisis." Wen and his Greek counterpart George Papandreou said in astatement the world's nations need to coordinate their economicpolicies for global recovery to find a sure footing. "The global economy shows signs of gradual recovery but manyuncertainties remain," the two leaders said in the statement,issued on Saturday by Papandreou's office after the two men metin Athens. In addition to seeing economic opportunities in Greece,China may calculate its support of a struggling European countrywill help deflect international criticism of its trade policiesand its refusal to let its yuan currency appreciate sharply. Wen did not specify how much Greek debt China would bewilling to buy or which Chinese entities would buy the bonds. Chinese state entities have been generally conservativeabout investing in foreign financial markets and the Chinesegovernment faces domestic political criticism over lossesincurred by these entities during the global financial crisis.  HIGH BORROWING COSTS A senior Greek government official said Wen made clear hisoffer concerned buying bonds only when the country returned tomarkets. Greece, which is currently funded through a 110 billion euro($150 billion) EU/IMF bailout, is only issuing short-termT-bills for the time being. Since the true scale of its debt burden emerged late lastyear, investors have shunned its bonds. The yield they demand tohold 10-year Greek debt has shot up to 10 percent, compared withjust 2.3 percent for similar bonds from the euro zone's biggesteconomy Germany, making it too expensive for Greece to seeklong-term funding in international markets. It has said it wants to return to markets some time nextyear to sell longer-term debt. China, at loggerheads with the United States over the yuanand likely to face similar complaints during this European tour,emphasised its willingness to cooperate with the 27-nation EU onfinancial issues. "China is prepared, hand in hand with the EU, as passengersin the same boat, to strengthen cooperation ... to confront thefinancial crisis," Wen said. "I believe that we can undertake agenuine effort to promote the reform of the internationalfinancial system and strengthen its supervision," he said. Neither Wen nor Greek Prime Minister George Papandreoumentioned the Chinese currency at the news conference.  SHIPPING FUND, TRADE, EXPORTS Wen said China wanted to boost cooperation with Greece --which faces its worst recession in decades as it struggles withits debt -- on all fronts, including by setting up a shippingfund and doubling bilateral trade to $8 billion by 2015. "China will set up a special Greek-Chinese shippingdevelopment fund for Greek shipowners on which it will invest,in an initial phase, $5 billion," Wen told the news conference."The aim is to offer Greek shipowners a basket of financialsupport to buy Chinese-made vessels." Greece and China pledged to stimulate investment in amemorandum of understanding and private companies signed a dozendeals in areas like shipping, construction and tourism. With the global economic crisis and competition with otherBalkan countries increasing, foreign direct investment in Greecefell from 6.9 billion euros in 2006 to 4.5 billion in 2009,according to Investment Ministry figures. Chinese investment represents a very minor proportion ofthis, excluding a 35-year concession deal China's Cosco signedin 2008 to turn the port of Piraeus into a regional hub for aguaranteed amount of 3.4 billion euros, according to portauthority figures. The investment memorandum does not target specificinvestment volumes, an official close to Investment MinisterHarris Pamboukis said ahead of Wen's visit. "We want to build this strategic partnership with China,"the investment ministry official said. "The purpose is not asignature on something big." Wen will address the Greek parliament on Sunday and leaveearly on Monday for Brussels, where he will attend an EU-Chinasummit before going on to Germany, Italy and Turkey. Clinching business deals with countries such as China andQatar would help boost confidence among Greek consumers andbusinesses, economic analysts said.
