<raw><![CDATA[ * Tough choices ahead for UK military, document says * Call for greater European cooperation  (Adds new Ainsworth quote, Conservative comment) By Adrian Croft LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Britain said on Wednesday itsarmed forces faced tough choices to adapt to an age of austeritybut said greater defence cooperation, including with otherEuropean nations, could help make stretched budgets go further. A government discussion paper on the future of the militaryacknowledged Britain could not afford to pursue all of itscurrent defence activities while supporting operations inAfghanistan and elsewhere and investing in new systems. "We will need to do things differently in the future andprioritise some activities over others. Hard choices andimportant decisions lie ahead," Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworthwrote in the paper. Britain, a staunch ally of the United States, has one ofEurope's strongest armed forces but it has been stretched by thewars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where it still has 9,500 troops. The government's need to rein in a deficit forecast to reach178 billion pounds ($285 billion) this year has raised questionsover whether it can afford all the multi-billion-dollarequipment programmes it has signed up to, ranging from areplacement for its nuclear-armed submarine fleet to two newaircraft carriers to the Joint Strike Fighter. The Afghan and Iraq conflicts have highlighted failings inequipment such as a lack of helicopters and armoured vehicles. The paper, intended to form the basis for a review ofdefence strategy, made no recommendations on equipment. But Ainsworth said the Labour government stood by itsdecision to replace the nuclear submarines, expected to cost 20billion pounds, and was committed to the new aircraft carriers.  CONSERVATIVES MAY TAKE DECISIONS Critical decisions on the future of the British armed forcesmay fall to the opposition Conservatives, favourites to win anelection expected in May. They too have promised to conduct astrategic defence review, if elected. Ainsworth told parliament "not a penny will be cut" fromnext year's defence budget but that, in future, it faced "realfinancial pressure". One way to make best use of the availableresources was greater international cooperation, he said. NATO remained the cornerstone of Britain's security, thepaper said, stressing the importance of its U.S. ties. "However, as Europeans, we must take greater responsibilityfor our security together. Stronger European defence cooperationoffers many opportunities, not least in the wider role defenceshould play in resolving conflict and building peace," it said. France's return to NATO's integrated command structure lastyear offered an opportunity for greater cooperation, it said. Conservative defence spokesman Liam Fox agreed France andthe United States were likely to be Britain's main strategicpartners, but he voiced doubts about other European allies. "For us there are two tests: Do they invest in defence? Anddo they fight? Too few European allies pass both these tests,"he said. Bastian Giegerich, research fellow for European security atthe International Institute for Strategic Studies thinktank,said defence cooperation had been forced on to the agenda by "thecontinuing high demand on forces, the consistent capability gapand the budget crunch." Current EU defence cooperation includes a naval force set upto combat piracy off Somalia. Britain has in the past beensuspicious about duplicating NATO functions within the EU forfear it would undermine the transatlantic alliance.             ]]></raw>
