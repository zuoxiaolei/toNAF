<raw><![CDATA[ * Central bank sees Q4 growth of 0.5 percent * Investment survey sees 2010 slip, 2011 upturn  By Leigh Thomas PARIS, Nov 9 (Reuters) - France will escape a sharp slowdownin growth in the second half of the year with the second biggesteuro zone economy projected to expand 0.5 percent in the finalquarter of 2010, according to Bank of France data on Tuesday. The 1.9 trillion euro economy is picking up momentum thanksto improving activity in industry and the service sector aftergrowth moderated in the third quarter to an estimate of 0.3percent by the central bank. "This basically is consistent with the idea that what we'llhave in the second half of 2010 is a super-soft landing, ratherthan anything really nasty, which is good news," said DeutscheBank economist Gilles Moec. "But for 2011 I remain quite prudent because we haven't yetseen the impact of the fiscal consolidation and I don't thinkwe've seen all the impact of the reappreciation of the currencysince June," he added. According to a Reuters poll, economists expect official datadue on Friday to show that the French economy grew 0.4 percentin the third quarter after expanding 0.7 percent in the secondquarter. Economists forecast that the economy is set to grow 1.5percent this year after a 2.2 percent contraction in 2009, ayear of recession across the industrialised world. The French central bank said its monthly industry sentimentindex rose to 103 in October from 102 in September, while theindicator for France's dominant service sector remained stableat 96. For the months ahead, the central bank said it expectedactivity to continue to grow in the services sector, whileindustrial output was also set to improve. The data follow figures last month that showed businessconfidence topping its long-term average in October(ID:PISKLE6AT) and consumer morale rising three times fasterthan expected in September (ID:LDE69P0CC). However, the most recent surveys of purchasing managerssuggested that France's factory upturn moderated in October(ID:SLA1ME6GZ) while widespread strikes over pension reformweighed on the dominant services sector (ID:SLA3ME6HJ).  INVESTMENT SURVEY TEMPERS OUTLOOK A survey of industrial investment, often a volatile gauge,added a less promising note to the stream of data. The rate of investment was seen falling two percent in 2010,revised down from an increase of five percent in the last pollin July, the INSEE national statistics office said. But investment was seen rebounding next year by ninepercent. BNP Paribas economist Dominique Barbet said the downwardrevision was not alarming insofar as a strong recovery wasforeseen in 2011. "But it does show a high level of hesitation and worry amongcompanies," he added. Separately, France's trade deficit narrowed less thanexpected in September to 4.683 billion euros versus the previousmonth, according to the customs office. An increase in the number of Airbus shipments, the sale oftwo satellites and strong demand for French wheat in Africahelped reduce the deficit.(Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Additional reporting by VickyBuffery, Editing by Brian Love and Stephen Nisbet)             ]]></raw>
