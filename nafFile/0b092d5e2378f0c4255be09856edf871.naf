<raw><![CDATA[ By Lucy Hornby BEIJING, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The hijacking of a Chinese shipcarrying coal across the Indian Ocean shows that Somalianpirates are expanding their reach beyond the Gulf of Aden,Chinese shippers said. The De Xin Hai, carrying about 76,000 tonnes of coal fromSouth Africa to the port of Mundra, in Gujarat, India, washijacked about 700 nautical miles off the east coast of Somaliaon Monday, the European Union's counter-piracy force said. The ship could be brought to Haradheere, a piratestronghold, or Hobyo, both in the central portion of Somalia'sIndian Ocean coastline, pirates told Reuters. "This shows that the pirates are expanding theiroperations," said an official at the China Shipowners'Association in Beijing. It was the first reported attack on aChinese merchant ship in the Indian Ocean, he said. "The Indian Ocean is very big, and too hard to defend. TheGulf of Aden is a more limited area." China with great fanfare sent three warships to Somalianwaters late last year, after a ship carrying oil to China wasattacked by pirates. But Chinese warships, like those of othernations, primarily provide protection in the narrow anddangerous Gulf of Aden, not in the much larger Indian Ocean. Chinese ships travelling through the Gulf of Aden formconvoys that are escorted by warships from Djibouti to themouth of the Gulf, according to the association's website.Convoys sail about every five days in each direction. The De Xin Hai was travelling alone up the east coast ofAfrica when she was hijacked, with about 25 Chinese crewmenonboard. Shipowner Qingdao Ocean Shipping, a unit of ChinaOcean Shipping or COSCO, requested help on Monday afternoon. Ships travelling up the east coast of Africa are advised tostay at least 600 nautical miles offshore, Chinese shipperssaid. The De Xin Hai was beyond that range. "Somalia is a real headache for everyone. If you stay toofar from the coast, you lose time and it costs too much extramoney," said a Hong Kong shipbroker. "Every captain has to decide how offshore to stay based onhis own experience." Some French and Spanish fishing fleets north of theSeychelles have also been attacked in recent weeks, as thepirates range into the Indian Ocean. The De Xin Hai was about350 nautical miles north of the Seychelles. Ship captains generally begin evasive action when they spotpirates approaching, the broker said, adding that the muchsmaller pirate flotillas are "not easy to see, especially atnight." Warships can only help if they are less than 45 minutesaway, he added. (Editing by Bill Tarrant)             ]]></raw>
