<raw><![CDATA[ * Greece aid hopes may have put floor under markets for now * Risk taking in general has not recovered * Honda shares down after big recall, joining Toyota * Sceptics on Greece, Europe still look to buy US dollars By Kevin Plumberg HONG KONG, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose onWednesday on signs that the European Union may rescuedebt-strapped Greece, coaxing nervous investors back to riskierassets, but uncertainty over the plan weighed on the euro. Major European shares were expected to open higher for athird day, on hopes for Greece, though U.S. stock futures weremarginally lower. Deteriorating confidence in the ability of Greece, Portugaland Spain to finance growing fiscal shortfalls has spookedfinancial markets for weeks and knocked the euro to its lowestsince May 2009, just below $1.36. European governments have agreed in principle to helpGreece, German coalition sources told Reuters on Tuesday.However, a German government spokesman dampened hopes by sayinga decision had not yet been reached. But caution prevailed. Even if the EU pulls Greece from thefire, it was not clear if the rescue would prevent investorsfrom concentrating on the next weak link in the euro zone, orif growing debt problems in Europe in general would start toimpede a global economic recovery. "Certainly there are reports about support for Greece, butnothing concrete has been decided. So while downward pressurehas definitely decreased, there's still no real reason to buy,"said Hideyuki Ishiguro, a strategist at Okasan Securities inTokyo. Following gains of more than 1 percent on Wall Street,Japan's Nikkei share average ended up 0.3 percent. Earlier gains were cut after Honda Motor Co expanded arecall of cars globally to replace an airbag part, hard on theheels of a rapidly expanding and increasingly embarrassingrecall by Toyota Motor Co over numerous safety issues. Toyota's huge recall may not be the end of the nightmarishstart of the year for the world's biggest car maker. U.S.regulators said overnight they are reviewing complaints ofsteering problems in newer Toyota Corolla models. Shares of Toyota, which have lost about a fifth of theirvalue since late January, edged up 0.4 percent, while Hondafell 1.6 percent. The MSCI index of Asian stocks traded outside Japan was up0.6 percent, with the materials sector leading the way aftergains in metal and commodities prices overnight. China posted solid import and export figures for January,keeping its growth trajectory stable while only mildly addingto pressure to allow the yuan to appreciate. The numbers supported continued allocation by foreigninvestors to Asian assets. "Overall growth rates across the Asian region continue tomove higher and we have no reason to disagree as the medium tolong-term growth drivers in this region have much morepotential than in the debt-burdened West," said Sarah Arkle,chief investment officer for Threadneedle in London, in a note. EURO FALTERS DESPITE GREECE NEWS In the currency market, the euro fell 0.4 percent to$1.3746 after soaring to a high around $1.3840 overnight onhopes the EU will hammer out a package soon for Greece. The longer it takes for confirmation of a bailout, however,the more sceptics of a quick solution to Europe's fiscalproblems will look to buy dollars against developed currencies. Against the yen, the euro was down 0.2 percent to 123.32yen U.S. oil futures were down 0.3 percent to $73.50 a barrelafter an industry group said U.S. crude stockpiles rose morethan forecast last week.
