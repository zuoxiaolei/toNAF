<raw><![CDATA[ * Asian stocks near 5-mth lows as investors sell riskyassets * Euro zone woes, US jobless rates may slow global recovery * Dollar rises given fears over sovereign debt in Europe * Ailing euro rebounds on Swiss intervention - traders By Dean Yates SINGAPORE, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell tofive-month lows on Friday as investors dumped riskier assetsafter growing sovereign debt problems in the euro zone andrising U.S. jobless claims sparked jitters about the globaleconomic recovery. European stocks  were expected to extend theprevious session's sharp losses on worries about high debtlevels in Greece and Portugal, which have fueled marketnervousness ahead of U.S. January non-farm payrolls data due at1330 GMT. U.S. stock futures , however, pointed to a slightlyhigher open after Wall Street dived 3 percent on Thursday,suffering its worst losses in more than nine months. Underscoring how euro zone troubles are increasinglyspilling over into global markets, sources said the SwissNational Bank intervened on Friday to weaken its own currency,which has appreciated rapidly as the euro tumbled, threateningthe country's recovery. Stock markets and commodity prices have recoiled this weekon fears that growing troubles in Europe could impede or evenderail an economic recovery that helped equities surge in 2009. An unexpected increase in U.S. unemployment claimsheightened those concerns ahead of the non-farm payroll data[ECONUS] on Friday, a number that will be closely watched bymarkets given its implications for consumer demand in theworld's biggest economy. [ID:nN04115255] "I think it's a confidence issue right now. We definitelydo need to see unemployment in the U.S. start to decline beforeconsumption can really start to pick up," said Lorraine Tan,director of Asia equity research at S&P in Singapore. The payroll data is forecast to show a net 5,000 U.S. jobswere created last month, but the rate of unemployment is seencreeping up to 10.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei average  dropped nearly 3 percent toits lowest close in two months, with exporters hurt by astronger yen as well as the escalating problems in Europe. Theyen, like the dollar, has firmed as investors move into assetstraditionally seen as safe havens in times of market turmoil. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index  was down3 percent and on track to close below its 200-day movingaverage -- often used as an indicator of longer-term trends --for the first time since April 30, 2009. Taiwan  stocks closed below their 200-day movingaverage for the first time since last April, shedding 4.3percent in their biggest daily percentage fall in nearly 13months. Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief investment strategist at SJSMarkets in Hong Kong, said worse may lay ahead for Asian stocksin the second quarter. He said the waning impact of fiscal stimulus measures in bigeconomies would trigger a double-dip recession in the UnitedStates, Europe and Japan by the end of the year, and thatmarkets would see it coming. "When it comes to equities, markets usually anticipatechanges in the direction of the global economy about twoquarters before they occur," Kowalczyk said. "Obviously when you look at what's happening with themarket this year, some might say the correction has alreadybegun. But I think this correction, while it is painful, is notthe major one that will come ahead of the double dip." Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan as measured by MSCI fell 3.3 percent to levels last seen in earlySeptember. Declines were led by resource and tech stocks, whichfell 4 percent on fears that global demand was faltering. Asian stocks outside Japan have fallen nearly 10 percentthis year after rising 68 percent in 2009 on the back ofgovernment measures worldwide that stimulated spending anddragged the global economy back from the abyss. EURO IN FOCUS AFTER SWISS INTERVENTION The U.S. dollar  extended gains from the previoussession as investor anxiety about sovereign debt in Greece,Portugal and Spain triggered a sell-off in the euro andgrowth-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar. The dollar firmed 0.2 percent against a basket of othermajor currencies . Overnight, the euro hit its lowest level in more than eightmonths against the dollar and plunged to a 15-month low againstthe Swiss franc . But the common currency rebounded slightly in Asian tradeafter the Swiss central bank sold Swiss francs and bought eurosto weaken its own currency, three people who saw the actionsaid. The central bank would not comment. The euro jumped to the day's high of 1.4905 francs on EBS after falling as far as 1.4551 francs, itslowest since October 2008, and later held around 1.4730 francs,up 0.6 percent on the day. The Swiss National Bank has pledged to stem a sharp-run upin the france against the euro because its fears a strongerfranc will erode the country's export competitiveness andthreaten its broader recovery. The weakness in the euro was partly attributed to wideningGreek, Portuguese and Spanish bonds' yield spreads over Germanbenchmarks. [GVD/EUR]. Crude oil futures  rose 35 cents or half a percent to$73.49 a barrel, after suffering its biggest one-day fall sinceJuly on signs that U.S. energy demand is falling despite anapparent rebound in manufacturing.
