<raw><![CDATA[ By Alister Bull WASHINGTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obamais considering a number of options to try to jump-start jobcreation, the top priority for recession-weary Americans as thecountry heads toward congressional elections in November. Obama unveiled one new initiative on Monday -- a six-yearplan to overhaul the United States' aging highways, railwaysand airport runways with an initial investment of $50 billionin the first year. He is expected to announce more initiatives on Wednesday,including extending a tax credit for companies for research anddevelopment. But is it all too little too late? The Obama administration's caution reflects the hardpolitical truth that there are not enough votes in the U.S.Congress to deliver another government spending bill to rivalthe $814 billion stimulus package he signed in 2009. The White House is adamant it will not propose a secondgiant effort. In an election campaign in which oppositionRepublicans are playing on voters' anxiety about record U.S.spending, "stimulus" has become a dirty word. Republicans have castigated Obama for what they callreckless spending, sapping support for more action amongDemocrats in tight election races in November. But deepening voter discontent over the stubbornly high 9.6percent unemployment rate, means Obama has to do something tostimulate job growth, even though analysts agree he has fewoptions and that there is little he can do before November'selections. Here are some questions and answers about what is alreadyon the table and what Obama is reported to be considering. WHAT IS OBAMA PROPOSING? -- Obama will ask Congress on Wednesday to increase andpermanently extend a tax credit for business research as a wayof boosting job growth, administration officials say. Theproposal would cost $100 billion over 10 years. A one-year extension had already been written intolegislation before Congress, and investors had assumed it wouldbe made permanent. -- Obama announced on Monday a plan to rebuild 150,000miles (240,000 km) of roads; construct and maintain 4,000 miles(6,400 km) of rail; and rehabilitate or reconstruct 150 miles(240 km) of runway and modernize the air traffic controlsystem. The plan, dismissed by Republicans as a "last-minute,cobbled-together stimulus bill," could be funded in part byrolling back tax breaks for oil and gas companies, theadministration says. It will not have an immediate stimulativeeffect on hiring as it is not expected to generate new jobsuntil 2011. The Obama administration has no firm figure for thenumber of new jobs but says it will be "substantial." WHAT ELSE IS HE CONSIDERING? Obama will talk about several initiatives to stimulate theeconomy in a speech on Wednesday, but it is not clear whetherhe will offer new ideas or simply repeat Monday's announcementwhile formally unveiling the business research tax proposal. Here are some other ideas he is considering. -- Tax cuts to encourage hiring in the United States. Thiscould include relief for employers to encourage hiring. It'sthe kind of measure that might get Republican support inCongress, but not before the elections. The White House is reported to be considering using revenuefrom expiring tax cuts for the wealthy to finance about $35billion of tax cuts for small businesses and workers. -- Extending former President George W. Bush's tax cuts forfamilies earning less than $250,000 a year. Experts from thecongressional Joint Committee on Taxation say this would cost$1.3 trillion over a decade, and add a further $700 billion ifthe tax cuts for richer Americans are also extended, asRepublicans want. WHAT IS ALREADY OUT THERE? -- Getting Congress to agree to renewing Obama's MakingWork Pay tax credit of $800 for a married couple or $400 forindividuals. Available for taxpayers who make less than $75,000a year, it will expire at the end of 2010 unless Congress votesto extend it. -- Getting Congress to agree to extend long-termunemployment insurance again. This expires at the end ofNovember unless Congress backs another extension. -- More bonus depreciation to encourage businesses toinvestment in capital equipment, which the revenue serviceallows them to write off at a faster pace, helping smallbusiness cash flow without producing a hefty price-tag for thedeficit because the costs are pushed out into the future. HOW MUCH HELP IS NEEDED? -- Top Obama adviser Christina Romer, in her final speechas chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers,on Wednesday urged policymakers to find the will to act tospare the country the damage of high unemployment. Growth slowed in the second quarter to 1.6 percent andother recent data has been mixed, keeping concerns alive thatthe economy could be heading toward a double-dip recession.(Writing by Alister Bull and Ross Colvin; additionalreporting by Kim Dixon; Editing by Eric Beech)             ]]></raw>
