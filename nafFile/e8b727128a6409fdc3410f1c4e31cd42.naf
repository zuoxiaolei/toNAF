<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar dropped against the yen on Wednesday after investors sold the greenback for profits.In U.S. trading on Wednesday, USD/JPY was trading at 101.18, down 1.13%, up from a session low of 100.72 and off a high of 102.53.The pair was likely to find resistance at 103.73, Wednesday's high, and support at 100.72, the earlier low.Better-than-expected consumer confidence and housing data out of the U.S. sent the dollar surging on Tuesday amid sentiments that the Federal Reserve may be closer to winding down stimulus measures, including its monthly USD85 billion bond-buying program, which weaken the greenback to spur recovery.Profit taking kicked in by Wednesday, which gave investors room to take up nicely priced positions in the yen, especially amid hawkish statements stemming from the Bank of Japan.In Japan earlier, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said a stable financial system is just as important to the country as growth-oriented monetary policies, which investors interpreted as a sign that Tokyo may hold off on loosening policy for a while.The Bank of Japan in recent months has rolled out massive monetary stimulus measures to steer the economy away from deflationary decline, which has weakened the yen.The yen, meanwhile, was up against the pound and up against the euro, with GBP/JPY down 0.63% and trading at 152.94 and EUR/JPY trading down 0.59% at 130.80.             ]]></raw>
