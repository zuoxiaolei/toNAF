<raw><![CDATA[ * Swiss franc climbs to record high versus euro and dollar * Dollar burdened by pullback in U.S. yields * Moves comes in thin year-end trade (Updates prices, adds details) By Neal Armstrong LONDON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc hit record highsversus the euro and the dollar on Thursday, bolstered by itssafe-haven status and lower U.S. bond yields in thin year-endtrade that exaggerated price swings. The dollar weakened broadly, hitting a seven-week lowagainst the yen and a 28-year low against the Australian dollaras traders took the falls in U.S. bond yields as a cue to sell. U.S. Treasury prices recovered on Wednesday, pushing yieldssharply lower, after a $29 billion auction of seven-year notesdrew surprisingly strong demand. [ID:nN29284358].  The euro continues to smart from concerns over debtfinancing in the currency bloc's peripheral countries, givinginvestors cause to seek the relative safety of the Swisscurrency. "The franc is a hedging vehicle for euro zone risk and weneed some degree of resolution to concerns about credit risk inthe euro zone periphery to stop it grinding higher," said RayFarris, currency strategist at Credit Suisse. "The dollar is a weak currency and it will continue toweaken against those currencies that aren't actively trying todisqualify themselves from being an alternative to the dollar,which right now includes the Swiss," he said. The euro fell as low as 1.2398 francs  after aSwiss bank targeted an option barrier at 1.2400, before bouncingback to trade at 1.2434, down 0.6 percent on the day. The dollar fell to 0.9371 francs  as the euro/Swissbarrier gave way. It was last at 0.9381, sitting with losses of0.8 percent on the day. Swiss implied volatilities ticked higherwith the one-month dollar/Swiss franc  trading around11.80 percent, a level last seen in the middle of November. The moves came in a thin market with many players sidelineduntil the new year. "FX trading activity remains highly subdued in theprevailing holiday market, and this cautions against reading toomuch into the price action," said UBS analysts in a note toclients. The euro climbed to $1.3260  after refusing to breakbelow its 200-day moving average, now at $1.3086, frustratingbearish investors who think Portugal and possibly Spain could bethe next to be bailed out in the new year. Italy placed most of its planned issue of bonds at a tenderon Thursday, although it cut the final sales of two papers andwas forced to accept broadly higher yields. [ID:nMAT012394]  DOLLAR/YEN NEAR 7-WEEK LOW The dollar slipped as low as 81.28 yen  in Asia, itslowest in seven weeks and edging closer to a 15-year low of80.21 yen hit in November. It later recovered to 81.42, stilldown 0.3 percent on the day. Traders now await weekly U.S. jobless claims report, ChicagoPMI numbers and pending home sales for November later in thesession. Any signs of further deterioration in the U.S. housingsector, where foreclosures jumped in the third quarter, couldsee the dollar come under more pressure. Traders said a rise in the Chinese yuan after China'sinterest rate hike last Saturday was supporting Asiancurrencies, including the yen. The yuan  hit a record high against the dollar onThursday after the Chinese central bank set the yuan mid-point versus the dollar at a record high. Chinese PresidentHu Jintao visits the United States on Jan. 19 for a summit inwhich the subject of the undervalued yuan is likely to loomlarge. [ID:nTOE6BM01F] The Australian dollar hit a fresh 28-year high of $1.0198 against the U.S. dollar, though option barriers at$1.0200 prevented further gains as it eased back to $1.0169.(Additional reporting by Anirban Nag; Editing by PatrickGraham, John Stonestreet)             ]]></raw>
