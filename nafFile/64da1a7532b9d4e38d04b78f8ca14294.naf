<raw><![CDATA[ SHANGHAI, June 1 (Reuters) - China would benefit fromallowing its currency to be traded more freely, Canadian TradeMinister Peter Van Loan said on Tuesday. "It is always better for a currency to float freely in themarketplace. For China, there will be tremendous benefits for thecurrency to float freely," Van Loan told reporters in Shanghai. Van Loan said a more flexible currency would help China'scase in asking to be treated as a market economy by its tradepartners. China is under pressure from trade partners to unshackle theyuan  from a de facto dollar peg in place sincemid-2008, which they say gives it an unfair advantage in globaltrade.
