<raw><![CDATA[ SEOUL, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Leaders of the G20 instructed theirfinance ministers on Friday to draw up indicative guidelines tospot large current account imbalances that threaten todestabilise the global economy. The guidelines, which will be composed of a range ofindicators, will help with the timely identification ofimbalances that "require preventive and corrective actions to betaken", according to a communique issued after a two-day summitof the Group of 20 major economies. Ministers will work with the International Monetary Fund ondeveloping the guidelines, with progress to be discussed in thefirst half of next year. A draft version of the communique had shown the G20 wasundecided whether to describe the guidelines as "measurable" oras "quantitative and qualitative". In the end, no description was used. The G20 declared global recovery to be continuing but withdownside risks and said tensions and vulnerabilities in theinternational monetary system were clearly apparent. Adopting the language agreed by finance ministers when theymet in Gyeongju, South Korea, last month, the leaders pledged tomove towards market-determined exchange rate systems and toenhance currency flexibility to reflect economic fundamentals. Advanced economies will guard against disorderly exchangerate movements, which will help mitigate the risk of excessivevolatility in capital flows facing some emerging economies, thecommunique said. In that context, the G20 said those emerging economies withincreasingly overvalued exchange rates that face an undue burdenof adjustment would be justified in taking "carefully designedmacro-prudential measures" to counter capital inflows.
