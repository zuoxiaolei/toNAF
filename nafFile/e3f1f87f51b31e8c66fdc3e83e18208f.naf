<raw><![CDATA[ TOKYO, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister HirohisaFujii said on Tuesday he would not rule out taking action in theforeign exchange markets if currency moves are abnormal. Fujii also reiterated his view that global competition todevalue each country's currency would be wrong but that he hadnever said he would leave a strong yen as it is. He was speaking at a news conference after a cabinet meeting. The yen's surge to an eight-month high against the greenbackon Monday has prompted the finance minister to backtrack onearlier comments that he wanted to avoid currency interventionand that a strong yen was good for Japan's domestic demand. Japan's currency hit 88.22 against the dollar on Monday,according to Reuters data, the highest level since January. (Reporting by Leika Kihara, Stanley White)             ]]></raw>
