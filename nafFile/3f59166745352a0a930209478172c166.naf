<raw><![CDATA[ By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Central European currencies areseen posting minor gains against the euro in the next months,while the Polish zloty is seen surging about 8 percent over 12months, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Tuesday. According to the poll of 46 analysts, conducted on Oct 1-6,forecasts for the region's main currencies in the next 12 monthsshowed slightly stronger levels than one month ago, despite somemarket jitters in the past weeks. The Czech crown, the Polish zloty andHungary's forint have firmed 16-19 percent to the eurosince hitting lows early this year on concerns over the region'sfinancial stability amid the global crisis. Exchange rates are coming into focus again as investorsassess risks to the global recovery and domestic uncertaintiesin the high-yielding Central European region over its growthoutlook, budgets and politics. International Monetary Fund Director Marek Belka has warnedthat investors increasingly differentiate between assets in theregion and governments need further measures to guarantee fiscaldiscipline or the recovery will pass them by.[ID:nL522524] ZLOTY REMAINS FAVOURITE The zloty was seen by analysts in the poll as the clearwinner in the differentiation game. They saw it retreating to4.2 per euro by end-October from around 4.18 on Tuesday, butsurging to 3.9 in 12 months, a forecast unchanged from lastmonth. "It's more difficult to forecast for the short- and themedium-term as the zloty has been quite volatile and there aresignificant uncertainties in the short term like the statebudget," said Zsolt Papp of KBC in London. "But growth prospectsin Poland are more stable than elsewhere in the region." While Poland is the only country in the region which hasavoided deep recession, the zloty is also buoyed by theexpectation that its central bank is unlikely to cut rates. Hungary's bank (NBH) is seen continuing to slash rates toaround 5.75 percent by next year from 7.5 percent now, while the Czech central bank said the crown had firmed too much and itmight further cut its 1.25 percent main rate.[ID:nL58899] Analysts expect the crown to firm slightly to 25.5 fromTuesday's 25.58 by the end of this month, to 25.25 in six monthsand 25 in 12 months. Those forecasts are a shade firmer than one month ago. The12-month forecast for the Hungarian forint improved, however,to 266 per euro from 272 a month ago. Before strengthening, the currency is expected to retreat to273.15 in the next six months, when the NBH is seen cuttinginterest rates, from Tuesday's levels around 267. "Hungary has had a massive foreign trade surplus which helpsstabilize the exchange rate," said Orsolya Nyeste of Erste Bank."This is the key factor, I don't think that elections nextspring could have a big impact on the forint." The leu, the most stable currency in the regionthis year, is expected to trade close to current levels at 4.26in the next three months, but to firm to 4.1 by September 2010,after Romania leaves behind its current political turmoil.  RISKS REMAIN While the Czech central bank is worried a strong crown candeepen recession, a 19.9 percent fall in Hungary's industrialoutput in August was also a reminder of the risks that domesticeconomic trends can pose to the currency. [ID:nL6653725] The median forecasts in the poll show little exchange ratemovement in the region in the next months, and many analystsbelieve an improvement in risk appetite in the world in the pastmonths could continue to lend support to the currencies. The individual forecasts stayed in wide ranges as someinvestors still expect a deterioration in global marketsentiment, some for the end of this year, others for next year. Danske Bank last month introduced "scorecards" for theregion's currencies in its reports to help investors find theirway among a multitude of economic, carry, technical and otherdomestic factors to differentiate between the region's assets. "Our EMEA FX scorecard continues to send the most bullishsignals for the zloty," Danske said in a note dated October 2.The long-term valuation of the zloty looks particularlyattractive and we therefore see value in being long in the zlotyversus other currencies in the region."
