<raw><![CDATA[ REYKJAVIK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Icelandic police have detainedthe former chief of failed bank Landsbanki and another seniorexecutive as part of a probe into alleged crimes in the lead-upto the bank's collapse, the special prosecutor said on Friday. A municipal court judge would decide at around 1400 GMTwhether to keep the executives in detention on suspicion ofmarket manipulation ahead of the financial meltdown that hit theisland's economy, prosecutor Olafur Thor Hauksson told Reuters. The two executives being held by police are formerLandsbanki Chief Executive Sigurjon Arnason and Ivar Gudjonsson,the former head of the bank's investments arm. Hauksson, the former sheriff of a small town outsideReykjavik, has been investigating alleged crimes in the lead-upto Iceland's bank collapse, such as market manipulation, insidertrading and cases of loan approvals without sufficientcollateral. No cases have yet been brought to trial. Landsbanki and the North Atlantic island's other maincommercial banks collapsed in October 2008 under the weight ofhuge debts amassed over years of aggressive overseas expansion,shattering the financial system and Icelandic currency. Hauksson said this week he was questioning seven formerLandsbanki executives after searches were carried out at threebuildings in Reykjavik, in an investigation of allegedlarge-scale market manipulation and fraud.
