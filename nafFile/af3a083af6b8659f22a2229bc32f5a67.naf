<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro forecasts downgraded again on Greek contagion fears * Euro seen at $1.28 in a year * Sterling seen gaining ground vs. euro  By Jonathan Cable LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - The euro will struggle over thecoming year, according to the latest Reuters foreign exchangepoll which again saw analysts paring back forecasts for thebattered common currency as the Greek debt crisis rumbles on. The poll of 58 analysts, taken April 29-May 5, predicted theeuro would slide to $1.28 in a year, under the one-year low of$1.2936 it knocked earlier on Wednesday and 2 cents below theApril poll consensus forecast. In February's poll the euro wasseen at $1.40 in a year. The poll saw cuts across the board for one-, three-, andsix-month forecasts with fears about contagion in the euro zonegripping investors. The one-month forecast was cut to $1.32 from $1.34 lastmonth while the six-month forecast dropped to $1.29 from $1.32.The euro has fallen almost 9 percent from an intraday peak forthe year of just under $1.46 struck in January. "Our outlook for the euro remains negative. We recentlyadjusted our euro forecasts, essentially pulling ouralready-weakening euro forecasts a quarter forward while lookingfor additional weakness in 2011," said Meng Jiao at BofAML. "The current Greek debt crisis has made explicit the coreproblems within the euro zone -- having a common currency andmonetary policy but very different fiscal and labour marketpolicies." European finance ministers triggered a record 110 billioneuro ($147 billion) bailout for debt-stricken Greece on Sundayafter Athens committed itself to years of painful austeritymeasures. Investors fear the country's economic woes may spread toother vulnerable euro zone members such as Spain and Portugal.But a Reuters poll last week gave only a median 9 percent chancethat Greece would leave the 16-nation bloc.  POUND STAMP ON EURO In the second half of last year the euro zone economyemerged from its worst post-war recession but is expected to dolittle more than tick over in coming quarters. Economists polled by Reuters earlier this month expected thebloc's economy to grow 1.0 percent this year and 1.5 percentnext. Consensus predictions showed inflation will remain belowthe ECB's two percent target ceiling until at least 2012. The European Central Bank is not expected to move rates fromtheir record low of 1.0 percent until next year at the earliestto maintain the muted growth path which contrasts far morebuoyant growth expected in the United States. "Upbeat fundamentals leave the dollar with the upper hand --at least in the short term," said Niels Christensen at Nordea. Against sterling the euro was seen losing ground as the Bankof England unwinds its loose policy and begins to raise ratesearlier than the ECB. Cross rates calculated by Reuters show it trading at 87pence in one month and then weakening to 85 pence in a year. Thecurrencies nearly reached parity at the end of 2008 buteconomists gave only a 10 percent probability they would do soagain within six months. Euro volatility against the dollar was seen rising to 10.7percent over the coming month, compared to actual volatility of9.8 percent last month. Analysts say the divergence of forecastsin Reuters currency polls offers a leading indicator of exchangerate volatility in the following month.
