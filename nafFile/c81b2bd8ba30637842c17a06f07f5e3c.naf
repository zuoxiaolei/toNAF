<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The euro edged higher against the U.S. dollar on Monday, amid profit taking on the dollar, but the single currency remained under pressure as concerns over the regions debt crisis weighed.EUR/USD hit 1.3557 during late Asian trade, the daily high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3551, easing up 0.02%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.3448, the low of January 21 and resistance at 1.3734, last Thursday’s high.Speculation that Portugal would have to follow Ireland in seeking a bailout mounted Friday as yields on 10-year Portuguese debt climbed above 7%, to hit euro lifetime highs.Analysts consider 7% to be a major threshold for whether countries in the 17-nation euro zone can handle debt repayments.Uncertainty also remained over who would head up the European Central Bank after Bundesbank president Axel Weber, who had been seen as front-runner to succeed ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, announced Friday that he was to leave his central banking job.Meanwhile, the euro was down against the pound, with EUR/GBP shedding 0.39% to hit 0.843.Later in the day, the euro zone was to release official data on industrial production.             ]]></raw>
