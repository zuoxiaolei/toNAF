<raw><![CDATA[ * Developing countries to sign trade accord this week * Deal to allow diversification of trade revenue BRASILIA, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Nearly a dozen developingcountries led by Brazil and India will sign an accord this weekto cut tariff barriers and boost trade among themselves, asenior Brazilian government official said on Monday. Negotiations under the Global System of Trade PreferencesAmong Developing Countries were relaunched in 2005 in anattempt to diversify developing countries' trade revenue andreduce their dependence on rich countries. Around 43 countries are signatories to the original GSTPagreement from 1988, and 11 countries will sign the updatedaccord in southern Brazil this week. Under the deal, countries will cut applied tariffs by 20percent on 70 percent of their products. "So far the GSTP had no importance at all ... it was morepolitical, now it has become an instrument for opening trade,"Carlos Marcio Cozendey, head of the Brazilian foreignministry's department of economics, told a news conference. The agreement covers fast-growth economies with combinedgross domestic product of around $5 trillion and nearlyone-third of the world's population. The other signatories are Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay,Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Morocco, Egypt and Cuba. But the accord's ability to generate large new trade flowsis likely to be limited, as countries are granted significantexemptions and tariffs could remain prohibitive if they werehigh to begin with. In addition, some countries do not have proper trade tiesor adequate infrastructure to act on the new incentives. "It's an accord that allows you to protect your sensitivegoods but gives you a larger number of small preferences on abig array of products," said Cozendey. "It's an agreement to open new opportunities, it doesn'tfocus on existing trade." In Brazil, manufacturers are more likely than farmers tobenefit from new access to markets in Asia and elsewhere. Critics say the administration of outgoing President LuizInacio Lula da Silva focused too much on building stronger tieswith other developing countries, while neglecting itstraditional partners in Europe and the United States.
