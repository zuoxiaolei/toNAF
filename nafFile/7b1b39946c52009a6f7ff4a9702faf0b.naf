<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar surges vs yen, euro on surprise jobs data * U.S. Nov job loses at 11,000 vs forecast of 130,000 * Talk of renewed yen carry-trade emerging (Updates prices, adds quotes) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The dollar on Friday posted itsbest performance against a basket of currencies in nearly ayear after data showed the United States lost far fewer jobsthan expected last month, bolstering hopes the economy is on astable path to recovery. Employers cut 11,000 non-farm jobs last month while marketshad expected job losses of 130,000. The surprisingly strongreport stoked speculation the Federal Reserve may considerraising interest rates from record lows sooner than initiallythought. That would increase returns on dollar-denominated assetsand make them more attractive again to investors.    "The market is pricing in more scope for changes in Fedpolicy, meaning, higher interest rates. That's why we're seeinga rally in the dollar," said Paresh Upadhyaya, senior portfoliomanager at Putnam Investments in Boston. Upadhyaya helpsoversee assets of about $20 billion.  Alan Ruskin, chief currency strategist, at RBS GlobalBanking and Markets in Stamford, Connecticut, said the jobsreport has brought forward the date of the market's expectedFed tightening by one month. As a result, the dollar broke above 90 yen for the firsttime in four weeks. It was last up 2.5 percent at 90.38 yenJPY=>, its largest one-day gain since late October last year. Putnam's Upadhyaya, however, said, he's not putting toomuch into this dollar rally. "First of all, it's a Friday andits December, so there's usually very poor liquidity. Ifanything, this is a technical washout." The euro fell below $1.49 and posted its worst performancesince July. By late afternoon trading, the euro was down 1.5percent at $1.4850, well off an intra-day peak at $1.5091. The ICE Futures' dollar index, a measure of its valueversus six currencies, gained 1.5 percent to 75.78, its biggestone-day jump since mid-December last year. The dollar index has lost 7 percent so far this year asmarkets have bet that the United States would lag recovery inthe rest of the world, and the Fed would keep interest rateslow indefinitely. "A jobs recovery is the last piece of the puzzle before wecan say we're in full recovery, so it raises the question thatmaybe rates will go up sooner rather than later. That's pushedthe dollar higher," said Fabian Eliasson, vice president of FXsales at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York. The dollar rose 1.7 percent to 1.0163 Swiss francs afterearlier falling below parity, while sterling fell 0.7 percentto $1.6449. Recent Fed statements about keeping U.S. rates low for anextended period have encouraged investors to use the dollar asa funding vehicle to purchase higher-yield assets. But analysts said the data today forced many traders tocover short-dollar positions and may signal the end of tradesthat blindly sell the dollar on strong economic news. "If (signs of a job recovery) continue, you may start tosee the dollar rally on strong data rather than the opposite,"Mizuho's Eliasson said.             ]]></raw>
