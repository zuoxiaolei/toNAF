<raw><![CDATA[© Reuters. Dollar firmer after Fed statementInvesting.com - The firmer dollar was steady against the euro and the yen on Thursday a day after the Federal Reserve indicated that interest rates could start to rise around mid-year.USD/JPY was last at 117.66, after rising to overnight highs of 118.09.Following its policy meeting on Wednesday, the Fed said it would keep rates on hold at least until June and reiterated its pledge to be patient on raising interest rates, while acknowledging the solid economic recovery and strong growth in the labor market.The central bank also said it expected inflation to keep declining in the short term and added that it would take "financial and international developments" into account before deciding when to hike borrowing costs.EUR/USD was little changed at 1.1287, off Wednesday’s highs of 1.1382.The euro remained under pressure after Greece’s new government moved Wednesday to roll back deeply unpopular austerity policies underpinning the county’s €240 billion international bailout, fuelling fears over a clash with its international creditors.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was at 94.83 , holding below last Friday’s more than 11-year highs of 95.77.             ]]></raw>
