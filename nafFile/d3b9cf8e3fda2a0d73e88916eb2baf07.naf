<raw><![CDATA[ * Trade ties move beyond resources and infrastructure * State-backed projects still get lion's share of funding By Lucy Hornby and Deborah Kan BEIJING/HONG KONG, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Energy deals tookcentre stage during a southern African tour by China'sleader-in-waiting, but the growing ties between China and Africaare quickly moving beyond the traditional sectors of energy andinfrastructure. Vice President Xi Jinping this week wrapped up a visit toSouth Africa, Angola and Botswana. Xi, who is expected to succeedHu Jintao as head of the ruling Communist Party in 2012,witnessed the signing of deals worth millions of dollars to builda power plant and solar panel factory and to increase SouthAfrican exports to China. [ID:nLDE6AG1IO] [ID:nLDE6AK07D]. Less visible during state visits but increasingly importantis trade in sectors besides resources. Chinese consumer goods aremaking huge inroads in African markets, and more and more Chinesefirms are exploring manufacturing deals. "The key trend going forward here is that we're seeinghundreds of thousands, literally, of micro Chinese entrepreneurs,procuring from China and selling at the grassroots to Africanconsumers," said Martyn Davies, chief executive of FrontierAdvisory in Johannesburg. "At the higher end, in more formalised retail ... maybe threequarters of their procurement, non-food, is from China," he said. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For Insider interviews with:  Frontier Advisory's Martyn Davies http://r.reuters.com/cuc76q  Tsinghua University's Xue Lan     http://r.reuters.com/cak76q  World Bank's Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala  http://r.reuters.com/buc76q For a graphic on Sino-Africa trade: http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/RNGS/NOV/AFRICA.jpg ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ While China sees Africa as a prime source for the oil andminerals that its hungry economy needs, the continent is also apromising market for everything from tiny hair decorations toautomobiles churned out by China's fiercely competitivemanufacturers. "There are a lot of complementarities between the Chinese andAfrican economies," said Xue Lan, dean of public policy atTsinghua University in Beijing. Better infrastructure in Africa can help move ore and oilout, and let more consumer goods in. Textiles already make up 16percent of African purchases from China; footwear and clothingaccount for another 14 percent. Craig Bond, China head for Standard Bank , SouthAfrica's biggest bank, said China's prime objective in Africa isobviously to obtain access to natural resources, but there'sanother objective in the longer-term. "The second one is looking at the long game of those marketsbecoming consumer markets for Chinese goods," Bond said. GROWTH TIES China has traditionally encouraged its state-owned companiestendering for African contracts to team up with one of its policybanks, such as ExIm Bank, whose remit is to support governmentgoals [ID:nLDE6AK0E8]. But as China's engagement with Africa deepens, the financingneeds could be a stretch even for deep-pocketed policy lenders:the World Bank has identified a $31 billion shortfall in thecontinent's infrastructure funding requirements. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China <601398.SS><1398.HK>, the world's largest bank, is one of the banks thatBeijing is coaxing to broaden its footprint in Africa. It owns 20percent of Standard. As living standards rise, other opportunities beckon. Africain 2008 had about 80 million households with income above $5,000a year -- roughly the population of China's four largest cities. By 2020, that number could grow to about 130 million. "There's a lot to be said: the telecoms sector is booming,infrastructure is booming, services are booming," said NgoziOkonjo-Iweala, the World Bank's managing director. With a population of 800 million and growing, sub-SaharanAfrica will soon approach the size of China or India, two membersof the BRIC grouping. The others are Brazil and Russia. "We're talking about Africa now as another BRIC,"Okonjo-Iweala said. "So this is a vast market for all kinds ofgoods, both consumer goods as well as industrial goods."
