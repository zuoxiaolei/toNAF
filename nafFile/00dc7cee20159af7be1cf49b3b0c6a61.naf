<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The euro trimmed gains against the yen on Tuesday, retreating from the two day high hit after Japan’s finance minister said his country planned to buy bonds issued by Europe’s financial-aid funds.EUR/JPY hit 107.86 during European morning trade, the pair’s highest since Friday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 107.38, gaining 0.34%.The pair was likely to find support at 106.81, Monday’s low and a four month low and resistance at 108.54, Friday’s high.Earlier Tuesday, Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said his country planned to buy about a fifth of the bonds the European rescue fund plans to sell later in the month to finance its bailout scheme for Ireland.“It’s appropriate for Japan to make a contribution as a leading nation to increase trust in the deal. We want to buy more than 20%,” Noda said.However the impact of the statement was short lived after he indicated that Japan would like to make the purchase with euro cash holdings already in its foreign currency reserves.Meanwhile, the euro was lower against the U.S. dollar, with EUR/USD dipping 0.07% to hit 1.2942.Later in the day, the Bank of Japan was to publish a report on bank lending and the country’s current account.             ]]></raw>
