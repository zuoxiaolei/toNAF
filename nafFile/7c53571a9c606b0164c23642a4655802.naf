<raw><![CDATA[  * Dollar buoyed by strong U.S. economic data * Market gives EU leaders time to resolve debt problem * Stellar China GDP stokes rate-tightening speculation(Updates prices, adds detail) By Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Thursday asbetter-than-expected housing and employment data suggested theU.S. economy was improving, though hopes Europe was getting ahandle on its debt crisis limited euro selling. Worries that China will try to choke off excessive growthwith higher interest rates also boosted the greenback bysparking a sharp decline in the Australian and New Zealanddollars. Australia exports natural resources to China, whichmakes its currency sensitive to China's economic outlook. Fordetails, see [ID:nN20126733] The U.S. dollar has struggled against major currencies inrecent weeks and some say that decline coupled with signs ofstronger U.S. growth may spark a near-term rally. A sharp rise in existing U.S. home sales and a decline infirst-time jobless applications was a hopeful sign as highunemployment and a depressed housing market are the biggestobstacles to a robust recovery. [ID:nN20105802] "We are finally seeing some growth and we have to at leastthink about when the Federal Reserve will (tighten) policy,even though it won't happen soon," said Jens Nordvig, globalhead of G10 FX strategy at Nomura. As such, "it's possible to make money from a broad-baseddollar exposure through a basket including yen, the Aussie andCanadian dollars and sterling," he said. The greenback hasstruggled against all those currencies in recent months. Signs of stronger growth also pushed bond yields higher onThursday, helping the dollar rise 1.2 percent to 83.03 yen and 1.3 percent to 0.9677 Swiss francs .  The euro fell as low as $1.3396, though it recovered to$1.3466 , unchanged on the day, and was withinstriking distance of Wednesday's two-month high of $1.3539. The Aussie  fell 1.3 percent to $0.9870 while theNew Zealand currency shed 1.5 percent to $0.7579 . STILL EURO UPSIDE Among major currencies, the euro did best in holding itsground against the greenback on Thursday. Sentiment has latelyfavored the single currency, with persistent demand fromsovereign accounts affording euro-zone officials time to makeprogress on finding a sustainable solution to a debt crisis. Euro zone officials were said to be considering letting theEuropean Financial Stability Facility, the bloc's bailout fund,purchase or help finance the purchase of government debt fromtroubled euro-zone nations. [ID:nLDE70J0CB] That has helped ease selling pressure on debt from Portugaland Spain. Technical analysts said the euro's ability torebound from a brief dip below its $1.3435 100-day movingaverage was a bullish sign. Investors still worry that high financing needs in Spainand Portugal could push both to seek emergency rescue funds.Ratings agency Fitch said more bailouts of the sort given toIreland and Greece are still a high risk. [ID:nLDE70J206]   But if euro zone leaders manage to get things under control,investor anxiety may shift elsewhere. "If the market starts to sense that Spain risk is lower,then all of a sudden....it's going to be back to (thinking)what's the one country in the world that has yet to come upwith a fiscal adjustment, and that's the United States," saidKevin Daly, who helps oversee about $6 billion in assets atAberdeen Asset Management. "That's when the euro starts to goback up." (Additional reporting by Julie Haviv and Wanfeng Zhou in NewYork; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)             ]]></raw>
