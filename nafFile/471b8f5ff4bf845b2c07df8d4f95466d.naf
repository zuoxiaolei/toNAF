<raw><![CDATA[ * Russia c.bank sees no reason for big rouble move * Capital outflows to slow in 2010: Ulyukayev * Scope for another 100 bps of rate cuts this year  By Lidia Kelly, Toni Vorobyova and Yelena Fabrichnaya MOSCOW, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Russia's rouble should remainbroadly stable for the rest of the year, central banker AlexeiUlyukayev told Reuters on Friday, and there could be scope for up to 1 percentage point in further economy-boosting rate cuts. Some investors had been expecting a second wave of roubleweakness this autumn after Russia spent some $200 billion of itsreserves on a controlled devaluation in late 2008-early 2009. "Small fluctuations from the current rate are possible bythe end of the year, which could be measured in 10s of kopecksin one or other direction," Ulyukayev, one of the bank's threefirst deputy chairmen, said in an interview at the ReutersRussia Investment Summit. "I do not see reasons for big fluctuations." Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Friday that theauthorities would not allow excessive strengthening of therouble.    Ulyukayev said the central bank's plans for allowingthe rouble to float freely had already "virtually" happened. The rouble on Friday hit a six-week high of 36.98 againstthe euro-dollar basket the central bank uses to fix thecurrency's daily exchange rate. Ulyukayev also said that this year's net capital outflowshould be around $40 billion, adding that in 2010 "there will bean insignificant outflow, smaller than this year". The roublewas hit hard in late 2008 when investors fled to safer havensand Russia's oil and commodity exports plunged. Russia's gold and foreign currency reserves -- the world'sthird largest -- should remain at the current level of around$400 billion by year-end, he said. The cash pile is currently held in 47 percent in dollars,around 40 percent in euro and 10 percent in sterling, but in thefuture Russia would like to add another two or three currencies. "The investment in U.S. Treasuries is quite high and is notdecreasing, it is over a third," Ulyukayev said.  RATE CUTS EYED The central bank is set to continue with its policy ofmonetary easing after cutting the benchmark refinancing by 225basis points since April to 10.75 percent as it seeks to helpthe economy out of its first recession in a decade. "There is a theoretical possibility to lower rates byanother 1 percentage point by the end of the year," Ulyukayevsaid. Analysts polled by Reuters expect at least another 50basis points in cuts this year. Investors have been on tenterhooks for another cut sinceUlyukayev said mid-August a move could be expected "any day". Herepeated that phrase on Friday. Expectations of an imminent cut intensified last week, whendata showed inflation at a 4-year low in August. Russia's central bank does not usually pre-announce thedates of its rate decisions. Ulyukayev said a board meeting wasscheduled for Monday, Sept. 14, but declined to say whether arate cut would be unveiled then.
