<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The Australian dollar fell to a 5-day low against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday, after data showed that Australian business confidence declined for the fifth consecutive month to hit a 14-month low.AUD/USD hit 0.9088 during European afternoon trade, the pair's lowest since August 3; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.9091, tumbling 0.81%.The pair was likely to find support at 0.9044, the low of August 2 and resistance at 0.9220, the high of August 6 and a 3-month high.Late Monday, the National Australia Bank said its index of business confidence fell to 2 in July, down from 4 in June.Commenting on the report, Alan Oster, chief economist at NAB said “The prospects for domestic demand in the second half of 2010 have weakened significantly.”He added that slower economic growth “will need to be watched and in this environment inflation in the September quarter is unlikely to provide a November trigger" for an interest rate increase.The Aussie was also down against the euro, with EUR/AUD gaining 0.26% to hit 1.4465.Later in the day, Fed policy makers were to meet ahead of the banks interest rate announcement. Recent weak U.S. economic data gave rise to speculation that the bank would introduce fresh measures to stimulate U.S. growth.              ]]></raw>
