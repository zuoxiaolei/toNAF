<raw><![CDATA[ * Asia ex-Japan stocks down 1.4 pct, near 3-wk lows * Dollar steadies after rebound against majors * Japanese policymakers voice concern over yen's rally * Nikkei bounces from 13-month low, closes at month low By Umesh Desai HONG KONG, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Asian stocks slid to a nearthree-week low on Thursday on growing doubts about globaleconomic growth that also helped the dollar cling to its gainsafter it scored its biggest rise in nearly two years. The dollar climbed against all major currencies save forthe yen, which hit a 15-year high against the U.S. currency onWednesday, prompting Japanese policymakers to voice concernabout the currency's strength. The verbal intervention and news that the Bank of Japanchecked dollar/yen rates with banks -- an unusual step lasttaken during the yen's rally in November -- pushed the yenlower, helping Tokyo shares pare early losses. High yielding currencies such as the Australian and NewZealand dollars and commodity prices also wilted following newsof a surprisingly large U.S. trade deficit and a dowgrade ofBritain's growth forecast by the Bank of England. European markets were marginally higher in early trade withBritain's FTSE 100 , Germany's DAX  and France'sCAC-40  all up by about 0.2 percent. But gains werelimited as banks fell on concerns about the global recovery. The U.S. trade gap widened 18.8 percent in June, suggestingits second-quarter economic growth was weaker than previouslythought. The report follows the Federal Reserve's gloomiereconomic outlook published earlier this week and a spate ofdata from China confirming its rapid imports and factory outputgrowth was slowing. [ID:nN11206050] "We could see economies relapse and double dip or strugglethrough and begin to grow with private demand starting to carrytheir weight," said Peter Elston, strategist at Aberdeen AssetManagement, which oversees $52 billion of Asian equities. "It is very unclear which of those two we are going to get.On a day like this, clearly the bears are in the driving seat." The trade data clobbered the three major U.S. indexes,which logged their worst percentage drops in nearly a month asinvestors fled to safer assets. [.N] The MSCI index of Asia Pacific ex-Japan stocks fell 1.4 percent, led by resources and energy sectors . It is atits lowest since July 23 and has slid back into negativeterritory for the year to date. The flight to safety supported bids for U.S. Treasurieswith the 10-year yields at near a 16-month low. [US/] Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar held gains against a basket ofother major currencies  after rising nearly 2 percent atone point overnight, well above its 200-day moving average. It hovered above a 15-year low against the yen, tradingflat on the day at 85.30 yen . Overnight, the dollar hita 15-year low of 84.72 yen on electronic trading platform EBS. The yen's move away from its peaks helped Japanese stocksrecoup some of earlier losses and the Nikkei average closed 0.9 percent down after it hit a 13-month low earlier inthe session. Many Japanese exporters had set their currency rateassumptions at around 90 yen per dollar for the financial yearto next March. The yen has gained nearly 9 percent against the dollar sofar this year as investors looked to lower-risk assets, eventhough Japan's economy appears far more frail than that of theUnited States. RISKY ASSETS RETREAT The Australian dollar, which is highly influenced by globalgrowth expectations, struck a two-week , and the NewZealand dollar  was down to a three-week low. Bothrecovered but were still nursing steep losses from recenthighs. Adding to the Aussie's woes was data which showed Julyunemployment rose more than expected, which lessens the risk ofwage pressures building and argues against a further rise ininterest rates any time soon. [ID:nSYU010465] Oil slipped for a third straight day on mounting fears thata slowdown in the global economic recovery would cutcommodities demand. London Brent crude futures  fell 84 cents to $76.80a barrel, afte5r falling as much as $1 at one point. Gold regained strength after falling the previous day wheninvestors sold bullion to cover losses in equities, but afirmer dollar was likely to cap gains. Spot gold  rose $2.20 to $1,199.20 an ounce, stillhovering below the closely-watched 50-day moving average.
