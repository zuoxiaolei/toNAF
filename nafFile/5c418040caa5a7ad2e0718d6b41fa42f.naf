<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro/dlr hits 2-1/2-month low, DXY at highest since Oct * EZ bank, fiscal concerns, ZEW slip prompt euro selling * Year-end short covering boosts dollar broadly (Adds comment, details, updates prices) By Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The euro hit a 2-1/2-month lowagainst the dollar on Tuesday, stung by concerns about thehealth of euro zone banks, while a slip in German economicsentiment also prompted traders to dump the single currency. The dollar rallied broadly, scaling its highest versus acurrency basket since early October, as the view for ongoingweakness in the euro zone economy curbed risk demand andprompted short covering in the U.S. currency. The euro fell to $1.4527 according to Reuters data, itsweakest since early October, extending losses after the GermanZEW economic think tank said economic sentiment fell inDecember, suggesting an economic recovery may be sluggish. Austria's Die Presse reported on Tuesday the country'smonetary authorities had put Oesterreichische Volksbanken, thenation's No. 4 bank, on a watchlist.. OesterreichischeVolksbanken said the report was inaccurate. Still, risk-averse traders sold the euro following thereport, which came a day after Vienna on Monday said it wouldnationalise one of its banks to avoid a collapse. Tuesday's report highlighted banking woes and the weakfiscal positions of some euro zone countries. After having itscredit rating cut last week, Greece on Monday announced spendingcuts in an effort to rein in the country's debt. "Problems in Greece continue, and the news about theAustrian bank yesterday hasn't helped either," said IanStannard, currency strategist at BNP Paribas in London. "Overall, downward pressure on the euro continues, and theweak ZEW survey is also negative." By 1036 GMT, the euro traded at $1.4545, down 0.7 percent onthe day.  FED MEETS The euro's losses helped to push the dollar up to a2-1/2-month high of 76.913 against a currency basket. The dollar rallied across the board, climbing 0.9 percent to89.35 yen, while also rising against higher-risk currenciesincluding sterling and the Australian dollar. Following months of selling on the view U.S. interest rateswill stay low while those in other countries rise, the dollarhas rallied this month as strong U.S. economic data has spurredsome optimism the nation's economy is improving. Analysts said investors were keen to close short positionsbuilt up in the dollar all year before 2009 book closings, whichmay continue to support the dollar for the rest of the month. "There's still a lot of momentum to stop out short dollarpositions," said Carl Hammer, currency analyst at SEB inStockholm. The Australian dollar roughly 1 percent on the day againstthe U.S. currency, stung by minutes from the Reserve Bank ofAustralia's December meeting, which were not as hawkish as themarket had expected. Some saw the minutes as a possible sign the RBA may pauseits interest rate raising cycle. The Federal Reserve starts its two-day meet on Tuesday andis likely to keep rates unchanged near zero. Focus will be on the accompanying statement after upbeatU.S. sales and jobs data has spurred some speculation that theFed may begin winding down its fiscal stimulus measures soon,although few see this happening this month.
