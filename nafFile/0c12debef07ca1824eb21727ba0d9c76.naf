<raw><![CDATA[ * IMF says world economy to rebound by 3.1 percent in 2010 * IMF says global recession ending, recovery will be slow * Emerging economies ahead in the recovery, China leads (Adds details from news conference) By Lesley Wroughton ISTANBUL, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The world economy is finallystirring from a deep recession led by a swift turnaround inAsia, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday, raisingits forecast for global economic growth next year. After a year of being downbeat about prospects for the worldeconomy, the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook declared theglobal recession is ending. "The recovery has started. Financial markets are healing andin most countries growth will be positive for the rest of theyear as well as in 2010," the IMF's chief economist OlivierBlanchard told a news conference here before the start of WorldBank and IMF meetings. The Fund now expects world output to contract by 1.1 percentin 2009 before growing by 3.1 percent in 2010. This is moreupbeat than its last outlook in July when the Fund projected theworld economy would shrink 1.4 percent in 2009, before expanding2.5 percent in 2010. Meanwhile, a Turkish student threw a shoe which landed atIMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn's feet on Thursdayas he made a speech to students in Istanbul. The incident echoed that of an Iraqi journalist who lastDecember hurled his shoes, a grave insult in the Muslim world,at then U.S. President George W. Bush. Blanchard said at his news conference that the strength ofthe world economy will depend on rebalancing of global growth,in particular more domestic consumption in export-drivencountries like China and more savings in big-spenders like theUnited States. Leaders from Group of 20 nations last week agreed to adopt aframework by November for rebalancing economic growth. Blanchard also said it was hard to see how globalrebalancing could happen at current exchange rates. "If you think about global rebalancing you realize it isgoing to have to come from a number of measures and from anumber of adjustment. It is very hard to see how this couldhappen at the current exchange rates," he said. "In general, it is very hard to see how global rebalancingdoesn't come with an appreciation of Asian currencies," headded, without mentioning China's currency, the yuan, which theIMF has said is substantially undervalued.  The IMF report said beginning in late 2010, global growthis expected to average a little more than 4 percent a year,below the 5 percent growth rates before the financial crisiserupted, the IMF report said. While advanced economies will contract this year, they willbegin a fragile recovery in 2010, the report said. Both theUnited States and euro area will post growth, albeit at a tepidpace, next year, it added. Spain will be the only euro area member whose economy willcontract next year, the IMF said, adding that the pace of theeconomic decline in Europe has started to moderate. In contrast, emerging and developing economies are furtherahead in the recovery and will expand by 1.5 percent this yearbefore rebounding 5 percent next year led by China and India, itsaid, also noting signs of stabilization in Latin America. The IMF revised up China's growth forecast for next year to9 percent from a July estimate of 8.5 percent. Meanwhile, inJapan the economy is expected to recover by 1.7 percent nextyear, buoyed by fiscal and monetary stimulus measures. The Fund said the recovery in eastern Europe, which washardest hit by the financial crisis, will lag other emergingeconomies, especially the Baltic nations Latvia, Lithuania andEstonia.Still, the IMF cautioned that the pace of the overall globalrecovery is expected to be sluggish for quite some time and thebiggest risk is if governments withdraw their support too soon,causing the recovery to stall. It urged policymakers not to disrupt the recovery byrelaxing efforts to strengthen the financial sector and byprematurely withdrawing expansionary economic policies. In major economies, authorities can still afford to maintainaccommodative conditions for a while because inflation is likelyto remain subdued, the IMF said. The challenge going forward is to map a middle coursebetween unwinding stimulus measures too early and leaving themthere too long, which could damage government balance sheets. In emerging markets, raising interest rates could happensooner than in advanced economies, the IMF said, also warningthat in some countries warding off risks of new asset pricebubbles may require greater exchange rate flexibility.(Reporting by Lesley Wroughton; Editing by NeilFullick/Victoria Main)             ]]></raw>
