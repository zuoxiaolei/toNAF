<raw><![CDATA[ * Higher-yielding currencies dip vs yen * Some talk of euro/yen selling by Japanese exporters * BOJ easing speculation seen likely to temper yen rise * Sterling falters after weak housing data * Moody's says UK faces dilemma over bank support By Masayuki Kitano TOKYO, March 9 (Reuters) - The yen rose broadly on Tuesday ondollar and euro selling by Japanese exporters, while sterlingfaltered on weak data and after Moody's said Britain faces adilemma over its support for the banking sector. The yen also climbed with short-term traders taking cues froma dip in Nikkei share average and U.S. stock index futures, asdemand for riskier assets ebbed. "Japanese exporters are in the market and selling prettyactively, including the euro against the yen," said YujiMatsuura, joint general manager at Aozora Bank's forex andderivatives trading group. There could be more yen-buying by Japanese exporters duringthe week, and there might also be some flows in the last week ofMarch, just before they close their books at the end of Japan'sfiscal year, Matsuura said. Market players said, however, that gains in the yen have beenlimited by speculation that the Bank of Japan may take furthersteps to ease monetary policy. The euro fell 0.4 percent to 122.59 yen, off a two-week highof 123.90 yen struck on EBS on Monday. The euro also dropped against the dollar, dipping 0.1 percentto $1.3615 but was still well off last week's $1.3433, its lowestin more than nine months. The euro struggled after Greek Prime Minister GeorgePapandreou warned on Monday that if the Greek crisis worsened itcould lead to a new global financial meltdown.. Sterling fell 0.3 percent to $1.5014 and shed 0.7 percent to135.08 yen. Data showing that British house prices grew last month attheir slowest pace since August weighed on sterling. Another negative factor for sterling was a Moody's InvestorsService report saying Britain faces a difficult balancing act indeciding how and when to reduce support for the banking sector,given growth in the UK's public debt burden. EYES ON BOJ MEETING The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 90.01 yen. The greenback had rallied on the yen to a two-week high of90.69 yen on EBS on Monday, after a better-than-expected U.S.jobs report backed views that the U.S. Federal Reserve will liftrates faster than the Bank of Japan. The report had also bolstered demand for higher-yieldingcurrencies and riskier assets like stocks and commodities, onimproved economic prospects. The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent against the yen andthe New Zealand dollar shed 0.6 percent. The dollar is likely to be supported at levels around 89.50yen on speculation about more monetary easing steps from the BOJ,possibly at its policy meeting next week, said a trader for aJapanese trust bank. The BOJ meeting is in the spotlight after the Nikkeinewspaper reported on Friday that the BOJ was examining easingagain and may decide on such a move when it meets on March 16-17. Sources familiar with the matter said the BOJ is likely todebate this month easing its ultra-loose monetary policy again. The most likely next step for the BOJ is to expand thefund-supply operation it put in place in December, under which itlends to banks at 0.1 percent, either by increasing the size from10 trillion yen ($110.7 billion) or extending the duration ofloans from the current three months. Even if such steps are taken, the market impact could belimited given how low yen money market rates are already, said atrader for a European bank. "Basically, the aim may be to achieve an announcement effectand the market has factored in a lot of that," the trader said,adding that the dollar could fall against the yen if the BOJstands pat and unveils no new measures.(Additional reporting by Anirban Nag in Sydney, Satomi Noguchiand Kaori Kaneko in Tokyo; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)             ]]></raw>
