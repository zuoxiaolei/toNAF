<raw><![CDATA[ By Alister Bull WASHINGTON, July 23 (Reuters) - The Obama administrationwarned on Friday the U.S. economy had encountered "strongheadwinds" and the country's fiscal challenge remained grave,but it lowered an estimate for the budget deficit this year. In broad terms, no major changes were made in the updatedoutlook for the country's fiscal path over the next decade forthe country's deficits and debts, which the White House readilyadmit remain too high. "The economy is still struggling; too many Americans arestill out of work; and the nation's long-term fiscal trajectoryis unsustainable," the White House said in the annualmidsession review of President Barack Obama's budget. Americans are anxious about the deficit and could punishObama's Democrats in Nov. 2 midterm congressional elections forperceptions of big government spending and high unemploymentafter a severe U.S. recession. The White House Office of Management and Budget trimmed anexpected funding gap in the current fiscal year by $84 billionto $1.47 trillion, compared with the estimate released inFebruary. This deficit was expected to decline in 2011 to $1.42trillion, although this amount was $150 billion higher thaninitially forecast. "The U.S. economy still faces strong headwinds," the WhiteHouse said, citing a weak housing market and doubts about therecovery in Europe, which could sap demand for exports. "The European recovery is at risk because of increaseduncertainty while government stimulus is withdrawn, and afurther slowdown in Europe would pose problems for the rest ofthe world whose exports to Europe may be reduced," the WhiteHouse said.
