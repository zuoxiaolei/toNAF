<raw><![CDATA[ * Swiss govt sees growth slowing to 1.2 pct in 2011 * Raises 2010 GDP f'cast to 2.7 pct on strong H1 growth * Sees avg inflation slowing to 0.6 pct in 2011 * SNB seen striking similar tone in rate decision (Adds details, analysts view, background) ZURICH, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The Swiss government cut itsgrowth forecast for the Alpine economy for next year onThursday, saying that a weaker global economy and the strengthof the Swiss franc will slow its brisk recovery. The government's more sceptical view may set the tone forthe Swiss National Bank's interest rate decision and assessmentof the economy later in the day, when the central bank isexpected to hold interest rates steady due to the bleakeroutlook. The government predicted growth of 1.2 percent for 2011,compared to its June forecast of 1.6 percent growth, the StateSecretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) said. "The prospects for 2011 are less positive than recentlyassumed, due to modest world economic prospects as well ashigher valuation of the Swiss franc producing significant dragand having a negative influence on Swiss export growth," itsaid. The trade-weighted exchange rate of the franc against 40main trading partners stood now at levels last seen in themid-90s, the SECO said. "A gain in value of this magnitude will lead to significantdrops in export growth," it said, adding that export growthshould slow to 2.2 percent in 2011 from 7 percent in 2010. The franc has been gaining steadily since the central bankhalted intervention to quell its rise in June. It hit a recordhigh against the euro last week at 1.2763 and the SECO said afurther rise could not be excluded.  NO INFLATION The SECO raised its forecast for 2010 growth to 2.7 percentfrom 1.8 percent, due to the strong performance of the economyin the first half of the year. The SECO said that inflation should even ease further into2011, lowering its forecasts for 2010 to 0.7 percent and to 0.6percent for next year, well below the central bank's thresholdfor price stability of 2 percent. The central bank was now set to echo the SECO's assessmentand keep interest rates on hold as the weakening of the globaleconomy would inevitably hit the export-dependent country,Sarasin analyst Ursina Kubli said. "In such an environment, the SNB just cannot hike rates,"she said. In a Reuters poll conducted between Sept. 7 and 9, 37 of the38 economists saw the SNB keeping its 3-month LIBOR target at0.25 percent.  Switzerland has emerged from a deep recession less bruisedthan other countries thanks to the resilience of its consumers.While the economy has recorded strong growth over the pastquarters, indicators point to an imminent slowdown.
