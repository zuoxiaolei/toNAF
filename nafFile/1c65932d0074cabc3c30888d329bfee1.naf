<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower against the Swiss franc on Wednesday, as upbeat Chinese economic reports supported market sentiment and as worries over an imminent U.S. strike on Syria slightly eased.  USD/CHF hit 0.9334 during European morning trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.9341, edging down 0.08%.  The pair was likely to find support at 0.9289, the low of August 30 and resistance at 0.9392, the high of September 9.  Market sentiment remained supported after improved Chinese data on retail sales, industrial production and exports earlier in the week added to signs that the world’s second largest economy is recovering from a slowdown.  Elsewhere, President Barack Obama agreed on Tuesday to explore a plan proposed by Russia for Syria to place its chemical weapons under international control in order to avoid a U.S. military strike.  The Swissie was steady against the euro with EUR/CHF easing 0.07%, to hit 1.2393. In the euro zone, the head of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso said in a speech on Wednesday that a recovery is in sight and reiterated his call for the implementation of banking reforms, starting with the 'single supervisory mechanism'.             ]]></raw>
