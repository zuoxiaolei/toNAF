<raw><![CDATA[ * Shanghai, Shenzhen stocks plunge 5 percent as bears rule * Sudden drop in China hits Asia shares 2nd time in 3 days * Commodities, Australian dollar drop on equity weakness * Chinese banks on tap to report results  (Repeats to more subscribers) By Kevin Plumberg HONG KONG, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Chinese shares slumped 5percent on Wednesday and the rest of Asia and Europe followedon growing fears that global investors were pulling the plug ona 6-month rally amid doubts about a global economic recovery. Shanghai stocks tumbled to a two-month low ondisappointment that authorities were not taking steps tosupport the market amid increasingly heavy losses. A heady run-up in Chinese stocks this year has becomefirmly linked with global investors' desire to take on morerisks again for higher returns. The sharp reversal in China hasbadly shaken confidence, even though some form of correctionhad been widely expected after share prices ran up so fast. European stocks fell 1 percent in early trade while U.Sstock futures down 0.9 percent. Oil and metal prices and cyclical currencies like theAustralian dollar also fell as the selloff in China gainedpace. Shanghai shares slumped as much as 5 percent at one pointbefore settling 4.3 percent lower, taking their losses toaround 20 percent in just two weeks -- meeting the definitionof a bear market. Even with the latest reversal, the Shanghai index is stillup some 53 percent so far this year. Many international investors had hoped China would lead aglobal recovery as its economy picked up steam again. While itsrecovery trend looks intact, signs abound that consumer demandand company profits in the rest of the world remain weak,impeding a broad recovery. "I'm keen not to get on the wrong side of a correction atthis point," said Andrew Orchard, strategist with Royal Bank ofScotland in Hong Kong. "The conditions for a longer-term bull run are still inplace, after all this whole rally has been about liquidity. ButI think some valuations look overstretched." The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan slipped0.3 percent after being higher most of the day. The materialssector, which has led the rally in regional markets, was one ofthe biggest decliners. Japan's Nikkei share average finished 0.8 percent lower,hurt by Shanghai's decline and weakness in retailers andtechnology stocks, but Sanyo Electric surged as much as 17percent after a source said it would sell batteries for hybridcars to Toyota. POLICY DISAPPOINTMENT China's three most influential official securitiesnewspapers published bullish comments on Wednesday seeking totalk up the stock market. Short-term trading signals on Chinese stocks have movedswiftly from reflecting overbought conditions 12 trading daysago to now being slightly oversold. Still, the correction invaluations may have further to run. "Investors are disappointed that regulators failed to takeany concrete steps to support the market, while sentiment isextremely shaky after the market's tumble over the past twoweeks," said analyst Chen Huiqin at Huatai Securities inNanjing. Bank of Communications, the country's fifth-largest lender,will kick off Chinese bank first-half results on Wednesday,followed by two of the world's biggest banks by market valuelater in the week: Industrial and Commercial Bank of China andChina Construction Bank Pressure on net interest margins is expected to hurt thebanks' results despite barely receiving a scratch from theglobal credit crisis. The Australian dollar still remained largely shackled tothe whims of Chinese stocks, given the strengthening trade tiesbetween the countries. The Australian dollar dropped 0.4 percent in choppy tradeto US$0.8232 though was still near an 11-month high around$0.8477 reached on Friday. The U.S. dollar got a boost from the Chinese market'sweakness after a small dip overnight as Wall Street recovered.The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index rose 0.3 percent. Three-month copper traded on the London Metals Exchangefell 2.3 percent to $5,940 a tonne, while Shanghai copperdropped 3.3 percent to 46,400 yuan U.S. crude oil for September delivery fell by 0.4 percentto $68.93 a barrel as equity markets declined. Brent slid 0.8percent to $71.73 U.S. stock markets rose around 1 percent overnight,rebounding from sharp losses on Monday, as better-than-expectedresults from big retailers encouraged investors to get backinto the market. But analysts remain worried about laclustre consumerdemand. Many firms which have beat or met market expectationsthis earnings season have done so by cutting costs, not byincreasing sales.
