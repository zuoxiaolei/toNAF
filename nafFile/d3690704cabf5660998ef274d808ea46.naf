<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The pound was steady close to 31-month lows against the dollar on Monday, after ratings agency Moody’s downgraded the U.K.’s triple-A sovereign rating late Friday.GBP/USD pulled away from 1.5074, the pair’s lowest since July 2010, to hit 1.5140 during European afternoon trade, down 0.22%.Cable was likely to find support at 1.5074, the session low and resistance at 1.5272, Thursday’s high.Moody’s cut the U.K.’s sovereign rating by one notch to Aa1 with a stable outlook late Friday, citing a weak outlook for growth and a rising debt burden."There is a risk that the U.K government may not be able to reverse the debt trajectory before the next economic shock or cyclical downturn in the economy," Moody’s said.Earlier last week, the minutes of the Bank of England’s February meeting indicated that policymakers are moving closer to another round of monetary easing. In addition, the central bank’s quarterly inflation report this month showed that policymakers are prepared to overlook higher inflation in order to support growth.Elsewhere, sterling hit 16-month lows against the euro, with EUR/GBP rallying 1.12% to 0.8787.Sentiment on the single currency was boosted by optimism that economic reforms in Italy would not be derailed by election results, while speculation over a low voter turnout in northern Italy help ease concerns over a strong showing by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Exit polls were due to be published after voting closed at 3pm local time, with final results expected Tuesday.             ]]></raw>
