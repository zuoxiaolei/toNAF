<raw><![CDATA[ * Kudrin says stocks overheated on speculative capital * Says to support only soft measures to curb capital flows * Citi says Russia could succeed in capping inflows * Kudrin says rates more important than cash injections  (Releads with Kudrin on capital measures, adds analyst) By Toni Vorobyova and Lena Fabrichnaya MOSCOW, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Russian Finance Minister AlexeiKudrin said on Wednesday he will support only soft measures tocurb speculative capital inflows, while blaming them foroverheating Russian stocks in addition to the rouble. "We should be afraid of cheap money -- I mean speculativecapital inflows," Kudrin told an investment conference. "We, like many other markets, have received a large volumeof short-term speculative money from the world markets. Theyhave arrived, they are among us, and the index is inflated. Itis overheated," he said. Russian stocks have more than doubled in value since thestart of 2009, making them among the best performers globally.The rouble has rallied since September, threatening to underminethe recovery of Russia's export-oriented economy. The central bank, chaired by a close ally of Kudrin, SergeiIgnatyev, has cut rates to a historic low of 9 percent in a bidto slow the appreciation of the rouble and support the economy,including a 50 basis point cut on Tuesday. But despite cuts, Russian rates remain much higher than inmany developed nations, offering very attractive yields forcarry trade operations against rates of 1 percent or less inWestern economies. Central bank officials have already promised soft measuresto curb speculative inflows to emulate steps already taken byRussia's BRIC peers. Kudrin said Russia would not re-introducedirect capital controls, which it scrapped in 2006. "They cannot be direct restrictions on capital (flows). Imean they will be soft measures ... These can be reserverequirements, taxation on profits from transactions, nottransactions themselves," Kudrin told reporters.  CHANGING THE FLOWS Central bank officials have said soft measures could includechanges in reserve requirements, caps on banks' open foreigncurrency positions and also broader regulation on cross-borderaction such as taxes. Elina Rybakova from Citibank said all the above measureswere possible but the most important would be an introduction ofcaps on external borrowing by large public sector firms. State-run firms, such as Gazprom or Rosneft, have borrowedaggressively to fuel growth during the boom years and wouldseverely oppose the measure. Russian banks and firms have toservice over $400 billion in foreign debts. "There is a consensus globally among policymakers that it islegitimate to use capital controls on inflows. They (Russiangovernment) can be successful in changing the composition ofinflows," said Rybakova.  NO STATE CASH INJECTION Russian rate cuts have failed so far to translate to theentire banking sector, which is lending at 15 percent or more toindustries, fearing another spike in bad loans. Kudrin said Russia's economy still needed stimulus measuresvia low lending rates instead of state cash injections. "Our goal should not consist of trying to support demandfrom the budget ... Demand will appear if there are low lendingrates, if a businessman comes and says 'I want to build afactory'. Here is when the demand will appear," Kudrin said. The central bank's First Deputy Chairman Alexei Ulyukayevtold the same conference more cuts were possible because he sawlittle risk of a spike in inflation in the first half of 2010.
