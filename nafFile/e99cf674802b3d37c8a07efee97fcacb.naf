<raw><![CDATA[ * Iron ore, coking coal slowed fastest * Crude shipments grew * Metal shipments fell, with copper at 27-month low  By Tom Miles BEIJING, March 21 (Reuters) - China's imports of many majorcommodities all but dried up in February as a national holiday,abundant stockpiles and rising prices combined to discourageshipments, data from China's Customs office showed on Monday. Chinese demand is the motor of many world commodity markets,but this year prices have been driven more by supply disruptionsaround the world, while China's tighter monetary policy and acrackdown on speculators has reined in bullish buying. Two of the commodity imports that slowed fastest in Februarywere iron ore and coking coal, the raw materials used by China'svast army of steelmakers. February's imports of iron ore came in at 48.8 milliontonnes, falling back sharply from the previous month, when arush to fill orders before the week-long Lunar New Year helpedpush volumes to a monthly record of 69 million tonnes. A 7 million tonne bulge in iron ore stocks at China's portsso far this year, coupled with a cautious turn in steel pricesset by leading Chinese mills, point to weakening demand forsteel in the world's top steel market. Coking coal imports collapsed by almost two-thirds inFebruary, falling below 2 million tonnes for the first monthsince May 2009 as the impact of Australia's disastrous floodschoked supplies and pushed up global prices. Overall shipments of coal to China, including supplies forpower production as well as steelmaking, fell to 6.8 milliontonnes, with each of the top three suppliers -- Indonesia,Australia and Vietnam -- seeing trading volumes down by halffrom February 2010. China's mild winter helped subdue demand for coal and otherforms of energy in the first two months of the year, although adrought in wheat-growing areas prompted an emergency irrigationcampaign that added to demand for diesel, used to generatepumps. China's drought helped open the door to 115,864 tonnes ofAustralian wheat, likely degraded by flood damage and useful inChina's tight market for animal feed.  CRUDE UP, METALS DOWN Although the extra diesel demand helped increase China'soverall apparent consumption of oil by 10.2 percent fromFebruary 2010, the rise in demand owed something to stockpilingof diesel, with a 28 percent leap in reserves of the fuel as thegovernment capped exports. Imports of liquefied natural gas fell to the lowest in ninemonths. But a surge in pipeline gas from Turkmenistan, whichcame on stream a year ago, provided the same amount -- 660,000tonnes -- boosting access to the clean-burning fossil fuel,which is expanding its share of the Chinese market from a smallbase. Bucking the overall trend of slowing imports, crude oilshipments grew to the third-highest level ever in February, withIran, Sudan and Venezuela all seeing big year-on-year increasesin the volume shipped to China. Russian crude oil volumes, at 1.6 million tonnes, almostdoubled from January as the new ESPO pipeline began to hit itsstride. But Russian oil supplies in the first two months of theyear were still down by 18 percent from a year previously afteroil supplies switched to the pipeline, deserting the moreexpensive railway route used in the past. Chinese buying of base metals also hit the buffers inFebruary, with imports of refined copper tumbling 36 percent toa 27-month low as the trade finally succumbed to economics. The window for profitable shipments to China has been shutfor months, but the momentum of annual supply contracts hadhelped keep the metal flowing into China nevertheless. Traders estimate bonded stocks of copper, which have arrivedbut not yet paid value-added tax, have doubled to more than600,000 tonnes since early December. That pile of unconsummated imports casts a massive shadowover the world's biggest market for the metal, since it accountsfor roughly 50 percent more than China's own monthly productionof the metal. February net imports of primary aluminium and refined zincvirtually halved from January, although burgeoning Chineseproduction implied an overall increase in demand.
