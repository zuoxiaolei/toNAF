<raw><![CDATA[ * Economy ministry raises 2010 growth forecast * Fin Min says stronger oil may mean smaller deficit * Official warns more currency strength may hurt economy * Rouble hits highest level since Jan vs basket (Adds Kudrin; more quotes from Klepach, Ulyukayev; banks) By Darya Korsunskaya and Yelena Fabrichnaya MOSCOW, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Russia's economy ministry turnedmore upbeat on growth prospects for next year on Wednesday butsaid the strength of the rouble -- now scaling fresh highsversus a euro-dollar basket -- is a key risk. Growing investor appetite for emerging markets coupled witha rally in oil prices to one-year highs has improved the outlookfor the resource-rich economy, helping it clamber out of itsfirst recession in a decade in the third quarter. As a result, the economy ministry now reckons next year'sgrowth could top 2 percent if oil prices stay high, up from itsprevious forecast of 1.6 percent. Greater revenues from energy companies' taxes could alsoensure this year's budget deficit is smaller than expected,Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said. Russia's Urals oil hit one-year peaks of $77 a barrel thisweek, $20 higher than the level set in the budget. But on the flip side, high oil prices fan a rouble rally,which could eventually undermine competitiveness and growth. On Wednesday the rouble firmed to 35.63 versus a euro-dollarbasket, its strongest since January, and held near the previousday's peaks of 29.13 per dollar. "The appreciation of the rouble allows for lower inflation,increases trust in the banking system," Deputy Economy MinisterAndrei Klepach told reporters. "But the competitiveness of our (economy's) sectors remainslow and in the medium-term that creates fairly serious risks,"he added, noting that 26-27 roubles per dollar would be adangerous level. Previously, officials have said they are not concerned aboutthe current rouble levels as long as sharp fluctuations areavoided. On Wednesday, central bank First Deputy Chairman AlexeiUlyukayev reiterated that a strong rouble has both advantagesand disadvantages.  STRONGER ECONOMY LURES INVESTORS The central bank has regularly intervened in the currencymarket to keep the rouble appreciation gradual, allowing thecurrency to firm by 5 kopecks against the basket for each $700million of interventions. Since the start of October the central bank has purchasedsome $9 billion, according to Ulyukayev. Dealers said theintervention level is now at 35.60 per basket. Despite the interventions, the rouble has gained around 15percent from its February troughs, clawing back around half ofthe devaluation experienced at the height of the crisis. "If investors expect that the economy will grow, then thevalue of all assets will increase ... and this is reflected inthe strengthening of the national currency," Ulyukayev said,forecasting rouble gains could continue if oil prices stay high. One advantage of the stronger rouble though is a reductionof inflation through cheaper prices for imported goods. Consumer prices have been flat for 7 weeks, and Ulyukayevsaid 2009 inflation could be under 10 percent. Reduced price pressures, in turn, have enabled the centralbank to cut interest rates, further supporting the recovery byencouraging banks to offer cheaper loans to the real economy. "There is scope to cut rates (further) in the near future:before the end of this year and next year," Ulyukayev said Economic recovery can also be seen in the banking sector --central bank stress tests showed no major threat to the bankingsystem, while September saw the first fall in the volume ofnon-performing loans since the start of 2009. But Klepach remained cautious. "The crisis will (end) when growth will be sustainable. Weare awaiting this in the second half of next year," he said.
