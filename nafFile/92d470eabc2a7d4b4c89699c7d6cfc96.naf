<raw><![CDATA[ * Says to launch ETPs for all six major base metals * No launch date set yet  (Updates with comment, details, adds byline) By Amanda Cooper LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - UK-based ETF Securities said onMonday it would launch exchange-traded products for base metals,as it seeks to tap into a global market worth nearly $120billion that has been dominated by investment in gold. The new products will include copper, aluminium, zinc,nickel, lead, tin as well as a basket of all six major basemetals, although no launch date has yet been set. "This new platform is intended to provide investors withexposure to physical industrial metal without the need topurchase and store such metal directly," said Graham Tuckwell,chairman and CEO of ETF Securities. "These products will complement our existing offerings whichare priced off futures prices rather than cash market prices." A spokeswoman for the company said there had been nodecision as yet on where the products would be listed, but in anews release the company said further information on theproducts would be published in the future, subject toapproval from relevant regulators and the London Stock Exchange. Barclays Capital said in a research note the globalexchange-traded product market is now worth $119 billion, havingrisen by $2 billion in August alone. Barclays said more than 80percent of that total is tied up in precious metals, where goldis the dominant investment product. Gold has risen to record highs this year, driven in largepart by flows of capital into ETFs backed by physical metal asinvestors have sought an alternative to increasingly volatilestocks, bonds and currencies. Speculation has been rife this year in the metals marketsthat ETF Securities would introduce a product, or series ofproducts, linked to the industrial metals. ETF Securities said last month it had an account withLMESword, the London Metal Exchange's electronic transfer systemfor stock warrants. The LME, the world's largest base metals futures exchange,achieved turnover worth $29 billion on an average business daylast year. Prices of copper for three-months delivery on the LME haverisen by nearly 13 percent so far this year, and are tradingnear their highest for two years, above $8,300 a tonne.
