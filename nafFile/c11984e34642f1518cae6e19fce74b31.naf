<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro rebounds vs dollar, yen after recent falls * Mkt takes a breather ahead of U.S. GDP data at 1230 GMT * Higher-yielding Aussie, yen also rebound; stocks edge up (Updates prices; changes byline, dateline; previous TOKYO)  LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher against thedollar and the yen on Thursday as the market took a breatherahead of key U.S. gross domestic product data which is expectedto show a return to growth in the third quarter. A solid reading could help foster some renewed optimismabout the global economy, but sentiment stayed shaky after aslew of recent weak U.S. data and sharp falls on equity marketsthat has sparked steep gains for the dollar and the yen. Economists estimate that the government's advance estimatewill show GDP grew 3.3 percent in the third quarter, the firstquarter to show positive growth since the second quarter of 2008when the economy eked out growth of 1.5 percent. The euro earlier fell to its lowest in two weeks against thegreenback and the yen, and its modest bounce on Thursday stillleft it not far from those lows. "The U.S. GDP numbers will be very important and perhaps themarket is a bit hesitant ahead of this," said Elisabeth Andreew,currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen. "We've had a big sell-off on stock markets and it seems themarket is getting a bit of a reality check after such a hugerally. This has consequences for currencies, with the dollar andthe yen benefitting," she said. At 0843 GMT, the euro edged up 0.2 percent against thedollar to $1.4742 and was up 0.3 percent at 133.69 yen,recovering from earlier lows of $1.4683 and 132.81 yenrespectively. Sentiment was helped a little by a small rebound on stockmarkets, with European shares up 0.3 percent. The dollar index fell 0.1 percent to 76.314. It has gainedjust over 1 percent this week, leaving it on course for itsbiggest weekly gain in nearly five months. Perceived higher-risk currencies, which have come underheavy pressure recently, also rebounded, with the Australiandollar up 0.5 percent against the dollar at $0.9025 and up 0.5percent against the yen at 81.90 yen. The New Zealand dollar rose 0.6 percent against the dollar.It had fallen to a three-week low after the Reserve Bank of NewZealand (RBNZ) dropped its easing bias as expected but faceddown market pressure for a rate rise as soon as early 2010. "The past few days has been a correction of the dollar'ssell-off, which had gone too far," said Mitsuru Sahara, chiefmanager of currency derivatives trading at Bank ofTokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo. The Australian dollar fell around 2 percent against the U.S.dollar on Wednesday, clocking up its biggest one-day fall innearly two months, while the kiwi shed 3 percent, its steepestdrop since June, and lost 4 percent on the yen, its biggestdecline since February. Both have been favoured plays against the low-yieldingdollar and yen this year as investors have anticipated higherinterest rates in economies seen as recovering faster from theglobal downturn, and the Aussie has risen about 40 percentagainst the greenback since early March. U.S. GDP EYED Thursday's data is expected to reveal that the world'slargest economy has turned a corner, but U.S. data this week hasraised questions about a sustained recovery, with consumerconfidence dipping to recessionary levels and new home salesfalling unexpectedly. Goldman Sachs on Wednesday cut its forecast for GDP growthto 2.7 percent from 3.0 percent after a report on durable goods,noting that shipments have been somewhat weaker. Given the risk-trade correction underway, some dealers saidcurrency markets might react more to weaker figures thanstronger ones, and if so, that could give the dollar a bit morestrength short-term. "But the reaction to the GDP data could be limited asinvestors are probably waiting for big events like the Fed'spolicy meeting and the key U.S. jobs report next week," Saharaat Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo said. European data due on Thursday will also be watched,including euro zone sentiment indicators at 1000 GMT.(Additional reporting by Charlotte Cooper in Tokyo; Editingby Andy Bruce)             ]]></raw>
