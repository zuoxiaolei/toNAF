<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro zone services PMI trimmed to 55.8 from 56.0 flash * Composite euro zone PMI unrevised from flash at 56.7 * German growth strong, southern Europe lags * European firms hire workers at fastest pace since April 08 * Forced to cut prices to drum up business   (Adds details, background, comment) By Jonathan Cable LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The euro zone's dominant servicesector picked up speed last month, a survey showed on Wednesday,allaying fears of a double dip recession, but strong growth inGermany and France masked weakness in southern Europe. Markit said its final Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers'Index of around 2,000 companies, ranging from banks to hotels,rose to 55.8 in July from June's 55.5, showing a slight downwardrevision from a preliminary estimate of 56.0. The upturn was driven by Germany, Europe's largest economy,although growth there was not as strong as initially estimatedand, worryingly for policymakers, there is a growing dividebetween euro zone economies. Italy's service sector shrank afterseven months of growth while in Spain the pace of growthstumbled. Analysts say euro zone growth, so far boosted mainly byexports, will not become self-sustaining without a rebound inconsumer spending which has in turn been hold back byunemployment, stuck near 12-year highs. Official euro zone retail trade figures released onWednesday showed consumer spending remained soft in June. "There is a worry about the divergence. The countries on theperiphery will suffer more," said Silvio Peruzzo, economist atRBS. "The market could question the ability of the periphery tofind its way through." In Germany, the PMI showed services activity grew at itsfastest pace in nearly three years, while business inneighbouring France picked up at close to May's 44-month high. But while Germany's reading of 56.5 was higher than June's54.8 it was well below a flash estimate of 57.3 given late lastmonth. In the euro zone's major trading partner, Britain, servicesector business grew at its slowest pace in 13 months, with itsindex dropping to 53.1, way off forecasts and June's 54.4. Although this is the eleventh month that the euro zone'smain index has been above the PMI's 50 level that divides growthfrom contraction, firms cut prices to attract customers.The euro zone services output price index remainedstubbornly below the break-even mark for the 21st month at 47.9,although up from June's 47.4, as firms continued to chop pricesto attract business. "Companies still feel that they have limited pricing powerand have to price competitively to gain business. Input pricesrose at the slowest rate for three months in July but this stillmeant that service companies' margins were squeezed," saidHoward Archer at IHS Global Insight.  COMPOSITE CONFIDENT Even so, the composite PMI index, made up from the servicesand Monday's manufacturing sector numbers and often used topredict overall growth, rose to 56.7 this month from 56.0 inJune, in line with flash estimates. "The euro zone economic recovery remained very much on trackas we move into the second half of 2010," Chris Williamson atMarkit said, adding that gross domestic product (GDP) growth "isprobably running at a quarterly rate of 0.7 percent, the bestfor three years." The composite employment index, which turned positive inMay, jumped to 51.4 last month from June's 50.6, its highestreading since April 2008. Euro zone unemployment held steady at 10 percent for thefourth month running in June, adding to evidence that the16-nation bloc has recovered from its worst recession indecades. The euro zone economy grew 0.2 percent between January andMarch after a 0.1 percent expansion in the final three months of2009. The latest Reuters poll estimated that it grew a healthier0.6 percent in the second quarter but saw slower growth of just0.3 percent per quarter through to the middle of next year. The economy is seen growing 1.3 percent next year, comparedto 2011 forecasts for 2.0 percent in major trading partnerBritain and 2.8 percent for the United States, the world'sbiggest economy.(Editing by Ruth Pitchford)             ]]></raw>
