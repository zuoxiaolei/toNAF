<raw><![CDATA[ BERLIN, July 13 (Reuters) - The EU's trade commissioner saida ruling over European planemaker Airbus's bid to supply tankersto the United States was politically-motivated and that he wantsto talk to U.S. Trade Representrative Ron Kirk about it. EU Trade Commissioner Karel de Gucht said he believed aWorld Trade Organisation ruling late last month that statesubsidies had given Airbus an advantage over U.S. rival Boeing was one sided. De Gucht told Germany's Handelsblatt business daily theruling was being used against Airbus in its bid for a contractworth up to $50 billion for new tankers for the U.S. Air Force. "The WTO panel on Airbus is being used against uspolitically in Washington, for example with the tanker deal forthe U.S. Air Force," he told the newspaper. "That is a problem,and I want to talk to Kirk about it." A group of U.S. lawmakers has demanded that the Air Forcefactor the WTO ruling into their decision on the tankercompetition. WTO judges said late last month the EU must axe prohibitedexport subsidies to Airbus which had injured Boeing. The WTO panel concluded Airbus had been able to launch aseries of passenger jets only thanks to subsidies from the EUand member states Britain, France, Germany and Spain, withoutwhich it would be a very different and much weaker company. "Everyone knows that Boeing worked similarly to Airbus," deGucht said. "Instead of state aid, there were billions ofmilitary or civilian research contracts there. We expect the WTOwill recognise that by September at the latest." (Writing by Paul Carrel; Editing by Samia Nakhoul)             ]]></raw>
