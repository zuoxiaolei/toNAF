<raw><![CDATA[ * Asian stocks pull back from 22-month highs * Nikkei slips 1.35 pct as yen-weakening halts * Dollar up vs. most Asian currencies (Repeats to more subscribers) SINGAPORE, April 16 (Reuters) - Asian stocks retreated from22-month highs on Friday as fresh doubts about the U.S.economic recovery and Greece's rescue package prompted a broadpull back from risky assets. The doubts, plus record appetite for emerging market bonds,helped push up some regional government debt prices and thedollar gained broadly against Asian currencies. Stock markets could be on the verge of a correction after astrong run up as investors take some profits and shift thefunds into safer havens. "Having seen double digit gains in share markets sinceearly February, with expectations running very high coming intothe U.S. March quarter profit-reporting season and China stillin tightening mode, there is a high risk of a short-term pauseor correction in share markets." Shane Oliver, head ofinvestment strategy at AMP Capital Investors, said in anemailed note to clients. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan fellover 1 percent, led by information technology and consumerstaples, following a 16 percent rally from a February low. Although Wall Street firmed modestly on Thursday, S&P 500futures slipped 0.5 percent after Google Inc's earnings reportafter the close failed to impress investors accustomed toblowout results. The S&P 500 index eked out a gain of 0.1 percent in regulartrading as encouraging profits from United Parcel Service waspartly offset by an unexpected sharp rise in new jobless claimslast week. Japan's Nikkei average dropped 1.35 percent, its sharpestfall in over seven weeks, with a firmer yen offering investorsan excuse to take profits in exporters such as Tokyo Electron. "Expectations for solid earnings appear to have run theircourse as you can see in today's banking shares. The focus isnow shifting to this financial year to March rather thanimmediate numbers," said Hiroaki Kuramochi, chief equitymarketing officer at Tokai Tokyo Securities. LOW RISK The dollar dipped 0.3 percent against the yen to around92.73 yen but the dollar index, reflecting its trade against abasket of major currencies, rose 0.2 percent. The dollar showed more solid gains against Asian currencieswith the Korean won dropping 0.6 percent and the Malaysiaringgit down 0.5 percent. The Australian and New Zealand dollars struggled againstthe yen, slipping further from multi-month highs as sluggishequities prompted funds to take profits. The euro was on the backfoot, after the cost of insuringagainst a Greek default rose and spreads between Greek andGerman bond yields widened to near record levels. European officials and the IMF have agreed to makeavailable 45 billion euros in loans, but there are questionsabout how the package would be implemented. Japanese government bond futures rose to their highestlevels in a month, a day after a strong five-year auction andas traders took cues from a fall in Tokyo shares. South Korean government bond prices edged up early onFriday, with treasury futures extending gains on resumedforeign buying. Both benefited from U.S. Treasuries, which rallied as theweak U.S. labour market figures overshadowed surveys showingstrength in U.S. manufacturing. Latest data from fund-tracking firm EPFR showed thatemerging market bond funds set an all-time weekly inflow recordfor the week ending April 14, taking in $1.8 billion of newmoney. The combined emerging market equity funds tracked by EPFRGlobal showed a net investment inflow for the ninth straightweek in the second week of April, but the $996.6 million theytook in was only a third of the previous week's tally. Seoul shares edged lower and were down almost 0.9 percent. "The market has been on a steep upward run since lastmonth, perhaps a little too much a little too fast. It's now intechnical correction territory," said Lim Dong-min, a marketanalyst at KB Investment & Securities. Shares in Australia retreated 0.5 percent by midday, withbanks giving up morning gains and miners weighed down bylacklustre base metals prices. U.S. crude futures slipped towards $85 a barrel, adding tolosses the previous day when a firmer dollar and mixed economicdata sapped sentiment. (Editing by Neil Fullick)             ]]></raw>
