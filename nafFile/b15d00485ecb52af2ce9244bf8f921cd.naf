<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro close to 1-yr low vs dollar as Greece worries persist * Dollar rises to 8-1/2 mth high vs yen on strong U.S. data * Aussie falls after RBA hikes but signals pause ahead  By Jessica Mortimer LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near one-yearlows versus the U.S. currency on Tuesday as concerns about Greekdebt persisted, while robust U.S. data helped lift the dollar toan eight-and-a-half month high versus the yen. The Australian dollar fell versus its U.S. counterpart afterthe Reserve Bank of Australia raised interest rates butsignalled a pause in rate hikes ahead. At the weekend, European finance ministers agreed a 110billion euro bailout package for Greece, but analysts saiddoubts remained about how the country would implement steepbudget cuts, with unions planning more strikes.    The packagestill needs parliamentary approvals, while the question ofwhether other vulnerable euro zone countries might also needhelp lingered in investors' minds. "People are still concerned about whether Greece will beable to fulfil its budget requirements and about how the publicwill react, whether there will be more social unrest," saidNiels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen. At 0754 GMT, the euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.3165, closeto its one-year low of $1.3112. The U.S. dollar gained broadly after data on Monday showedU.S. manufacturing registered its fastest pace of growth innearly six years in April, while consumer spending rose in Marchfor a sixth straight month. The data showed the U.S. economy continues to recover, whichanalysts said may allow the Federal Reserve to start raisinginterest rates later this year.  By 0739 GMT, the dollar was up 0.2 percent at 94.78 yen,close to an earlier high of 94.98 yen, its strongest since Aug.24. Traders saw key technical resistance for the dollar againstthe yen near 95.10, which is the 61.8 percent retracement of thedollar's decline from 101.5 to 84.70 yen in 2009. WEAK YEN; AUSSIE FALLS Expectations the Bank of Japan will keep rates low for aprolonged period dented the yen as concerns about Japan's fiscalposition grew, with its public debts nearing 200 percent of GDP. A senior IMF official warned on Monday that Japan may facebond sales problems if it failed to work out a crediblemedium-term fiscal reform programme. "With U.S. interest rate expectations slowly building andthe BoJ looking at new ways to stimulate the economy, we expectU.S.-Japanese yield spreads and a bear flattening of the U.S.yield curve to play strongly into the hands of dollar/yen," INGcurrency strategist Tom Levinson said in a note. The Aussie dollar fell 0.6 percent to $0.9210 after theReserve Bank of Australia raised its key rate by 25 basis pointsto 4.5 percent, but also signalled the first stage of itstightening cycle was over after six hikes in eight months. "The RBA signalled there would be a pause in the rate hikecycle, which has dampened expectations for further hikes andprompted investors to take profit on long Australian dollarpositions," Nordea's Christensen said. Sterling fell 0.2 percent against the U.S. dollar to $1.5219as investors stayed cautious ahead of the UK general election onThursday, with opinion polls still suggesting the result is tooclose to call. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose 0.3 percentto 82.548. (Additional reporting by Kevin Yao in Singapore; editing byStephen Nisbet)             ]]></raw>
