"We don't see this being the start of a major rally butthis is welcome strength in the market and hopefully a welcomeshort-term bottom," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officerof Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York. He said financials were "a very oversold group" that wasdue for a bounce. Greek lawmakers were to begin debating on Monday evening a28 billion euro ($40 billion) package of measures to increasetaxes and cut fiscal spending that is critical to winning a newround of international funding to keep the country afloat.[ID:nLDE75P0BM]. "As long as the Greek Parliament votes 'Yes' this week onan austerity plan, stocks are going to go up," said CaryLeahey, economist and managing director at Decision Economicsin New York. French banks, among the most exposed to the Greek debtcrisis, have reached an outline agreement to roll over holdingsof maturing Greek bonds. French President Nicolas Sarkozyconfirmed the breakthrough on Monday and German bankers voicedtheir interest in the "French model." [ID:nL6E7HR0GU] On Saturday, global banking regulators in Basel agreed thatthe biggest banks globally will need to boost their ratios ofcommon equity to risk-weighted assets by up to 2.5 percentagepoints, less than the 3 percentage points some investors hadfeared.

Global stocks as measured by MSCI  were up0.5 percent for the day. The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European sharesclosed up 0.05 percent at 1,074.67 after hitting its lowestlevel since mid-March on Friday. U.S. Treasuries fell as shrinking worries over a Greekdefault reduced safe-haven demand for U.S. government debt. Asale of two-year notes with a yield of less than half a percentfurther discouraged buyers. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes  were off17/32 in price to yield 2.93 percent, up from Friday's 2.87percent. "It was a relatively weak auction, almost certainly becausetwo-year rates are within shouting distance of the all-timerate lows set in November 2010," RBS head of Treasury strategyWilliam O'Donnell said in a note to clients. EURO UP, OIL WEAK The euro rallied against the U.S. dollar as investorsbecame optimistic the austerity vote will pass in Greece'sparliament and the euro zone member can avoid a default on itsdebt.
