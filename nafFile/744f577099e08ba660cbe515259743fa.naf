<raw><![CDATA[ BRUSSELS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Euro zone retail sales were flatin December despite it traditionally being one of the busiestmonths of the year, figures showed on Wednesday, suggestingconsumer demand remains weak and the economic recovery fragile. On a year-on-year basis, European Union statistics agencyEurostat said retail trade fell 1.6 percent across the16-country euro area in December.  Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percentmonthly increase and a 2.5 percent year-on-year fall. The data suggests consumer demand, normally strong in theChristmas season, is unlikely to have contributed much to anexpected recovery in economic growth in the fourth quarter of2009. Eurostat revised its November retail trade figure to -0.5percent month-on-month from a previous -1.2 percent. The annualindex was revised to -2.0 percent from -4.0 percent. Economists say people are likely to keep spending tightbecause of growing unemployment, which rose to 10 percent in theeuro zone workforce in December, the highest rate since August1998. GDP growth will likely depend on government spending as tensof billions of euros are pumped into the economy to stimulatedemand, and on companies replenishing their inventories. In a breakdown, Eurostat said euro zone retail sales offood, drinks and tobacco increased 0.3 percent month-on-month inDecember while non-food products fell 0.2 percent. Among countries that have reported figures, the biggestmonthly increases in sales were in Austria, France, Spain,Slovenia and Slovakia. In the wider, 27-nation European Union, sales fell 0.1percent on the month and decreased 1.0 percent year-on-year. Gloomy figures for the Baltic republics highlighted thedepth of their economic crisis. In Estonia, Latvia andLithuania, sales fell 16.4 percent, 30.2 percent and 27.2percent respectively on a year-on-year basis. (Reporting by Marcin Grajewski)             ]]></raw>
