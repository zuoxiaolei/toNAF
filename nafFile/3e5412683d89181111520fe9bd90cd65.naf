<raw><![CDATA[ * Audit body recommends parliament review ESM fund payments * MPs want control over future German payments into fund * Lawmakers have consultation right only over EFSF payments * German FinMin to push for same model for ESM funds (Recast, adds quotes from finmin, analysts, lawmakers) By Andreas Rinke BERLIN, April 13 (Reuters) - German lawmakers should have aright of veto over the country's contributions to a permanentfund being set up to bail out fiscally troubled euro zonestates, senior politicians said on Wednesday. The European Stability Mechanism is due to come into forcein 2013 with 80 billion euros in cash reserves meant to assureit holds a triple-A rating. Europe's dominant economy has undertaken to pay 21.7 billionof that into the fund, which will replace the smaller, temporaryEuropean Financial Stability Facility being tapped by bailoutbeneficiaries Ireland and Portugal. The ESM will also be backed by 620 billion euros ofguarantees, increasing the euro zone's potential firepower fordealing with future financial crises and in effect committingmember states to additional contributions if required. Analysts said there was little risk that action by Germanlawmakers would hinder the functioning of the ESM, though it wasclear parliament would press to retain the ability topotentially control the terms of bailouts. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he expectedparliament to approve any funding requests. PARLIAMENTARY RIGHTS Germany's lower parliamentary house, the Bundestag, has theright of consultation over EFSF payments, and the country isembroiled in a debate over whether contributions into the ESMshould face the same level of scrutiny, be waved throughautomatically or require full approval. The issue resurfaced after a warning from the auditors'court led some members of the Bundestag's budget committee todemand that any payments into the ESM beyond the initialcontributions should face a parliamentary vote. "By all means, the German Bundestag (lower house ofparliament) must approve (them)," said Birgit Homburger,parliamentary floor leader of the junior coalition partner, theFree Democrats (FDP). "It is clear that budget rules (requiring parliamentaryapproval for bailout funding) must be adhered to," said MichaelMeister, deputy parliamentary leader of Chancellor AngelaMerkel's Christian Democrat (CDU) party. However, Germany needed to take care "not to create rulesthat bring instability again to financial markets," he added. Schaeuble moved to take the heat out of the debate, tellingparliament at question time he expected authorisation of the ESMfunding agreed by European leaders. "We are very much at the beginning of the consultations... the details must still be negotiated in a treaty that needs theratification of German legislators," he said. He said he would recommend the approval process for ESMpayments follow the model used for the EFSF. Daniel Gros, director of the Centre for European PolicyStudies in Brussels, said parliamentary concerns would be veryunlikely to hinder the successful operation of the ESM.
