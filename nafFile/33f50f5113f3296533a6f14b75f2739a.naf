<raw><![CDATA[ (Repeats late Tuesday story without changes) By Natsuko Waki DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Emerging economies,seen as the big hope for global growth this year, are caught ina tricky dilemma: let inflation rip and hurt stability or raiserates and risk stalling their economies. Policymakers and business leaders at the World EconomicForum starting on Wednesday in Davos will look at ways foremerging economies to keep the engine of growth revving withoutstoking inflation. Developing countries have so far been reluctant to raise thecost of borrowing, as higher interest rates would attract evenmore capital inflows and push up local currencies, hurtingexport competitiveness. Emerging nations are all too aware of their role in keepingthe world economic recovery on track. The International MonetaryFund drove home that point on Tuesday, saying a slowdown inthese economies would deal a serious blow to global growth. Concerns are intensifying that emerging market monetaryauthorities may be behind the curve in tackling inflation. Ifinflation got out of control and aggressive policy measuresbecame necessary, that could send these economies into a hardlanding, damaging the rest of the world. "There's a real risk that being behind the curve inaddressing inflation, inflation takes root and then the secondround effects will be more damaging for these countries and alsofor the world economy," said Michala Marcussen, head of globaleconomics at French investment bank Societe Generale. "That's why if you think about the risks for the globaleconomy today, the risk is more that something nasty comes outof emerging markets than advanced economies." Investors are already becoming nervous about the prospect ofinflation surprises in the emerging markets.  Emerging market stocks, as measured by MSCI , hittwo-week lows earlier this week, underperforming their developedmarket counterparts . According to its updated economic outlook, the IMF expectsemerging economies to grow 6.5 percent in 2011 against a 2.5percent expansion in the developed world. It cited inflation as the key risk for emerging economiesand said tighter monetary policies were needed.  "Many countries are close to potential," IMF head ofresearch Olivier Blanchard told a news conference. "That probably means that in a number of countries monetarypolicy may need to be tightened in order to maintain inflationunder control." -----------------------------------------------------  For a graphic on global inflation rates, click on:  http://r.reuters.com/wuz46r  -----------------------------------------------------  WALKING ON A TIGHT ROPE A flood of cheap money -- created as a result of ultra-easymonetary policy in the developed economies -- is the root of theinflation problems in the emerging world. Fund tracker EPFR estimates emerging market equity and bondfunds attracted almost $150 billion in 2010, compared with $93billion in 2009. The Institute for International Finance expects 2011 equityportfolio flows to emerging markets to ease to $143 billion in2011 from an estimated $186 billion last year, although they arestill more than double the $62 billion annual average of 2005-9. Based on a monetary policy rule developed by U.S. economistJohn Taylor, a central bank whose inflation is above targetshould have positive real rates to tackle price pressures. But real rates in many emerging economies are near zero. For example, Turkey cut its benchmark rate to 6.25 percentin a surprise move last week, raising concerns about thedirection of monetary policy. The central bank has just upgradedits 2011 inflation forecast to 5.9 percent. Emerging central banks do have another policy tool in theirinflation battle: allowing currencies to appreciate gradually. "They should've been more aggressive than they were in thepast. You would think that if their inflation-targetingprogramme becomes bigger in scale, they may give more ground tocurrencies to appreciate," said Michael Dicks, chief economistat Barclays Wealth in London. As part of efforts to quell inflation, China is set to letthe yuan rise further this year. A Reuters poll showed the yuanwould hit 6.3 per dollar by end-2011, a rise of around 5percent, compared with last year's 3.6 percent rise. The Chinese currency has now gained nearly 26 percentagainst the dollar since July 2005. (Editing by Michael Stott)             ]]></raw>
