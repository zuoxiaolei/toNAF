<raw><![CDATA[ * Summers: not argument between "brakes and accelerators" * European policymakers defend austerity policies * ECB's Trichet denies cost-cutting risks stagnation * Germany says doing plenty to support growth (Adds Summers, South Korea's Lee) By Glenn Somerville and Krista Hughes WASHINGTON/BERLIN, June 24 (Reuters) - The top White Houseeconomic advisor said on Thursday world leaders must keep thetentative global recovery on track as Europe headed into thisweekend's G20 summit defending plans for heavy cost-cutting. The United States and some European countries have stresseddifferent priorities for economic policy now that the world isemerging from its worst slump in decades. Lawrence Summers, in an interview with Reuters ahead of theGroup of 20 meeting in Toronto, said governments must work toto avoid the risk of a "protracted stagnation" which couldaggravate fiscal problems. But Summers sought to downplay differences with Europe overthe need to tackle high debts and deficits as part of the wayforward for policymakers. "One important aspect of that focus needs to be...on fiscalsustainability. Just how that's done, just what the pacing is,is something that will inevitably vary from country tocountry," he said. [ID:nN24122604] Top European officials defended austerity plans with GermanChancellor Angela Merkel insisting Berlin would move ahead withits biggest program of fiscal cutbacks since World War Two.  For full coverage                          [ID:nN18322198] Factbox on austerity measures              [ID:nLDE64Q1OF] Timeline on the debt crisis                [ID:nLDE65n0VR] Graphic                     http://link.reuters.com/cew83m Insider TV                  http://link.reuters.com/dux43m ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said itwas wrong to assume budget austerity would lead to stagnation. "The idea that austerity measures could trigger stagnationis incorrect," he told Italian newspaper La Repubblica,describing the German budget plans as "good" and repeatingcalls for more fiscal discipline in the 16-nation euro zone. Merkel, who aims to save 80 billion euros in the next fouryears, said now was the time to impose more financialdiscipline. "We'll enact the measures that we've agreed upon," Merkelsaid in an interview with German ARD television broadcast onThursday. "I believe we should not let up." German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, writing inHandelsblatt newspaper, said he could not understand the"implicit accusation" that Germany was "wrecking the recoverywith austerity measures" because Berlin was doing a lot tostimulate growth. After winning praise for steering the world economy throughthe financial crisis, the G20 countries find themselvesstruggling to keep a unified line on what comes next:supporting still-shaky growth or cutting budget deficits. Markets are jittery about the soaring levels of debt inmany rich countries and the risk of an economic slowdown. Thecost of protecting government debt against default hit a recordhigh for Greece on Thursday and jumped in other peripheralcountries such as Portugal. [ID:nLDE65N0J2] "FRAGILE" RECOVERY The draft version of the Toronto summit communique, datedJune 11 and obtained by Reuters on Wednesday, said the recoverywas "uneven and fragile" and warned against complacency.[ID:nN23177602] "Fiscal challenges in many states are creating marketvolatility, and could seriously threaten the recovery andweaken prospects for long-term growth," it said. President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, which currentlychairs the G20, said that while the global economy wasrecovering, each country must seek to keep recovery on trackwhile developing its own "concrete, reliable exit strategy." "But they also have to consider any subsequent rippleeffects that might spread through neighboring countries," Leetold Toronto's Globe and Mail newspaper. The United States has warned against withdrawing supporttoo soon, mindful of when the government slammed the brakes onspending in the 1930s, prolonging the Great Depression. But Summers took a softer line on Thursday, dismissing talkthat the G20 leaders would clash over whether to push forfiscal prudence or sustaining growth. "I am sure there are people who will try to divert (the G20leaders) into an argument about the brakes versus theaccelerators but I have never seen a car with only a brake oran accelerator," Summers said. "One of the first things they taught me...in my driver's edcourse was that, never, ever could you fail to look down theroad even as you are looking at what is right in front ofyou." The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday acknowledged afaltering pace of U.S. economic recovery as it renewed its vowto hold benchmark interest rates exceptionally low for anextended period. But it stuck to its expectation that theeconomy will continue to gradually improve.  [ID:nLDE65N01S] BACKLASH AND BUDGET CUTS In Europe, a market backlash against countries seen to bedragging their feet on cutting debt and deficits has sparkedbudget cutbacks as governments try to rein in spending. French unions staged a nationwide strike on Thursday overplans to reform the pension system following similar protestsin Spain and Greece, where ministers were due to meet onThursday to discuss their own pension reforms. [ID:nLDE65N0M1 Spanish Economy Minister Elena Salgado said she wasconfident the minority government's budget would pass thenational parliament in September, when unions have alsoscheduled a general strike.  [ID:nLDE65N0L9] G20 leaders must also forge consensus on how to harmonisefinancial regulatory reforms and ECB chief Trichet said he wasconfident the G20 was on the right track. The G20 summit takes place in Toronto on Saturday andSunday. The group includes the world's biggest economies andcovers two-thirds of the world's population. It will be preceded by a meeting of the G8, composed ofBritain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and theUnited States.
