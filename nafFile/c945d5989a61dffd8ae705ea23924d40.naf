<raw><![CDATA[ By Simon Rabinovitch and Jason Subler BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Feb 22 (Reuters) - A few months afterBeijing revalued the yuan by 2.1 percent in July 2005, PremierWen Jiabao said, "there will be no more surprises". But now economists are again discussing the possibility ofa one-off appreciation because China's inflation is picking upand its exports are recovering. The government has in effect re-pegged the yuan at about6.83 to the dollar to cushion its exporters and shore upfinancial stability since mid-2008 when the global financialcrisis worsened. In the process, it has grown increasinglyhostile to foreign criticism of its controversial currencypolicy. China looks set to stay the course on the de facto peg fora while yet, but change is likely to come later this year. Hereis a look at various scenarios of what might happen. For a graphic contrasting the yuan/dollar spot rate andone-year non-deliverable forwards, see: http://link.reuters.com/zab42j DE FACTO PEG MAINTAINED * Probability: Likely into the second quarter If the Chinese export lobby gets its way, the yuan willstay locked in place until external demand recovers strongly.The commerce ministry has repeatedly insisted that a stableyuan has benefited both China and the world during the globalfinancial crisis. It again voiced this opinion on Monday.[ID:nTOE61L01O] Double-digit annual growth in exports is all but assured incoming months due to a low base of comparison in early 2009,but policymakers will be looking at month-on-month numbers formore solid evidence of recovery. Sequential growth momentumwent into reverse in January, with exports down 16 percent fromDecember. RESUMPTION OF GRADUAL APPRECIATION * Probability: Likely over the full year Many analysts expect Beijing to let the yuan startstrengthening again sometime in the next few months, givengrowing inflationary pressures and the nascent recovery inexports, leaving it roughly 3-5 percent stronger a year fromnow. Offshore yuan forwards are currently pricing in 2.7 percentappreciation against the dollar over the next year, while a Reuters poll conducted last monthcentred on a 3 percent rise by the end of this year.[ID:nTOE60603X] However, the exact form of such a gradual climb is subjectto much debate. While the central bank may be most likely to resume gradualappreciation quietly, some economists say it could start with asmall revaluation, as in July 2005, and could widen the bandwithin which the yuan may rise or fall on any given day. Versusthe dollar, that band is now plus or minus 0.5 percent. Such a move could be pushed back slightly by politicalconsiderations, as Beijing seeks to avoid giving the impressionthat it is yielding to pressure from the United States. Any such upward drift in the yuan would probably supportAsian currencies, from the Singapore dollar  to theJapanese yen , that are looked to as yuan proxies. The impact on commodities markets and commodities-linkedcurrencies is more difficult to predict, as such a move wouldmake imports cheaper but could also be seen as a tighteningmeasure that would temper Chinese growth in the medium term. NEW EXCHANGE RATE REGIME * Probability: Less likely but garnering attention Economists have suggested that China would benefit from anew model for determining the yuan's exchange rate. Although the exchange rate is theoretically set at presentwith reference to a basket of currencies, it has in practicebeen overwhelmingly centred on the dollar. The yuan rose nearly20 percent in a roughly straight line against the U.S. currencyfrom mid-2005 to mid-2008, giving speculators a one-way bet. Ting Lu, an economist with Merrill Lynch, has said thatBeijing should follow Singapore's lead in targetting a basketof currencies, keeping the basket's composition a secret so asto create uncertainty about when the central bank mightintervene. Jun Ma, an economist with Deutshe Bank, advocates a"flexible crawling peg against a basket" that would generateuncertainty, as in the Singaporean case, but with daily andmonthly volatility limits against the dollar to avoid hurtingcompanies. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, atop government think-tank, have suggested a policy of making itclear the yuan will appreciate by 3-5 percent each year, but inan unpredictable pattern so speculators are wrong-footed. BIG ONE-TIME REVALUATION * Probability: Unlikely A substantial one-time revaluation would fly in the face ofBeijing's promised policy continuity and might appear todomestic critics as if the government was caving in to foreignpressure. Moreover, given China's style of consensual decisionmaking, any major policy shift would require agreement fromhard-liners opposed to appreciation, limiting the scope for theyuan's rise. Still, some market heavyweights have begun to predict asizeable one-off revaluation. The chief economist at Goldman Sachs said earlier thismonth that Beijing could be about to let the yuan strengthen byas much as 5 percent, while Societe Generale said in a note onMonday it expected a revaluation of 5 to 10 percent aroundApril or May. A big enough revaluation would, in theory, deter hot moneyinflows by damping expectations of further major gains. But ifit was deemed insufficient, investors might still pile intoChinese assets on expectations the yuan would have to climbfurther. Conversely, if the adjustment was big enough to deterspeculators, it might batter the very exporters that Beijinghas tried so hard to support. A major yuan revaluation could lead to sharp initial gainsfor other Asian currencies such as the yen and Australiandollar , which tend to have high correlations withChinese growth. But the sharper the move, the greater the possibility thatit would also set off worries about the world's third-largesteconomy slowing as a result of the impact on exporters, meaningequity and commodity markets might react negatively. Shares of companies geared towards Chinese finalconsumption, from luxury goods retailers to automakers, mightrally on the hope that cheaper imports would drive China'sdemand.
