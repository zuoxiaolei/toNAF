<raw><![CDATA[European markets opened down on Monday amid lingering fears over U.S. President Barack Obama’s proposals to curb risk-taking by financial institutions.  France’s CAC 40 was down 0.33%; Germany's DAX was down 0.64%; the EURO STOXX 50 was down 0.53%; and Britain's FTSE 100 slipped 0.11%.
