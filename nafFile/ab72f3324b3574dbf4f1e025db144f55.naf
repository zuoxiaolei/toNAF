<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro retreats from 1-mth high vs dlr, Aussie trims gains * Yuan makes minimal headway after China pledges freer moves * Euro short-covering rally loses steam  By Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, June 22 (Reuters) - The euro retreated from aone-month high against the dollar on Tuesday, tracking apullback in the yuan a day after China pledged to allow itscurrency to trade more freely. Upward momentum seen on Monday in the euro and higher-riskcurrencies including the Australian dollar petered out asinvestors acknowledged that a more flexible yuan policy wouldnot lead to a sharp appreciation in the currency. The yuan's daily mid-point was set at 6.7980 per dollar onTuesday, the highest since its July 2005 revaluation but theChinese currency relinquished gains as big, state-owned banksheavily bought dollars. Looser yuan controls are seen as positive for the globaleconomy as they will help address global imbalances and coolChinese inflation risks. China's central bank has indicated itwould let the yuan rise further after the previous day's surge. But analysts said the view the yuan's gains would be subtleprompted investors to pause the euro's short-covering rally inthe wake of the single currency's tumble to a four-year lowagainst the dollar earlier this month. "A moderate appreciation of the yuan will not change China'scurrent account situation and it won't imply the end of globalimbalances," said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency strategist atCommerzbank in Frankfurt. "Therefore there is no reason for a significant impact onthe euro/dollar or dollar/yen," he said. "It would have to bequite a large revaluation to have a lasting impact on themajors." Analysts said a ratings downgrade of French bank BNP Paribasby Fitch and S&P's announcement it was raising its estimates forloan losses for Spain's banking sector on Monday also helpedweigh down the euro. By 0726 GMT, the euro traded at $1.2318, unchanged on theday after hitting the day's low of $1.2285. The single currencypulled back from $1.2490 hit on Monday, its strongest since May24, after failing to break into the $1.25 region. Near-term support was seen at $1.2253, a 38.2 percentFibonacci retracement of the rise from a four-year low of$1.1875 on June 7 to Monday's high. The euro barely reacted to the German Ifo index, whichshowed a higher-than-expected reading of the business climateand current conditions, while the expectations index wasslightly weaker than forecast. The Australian dollar traded 0.4 percent higher at $0.8787,but stayed off $0.8860 hit on Monday, its strongest sincemid-May.  The commodity-linked Australian unit is seen benefiting froma stronger yuan, in part as it may help to boost demand for thenatural resources China needs to further develop its economy. The dollar index was flat at 85.885, having reversed a fallto a one-month low on Monday. Market participants said thissuggested more gains for the greenback in the near term. Thedollar was up 0.3 percent at 90.77 yen. (Editing by Mike Peacock)             ]]></raw>
