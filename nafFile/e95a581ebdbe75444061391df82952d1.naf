<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro erased losses against the U.S. dollar on Monday, rising to a fresh four-month high as risk sentiment remained supported by news of easing measures by the Federal Reserve, although concerns over Spain's debt woes limited gains.EUR/USD pulled away from 1.3084, the daily low, to hit 1.3142 during U.S. morning trade, adding 0.10%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.2985, the low of September 14 and resistance at 1.3241, the high of May 2.Risk sentiment was boosted after the Fed announced last week that it would buy USD40 billion of mortgage-backed securities every month and would keep buying them until the job market improves. The bank also said it expects to keep short-term interest rates at record low levels through at least mid-2015, six months longer than previously anticipated.But the euro's gains were limited as Spain's government faced protests over the weekend against public spending cuts, even as Madrid told its European partners that its next steps to overhaul the economy would avoid further cuts in public spending. Earlier Monday, European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny reminded Spain that it needs to apply for a rescue package to qualify for the central bankâ€™s bond-buying program, while Reuters reported that Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is set to unveil a further economic reform package late September.Concerns over the worsening of the euro zone's debt crisis also resurfaced after the ECB said that its current account fell to EUR9.7 billion in July, from EUR14.3 billion the previous month. Analysts had expected the bank's current account to decline to EUR10 billion in July.A separate report showed that the euro zone's trade surplus narrowed unexpectedly to EUR7.9 billion in July from EUR9.3 billion the previous month.Elsewhere, the euro was steady against the pound with EUR/GBP easing 0.06%, to hit 0.8091.Also Monday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that its index of manufacturing activity fell unexpectedly to minus 10.4 in September, from a reading of 5.8 the previous month.Analysts had expected the index to decline to improve to minus 2 in September.             ]]></raw>
