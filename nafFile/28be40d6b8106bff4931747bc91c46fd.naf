<raw><![CDATA[ * Greek T-bill auction well covered but with high yield * Euro reverses gains vs dlr, hits session low * Analysts say Greece still has tough times ahead   (Adds details, update prices) By Neal Armstrong LONDON, April 13 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a session lowversus the dollar on Tuesday after results of a Greek Treasurybill auction showed the market still demanded a high premium tohold Greek assets. Greece easily sold its allocation of 6 and 12-month T-Bills,raising 1.56 billion euros with the inclusion of non-competitivebids, but at a yield which was costly for the debt-ladencountry. The euro rose briefly in the immediate aftermath of theauction as traders reacted to a strong bid to cover ratio. However, analysts said attention then shifted to the yieldGreece had to pay -- more than double those paid at auctions inJanuary of bills with similar maturities. "The higher yield confirmed the high risk premium demandedfor Greek assets and that has put the euro bears in a strongerposition," said Audrey Childe-Freeman, currency analyst at BrownBrothers Harriman. "The euro was already showing signs of fatigue," she said. On Monday, the euro climbed to a near one-month high of$1.3691 after euro zone finance ministers agreed at the weekendon a financial aid package for Greece, before paring gains asinvestors sought clarification about the plan. At 1132 GMT, the euro traded at $1.3587, recovering from asession low of $1.3556. Traders said a Swiss bank bought eurosfor an option at $1.36 expiring later in the day. "(The auction) does not really change the underlyingposition that Greece has very tough times ahead, it's goingthrough a deep recession and that's going to lead the debt toGDP ratio to surge higher," said Ben May at Capital Economics. Despite concerns about Greece, the euro was supported from atechnical perspective. Technical analysts at UBS said clearanceof $1.3591 would open the door to $1.3816, a level last hit inmid-March. Versus the yen, the euro slipped 0.2 percent at 126.45 yen.It slipped as low 125.71 yen in earlier trade  as investorcaution crept in regarding the Greek aid plan. The yen was pressured earlier by a draft from a group ofJapanese ruling party lawmakers which suggested the dollarshould be kept around 120 yen.. The dollar hit the day's high of 93.42 yen on the proposal,before retreating to 93.00 yen, down 0.3 percent on the day.  PRICE FORECAST The dollar hovered above a two-week low hit against the yenin Asia as stocks in the region slipped. Some said a report thatthe Bank of Japan may slightly revise up its consumer priceforecast for the next fiscal year also helped the yen. BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said annual consumer pricefalls were expected to narrow as the output gap shrinks but thatthe central bank did not rule out any option. The yen remained sensitive to market expectations on theChinese yuan. Chinese President Hu Jintao told U.S. PresidentBarack Obama Beijing would "firmly stick" to its own path forreforming the yuan's exchange rate, the official Xinhua newsagency said.    Hu added the yuan's gains would neither balance Sino-U.Strade, nor solve the U.S. unemployment problem. The dollar was trading flat versus a basket of currencies at 80.60.(Additional reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by NigelStephenson)             ]]></raw>
