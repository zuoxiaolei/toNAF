<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro broadly higher, short squeeze continues * Fears of currency intervention grow * Australian dollar jumps but still sharply down on week (Adds comment, updates prices, changes byline) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, May 21 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Friday,heading for its first weekly gain versus the U.S. dollar in sixweeks as investors who had bet on the currency's fall bought itback on fears of currency intervention. The Australian dollar jumped on speculation Australia'scentral bank may step in to support the currency. The Aussiedollar is on track for its its biggest weekly drop since 2008,hammered by worries the euro zone debt crisis could hinder aglobal economic recovery. The euro gained for a third straight session after Germanlawmakers approved their country's contribution to a 750billion euro bailout package, and as European finance ministersmet in Brussels to discuss changes to the way the 27-nationbloc manage public finances. "With the immense amount of short positions in the marketand EU leaders rushing to put together a lasting remedy, theeuro has certainly found its footing," said Andrew Wilkinson,senior analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich,Connecticut. "There has also been some market rumors that central bankswould intervene, which in my mind is an unlikely event.However, the very suggestion is enough to make investors parepositions," he added. In afternoon trading in New York, the euro traded 0.9percent higher at $1.2575, after climbing as high as $1.2673 onelectronic trading platform EBS. It is poised to end the week1.8 percent higher against the dollar, following five weeks oflosses. The euro zone single currency tumbled to a four-year low of$1.2143 on EBS on Wednesday after Germany banned naked shortselling in some securities, fueling speculation about otherpossible market regulations. The Australian dollar rose 1.5 percent against the U.S.dollar to $0.8276, pulling back from its lowest level sinceJuly 2009 hit on Thursday and on track for a weekly loss of 6.6percent. It was also up 3.3 percent against the yen. "The aussie/yen is a good proxy for the risk trade and theyen has done well on the move away from risk in Europe," saidDavid Kupersmith, head trader at Third Wave Global Investors, aglobal macro hedge fund in Greenwich, Connecticut. "It hasnothing to do with the economic situation in Australia or Japanthough there are signs Australia is slowing down." EURO BOTTOMS? Germany's parliament approved a bill to allow Berlin tocontribute to the European rescue aid for Greece and other eurozone nations plagued by debt problems. Merkel said on Fridaythe vote sends a strong signal on "European stabilityculture." The euro has fallen roughly 5.5 percent against the dollarthis month. Its steep decline has cranked up speculationEuropean officials may be concerned about its level. It also got a boost after European Central Bank PresidentJean-Claude Trichet said on Friday the euro was not in dangerand was a credible currency. "It's very possible that we've seen a medium-term low. Wecould be back at $1.30 this time next week," InteractiveBrokers Group's Wilkinson said, referring to the euro/dollar. Against the Swiss franc, the euro traded 0.5 percent higherat 1.4434, having recovered sharply from a slide to an all-timelow around 1.3995 francs earlier in the week. Concerns harsh fiscal tightening in Europe may hinderglobal growth have heightened fears about risk and prompted arush to square positions across asset classes this week. "Risk aversion has risen so rapidly that in order toprotect their books, investors are just closing positions andrepatriating capital," said Carl Hammer, currency strategist atSEB in Stockholm, adding: "It's a snowball effect." The U.S. dollar rose 0.3 percent to 89.79 yen, while itfell 0.8 percent to C$1.0618.             ]]></raw>
