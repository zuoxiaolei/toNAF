<raw><![CDATA[ * Q1 growth slower than Q4 2010's 6.9 pct * Consumption, transport, communications drive Q1 growth * Inflation slowed for 3rd month in April, cbank seen onhold (Updates with details)	 By Neil Chatterjee and Aditya Suharmoko	 JAKARTA, May 5 (Reuters) - Indonesia's economy, the biggestin Southeast Asia, expanded a strong 6.5 percent in the firstquarter from a year ago, in line with expectations and driven byinvestment and emerging middle class consumers.	 The pace of growth in gross domestic product slowed from theprevious quarter, when it was its fastest in at least six years.	 The moderation should give the central bank room to leaveinterest rates on hold again when it meets next week afterpolicymakers have allowed the Indonesian currency, the rupiah,to rise 5 percent in 2011 to a 7-year high to keep a lid oninflation.	 Annual inflation slowed to a six-month low in April, thoughmost analysts see core inflation picking up further, which mayprompt Bank Indonesia to raise the benchmark rate in comingmonths from 6.75 percent currently.	 "There is little sign here that the economy is becomingoverheated... The central bank will be in no hurry to move againafter CPI fell for three months running," said GeorgeWorthington, economist at IFR Markets, a unit of ThomsonReuters, in Sydney.	  The economy appeared to be on track to meet government andanalyst forecasts for a 6.4 percent expansion in 2011, thethird-highest in Asia after China and India. Solid growth andother factors have helped push stocks to a record high this weekand attract investors to a global bond issue.	 "The vital signs for the Indonesian economy are itsstrongest in the last decade and the fundamentals areimproving," said Finance Minister Agus Martowardojo at an AsianDevelopment Bank forum in Hanoi on Thursday.	 The minister said he is confident inflation can be keptwithin the government's target this year and is comfortable thatexporters can cope with the stronger rupiah .	 Indonesia's central bank has said it maintains a tighteningstance to manage inflation, after a surprise 25 basis pointsrate rise in February to calm worried markets, though it is alsofocused on spurring growth. The rate rise was its only movesince slashing rates during the financial crisis, and analystssee up to 75 bps of further tightening this year.	 Foreign portfolio investors, who offloaded Indonesian assetsearlier this year on concerns about the central bank's abilityto control inflation, have resumed buying, with foreign bondownership at record levels. Indonesia's credit rating is onenotch below a coveted investment grade that would put it on apar with BRIC nations such as China. 	  RISING INCOMES	 The statistics bureau said growth, which was 6.9 percent inthe fourth quarter of 2010, was led in the first quarter by thetelecommunications and transport sectors. These grew 13.8percent, while trade, hotel and restaurants rose 7.9 percent.	 Indonesia's main vehicle seller Astra saw firstquarter profits jump 43 percent, reflecting car sales that wereup around 30 percent in a buoyant consumer market that hasattracted investment interest this year from Japan's Daihatsu and China's BYD .	 Total investment grew 27 percent in the first quarter from ayear ago. China, seeking resources from the world's largestthermal coal and palm oil exporter, said last week it willprovide Indonesia with $9 billion in loans for infrastructure.	 While commuters in the capital are used to waiting, stuck intraffic during tropical downpours, queues for Unilever's new Magnum Cafe -- the only one in the world -- canalso last three hours as rising disposable incomes enable morepeople to splash out on luxury ice-creams.	 "Household consumption, as the main foundation ofIndonesia's economy, is good. We have just got out from a globalrecession, and this means that investment is playing a key roleagain, and can give a multiplier effect to Indonesia's economy,"said Eric Sugandi, economist at Standard Chartered in Jakarta.	 Unemployment in February dropped to 8.1 million people or6.8 percent of Indonesia's labour force, from 7.4 percent a yearago, the statistics bureau said.	 Improvements in commodity-driven infrastructure outside themain island of Java are giving a boost to transport,construction, and banks. Top lender Mandiri saw firstquarter profit surge 89 percent, as overall growth in theeconomy's financial and real estate sectors quickened to 7.3percent.	 Indonesia aims to reach annual growth of over 7 percent by2014, but poor infrastructure, from bad roads to electricityblackouts, remains an obstacle and the government is seeking tooverhaul it with $100 billion of private investment.
