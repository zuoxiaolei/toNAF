<raw><![CDATA[ * Investors unwind safe-haven positions * Euro supported by Asia demand, risk appetite * U.S. dollar weaker across the board (Recasts; updates prices, adds quotes, changes byline) By Julie Haviv NEW YORK, Feb 8 (Reuters)  - An appetite for riskiercurrencies strongly favored the euro versus the U.S. dollar andSwiss franc on Tuesday, with more gains seen as slightly calmerheadlines from the Middle East reduced the appeal of safe-havencurrencies. The euro gained after underperforming for most of the pastweek, lifted by demand from Asian central banks and buyingagainst the Australian dollar after a Chinese interest ratehike fueled concerns over that country's economic growth anddemand for commodities. "Safe-haven currencies fared well during the height of thetensions in Egypt last week, but as the headlines subsidesomewhat investors are unwinding some of those positions inexchange for riskier currencies," said Greg Anderson, G10strategist at CitiFX in New York. Weak demand for a U.S. Treasury bond sale had a slightnegative impact on the dollar, he said. U.S. Treasury debt prices touched session lows in earlyafternoon trading after weaker-than-expected results at a $32billion auction of three-year government debt. The note sale isthe first leg of this week's $72 billion February refunding. Traders said central bank buying of yen and fiscal year-endrepatriation in Japan have supported the yen against the dollardespite a surge in U.S. yields in recent weeks. The U.S. dollar struggled against a major currency basket,slipping 0.1 percent to 77.918  and lost 0.1 percentagainst the yen  to 82.21. "Over the next couple of weeks the euro will likely staywithin a range and not go below $1.3509 or above $1.3862,"Anderson said. The euro rose above key resistance at $1.3680, a high onelectronic trading platform EBS last Friday. If euro/dollarmanages to extend beyond $1.3680, analysts see the nextresistance level at $1.3767, the Feb. 2 low. The euro's strength against the dollar could prove to betemporary, with comments from European Central Bank PresidentJean-Claude Trichet last week sharply diminishing expectationsof a near-term European Central Bank rate hike. The euro  gained 0.4 percent versus the greenbackto $1.3646 as investors booked profits on long dollar positionstaken in the last four days. Other euro-linked assets were also higher. TheCurrencyShares Euro Trust , an exchange-traded fund listedon the Chicago Board Options Exchange, was up 0.9 percent at$136.28. The ETF holds euro on-demand deposits ineuro-denominated bank accounts. The euro also benefited from buying against the Aussiedollar, traders said, after a Chinese rate increase on Tuesday.It had fallen significantly versus the Australian currency thelast two years. China's central bank raised its benchmark one-year depositrate by 25 basis points to 3 percent, its second increase injust over a month, intensifying its fight against stubbornlyhigh inflation. For details, see [ID:nTOE706030] The Aussie dollar is the currency most sensitive to Chineseinterest rate policy as Australia is China's biggest supplierof commodities. The decline in implied volatility, a measure of risksentiment in major currencies, has also spurred buying ofriskier currencies. The one-month implied volatility oneuro/dollar fell to its lowest in more than five months onTuesday, at 10.59 percent . Risky trades thrive in an environment of low volatility. The Australian dollar  initially fell against theU.S. dollar after the Chinese rate hike but recovered in NewYork trading to move up 0.3 percent at US$1.0159. Near-termsupport is seen at $1.0083, last Friday's low. MacNeil Curry, chief rates & currencies technicalstrategist, said in a BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research reportthst since 2000, the AUD/USD shows a very strong propensity torally at the start of the Lunar New Year. "A break of 1.0185/1.0260 would confirm a return to trend,targeting 1.06/1.10," he said. "Given our bearish EUR view,this should also result in a weaker EUR/AUD, with the currentbounce an opportunity to get short."
