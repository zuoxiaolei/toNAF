<raw><![CDATA[ * GDP growth seen at +0.8 pct in 08/09, +0.5 pct 09/10 * Inflation seen slowing to 1.9 pct in 2009/10 * Argues for rates to stay low for some time to come By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, July 15 (Reuters) - Australia should escape therecession engulfing much of the developed world thanks toaggressive stimulus and abundant resources, though growth islikely to be anaemic at best for the coming year or so. Still, subpar growth means inflation should slow and offerplenty of room for more rate cuts if needed, a luxury in aworld where many central banks are already near the zero bound. Analysts polled by Reuters thought gross domestic product(GDP) grew by 0.8 percent on average over the 12 months toJune, a stalwart performance given the worst global recessionsince the 1930s. "The big picture remains that aggressive easings ofmonetary and fiscal policy have stabilised the economy - atleast for now - faster than almost anyone dared hope," saidRory Robertson, interest rate strategist at Macquarie inSydney. The Labor government has spent or pledged over A$52 billion($41 billion) in tax breaks and infrastructure projects, whilethe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its key cash rate by425 basis points to a record low of 3 percent. Such largesse has provided crucial support to householdconsumption and helped offset a slump in business investment. Yet new headwinds lie ahead, particularly the drag on tradefrom huge falls in prices for iron ore and coal, Australia'stwo largest exports. That was why analysts expected the country's currentaccount deficit to widen to around A$52 billion in 2009/10,from an estimated A$31 billion in 2008/09. For details of the poll click on. It was also a major reason they forecast GDP growth of just0.5 percent over 2009/10, well below the long-term trend ofaround 3.5 percent. Much would depend on how the labour market fared and, sofar, it has held up far better than almost anyone expected. So far this year, total employment here has fallen by amodest 39,000, while U.S. payrolls were down by 3.4 million.The unemployment rate had risen to a six-year high of 5.8percent, but that compared to 9.5 percent in the United Sates. Warren Hogan, head of Australian economics at ANZ, saidfirms were clearly hoarding labour for longer in this downturnin anticipation of a recovery in the broader economy. "But with hours worked and indicators of new labour demandalready at recessionary levels, we doubt that labour hoardingcan continue without a sustained improvement in underlyingdemand," warned Hogan. "With direct fiscal stimulus likely to fade over the monthsahead, the risk of a broader downturn in the labour marketremains." At least the slowdown in the economy has tamed Australia'sinflation troubles, with consumer price growth seen ebbing to1.9 percent in 2009/10, from 3.1 percent in 2008/09. That wouldbe below the floor of the RBA's 2 to 3 percent target band,allowing it to keep monetary policy exceptionally loose.  "Global excess capacity is staggering, while locally,Australian inflation is set to print close to 1 percent on theyear, the lowest rate in a decade," said Annette Beacher,senior strategist at TD Securities." "Inflation will undershoot the bottom of the RBA targetuntil mid-2010, so we remain comfortable with the view that theRBA is in no hurry to remove the stimulus in the economy."
