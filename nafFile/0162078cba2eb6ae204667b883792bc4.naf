A number above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. HSBC said the reading was the lowest in 10 months. China is Australia’s largest trading partner.The Aussie was also sharply lower against the yen, with AUD/JPY falling 0.83% to hit 86.36.On Sunday, Australia’s Treasurer, Wayne Swan said the new managing director of the International Monetary Fund should be picked on “merit” and that the convention of selecting only Europeans for the post was outdated.             ]]></raw>
