<raw><![CDATA[ (Fixes typo in paragraph 2)	 * Euro falls vs dollar after Franco-German talks disappoint * U.S. output up but global slowdown remains major worry * Dell slashes sales forecast, weighs on Asia tech firms * Hong Kong index up 1.3 percent, Nikkei down 0.4 percent By Daniel Magnowski	 SINGAPORE, Aug 17 (Reuters) - The euro wobbled on Wednesdayafter French and German leaders failed to deliver a solution tothe euro zone debt crisis and restore confidence after a globalmarket rout, while Japanese shares fell, dragged down mainly byhi-tech.	 European shares were expected to fall as much as 0.8 percentwhen markets open.	 Electronics stocks were weak across Asia after computermaker Dell slashed its 2012 sales forecast late onTuesday, a deeply bearish signal not only for the shaky state of global demand but for other hi-tech manufacturers, many ofwhich are listed in Tokyo, Seoul and Taipei. 	 Japan's Nikkei fall 1 percent, but then recovered tobe 0.4 percent down. Bellwether tech exporter Sony sliding 2.7 percent after it cut the price of its Playstation 3gaming console to boost sales.	 In South Korea, LG Electronics tumbled 4.5percent, though the benchmark KOSPI stock index was up1.1 percent.	 Adding to the cautious mood in Asia, S&P stock futures fell almost half a percent in early trade, extendinglosses on Wall Street overnight, before levelling off by 0500GMT. 	 Roland Randall, senior strategist at TD Securities inSingapore said global markets were at the moment largely drivenby fundamentals, but still expected more policy initiativesafter the inconclusive Franco-German summit.	 "This is not panicking any more, it's just investors beingdisappointed relative to expectations on these two fronts,economic activity and evidence of central banks' andpoliticians' efforts," he said.	 The euro fell to $1.4407 from Tuesday'ssession high of around $1.4470, as traders expected moredownward pressure once markets in Europe open later in the day. 	 A hotly anticipated meeting between French President NicolasSarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday fellshort of producing a plan of dramatic action to tackle the eurozone's debt crisis, an outcome many market watchers hadanticipated. 	 While long-term deficit reduction has become a pressingproblem for many developed economies, many investors fear thatcalls for immediate spending cuts in many euro zone countriesand the United States could retard global growth further.	 Germany reported on Tuesday that its economy came close tostalling in the second quarter, though other data showed U.S.industrial output rose at its fastest pace in seven months inJuly, perhaps indicating the economy started the second half ofthe year on better footing than many analysts had feared.  ASIAN DEMAND	 Still, many fund managers see Asian markets as morepromising investment targets than the United States and Europe.	 "Asia is not immune to the developed world woes, as theregion remains a key exporter," said a survey of investmentmanagers published on Wednesday by Singapore-based RussellInvestments.	 "However, the domestic story is becoming more and morepowerful as countries look inward to drive future growth."	 MSCI's broadest index of non-Japanese Asia Pacific shares was up 0.9 percent, supported by gains in HongKong, Australia and Thailand.	 The index has lost around 10 percent since the start of theyear, much of it in recent weeks, as sovereign debt problems inEurope and the United States as well as fears that the U.S.could slide back into recession prompted investors to sellequities and other riskier assets in both emerging and developedmarkets. 	 Shares in Hong Kong were up 1.3 percent,boosted by a speech by Chinese Vice-Premier Li Keqiang in whichhe promised to open more sectors for investment from Hong Kong,while a rise in Australia's main index was tempered byglobal concerns.		 DOLLAR    	 The dollar index against major currencies was flat at0500 GMT. Against the yen, the dollar traded around 76.67 , down from more than 80 yen earlier in August. 	 Gold , attractive to some investors as a refuge fromturmoil in currencies, bonds and shares, is one of thebest-performing assets this year. It traded at $1,784.44 perounce on Wednesday, little changed from the previous sessionaround $30 below the peak it touched last week. 	 U.S. crude oil futures  rebounded 62 cents to $87.10per barrel after sliding on Tuesday on worries that flaggingglobal growth will dampen energy demand.
