<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher against its Canadian counterpart on Friday, after the relatively positive economic reports from the U.S. and Canada, while investors awaited the results of Spanish bank stress tests later in the day.  USD/CAD hit 0.9821 during European afternoon trade, the daily high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.9815, easing up 0.09%.  The pair was likely to find support at 0.9757, the low of September 25 and resistance a0.9854, Thursday's high. Official data earlier showed that Canada's gross domestic product rose to a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in July, from 0.1% the previous month whose figure was revised down from 0.2%, in line with expectations. Meanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis said that personal spending rose in line with expectations in August, ticking up 0.5% after a 0.4% increase the previous month. The data came after the Spanish government announced on Thursday a crisis budget for 2013, based mostly on spending cuts, in what many analysts see as an effort to pre-empt the likely conditions of an international bailout.  Ministry budgets were slashed by 8.9% for next year and public sector wages frozen for a third year as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy battles to trim one of the euro zone's biggest deficits.   Investors remained cautious however, as the results of Spanish bank stress tests were due later Friday. In addition, ratings agency Moodyâ€™s was expected to complete a ratings review on Spain.   Elsewhere, the loonie was lower against the euro with EUR/CAD adding 0.15%, to hit 1.2682.   Later in the day, the U.S. was to release an index of business activity in the Chicago area, while the University of Michigan was to publish revised data on consumer sentiment and inflation expectations.              ]]></raw>
