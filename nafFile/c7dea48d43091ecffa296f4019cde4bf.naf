<raw><![CDATA[ * Aussie, kiwi gain on rate hike prospects after jobs, RBNZ * Euro edges up vs dlr but Greece, Spain worries still weigh * Kiwi gains 1.3 pct vs dollar; BoE policy decision 1200 GMT * SNB keeps FX intervention threat  By Jessica Mortimer LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The Australian and New Zealanddollars rose sharply on Thursday on growing expectations ofhigher interest rates, while concerns over fiscal health inGreece and Spain kept the euro weak versus the dollar. Strong Australian jobs data fuelled anticipation that rateswill rise further in Australia and the Reserve Bank of NewZealand signalled its rates may rise sooner than thought. The euro steadied against the dollar, close to lows hit onWednesday, as sentiment towards the currency stayed negativeafter ratings agencies highlighted the troubles facing some eurozone countries. Standard & Poor's cut Spain's credit outlook to negative onWednesday after Fitch had downgraded Greece's credit rating,sparking concerns about selected sovereign debt. "The euro has probably taken a bit of a hit from theseinternal problems in the euro zone," said Johan Javeus, currencystrategist at SEB in Stockholm. He said these problems may be sparking renewed concernsamong some non-European investors about the potential for theeuro zone to break up, although most still see this as extremelyunlikely. Speaking on Thursday, ECB Governing Council member EwaldNowotny said the current worries about Greece's finances wouldnot split the euro zone By 1123 GMT, the euro was steady against the dollar at$1.4728, not far from a low of $1.4667 hit on Tuesday accordingto Reuters data, its weakest since early November. Traders said the euro was likely to see support above its100-day moving average around $1.4630. Gains on equity marketsalso helped the euro off its lows. European shares were up 0.8percent. Any gains for the euro, however, were small in comparison tothose made by the Australian and New Zealand dollars. This prompted some analysts to speculate that the marketcould be switching from the recent trend of trading on risksentiment, which has seen the euro tend to gain in tandem withhigher-yielding currencies like the Australian dollar. "Interest rates are becoming a more important factor and themarket is looking more at fundamentals now," said You-Na Park,Commerzbank analyst in Frankfurt. The Australian dollar rose 0.8 percent against the dollar to$0.9158, while the New Zealand dollar gained 1.2 percent to$0.7272, hitting its highest in a week, with both bolstered byexpectations interest rates will rise. BOE EYED Sterling rose 0.3 percent against the dollar to $1.6316while the euro fell 0.3 percent to 90.26 pence, with sometraders citing UK corporate buying of sterling. Investors awaited a Bank of England interest rate decisionat 1200 GMT. It is expected to hold rates at 0.5 percent andleave its quantitative easing target unchanged. Any impact onsterling is expected to be minimal. The Swiss franc dipped briefly after the Swiss National Bankheld interest rates steady and stuck to its pledge to fight anappreciation of the franc decisively. This was tempered, however, as the bank dropped its offer tobuy corporate bonds, the first signs it was easing drasticstimulus measures, and as SNB chairman Jean-Pierre Roth said thefranc had stayed stable versus the euro. The euro briefly rose to a session high around 1.5131 francs before dipping back down to around 1.5106, little changed onthe day. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against acurrency basket, was steady at 76.007 while the dollar gained0.6 percent against the yen to 88.41 yen.(Reporting by Jessica Mortimer)             ]]></raw>
