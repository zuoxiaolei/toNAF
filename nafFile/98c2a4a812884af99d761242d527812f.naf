<raw><![CDATA[ * World equities rise, helped by upbeat company results * Greek, U.S. debt woes weigh; European yields rise * Weaker dollar propels gold to record high; oil rises * China warns on inflation dangers, forex reserves (Updates market action, adds fresh quote) By Richard Leong NEW YORK, April 19 (Reuters) - World stocks rose onTuesday, recouping the prior day's losses, but nagging debtworries on both sides of the Atlantic and new signals ofinflation dangers in China curbed appetite for risk. A weaker dollar propelled gold  to a record peak near$1,500 an ounce and oil in New York  above $108 abarrel. Investors dipped their toes back into stocks and other riskassets in part on solid company results, a day after Standard &Poor's jolted markets when the debt rating agency warned thatpolitical gridlock in Washington is impeding work on paring thehuge federal debt load. Speculation about a Greek debt restructuring as early asthis summer has also crimped investor sentiment. "We are getting a tug-of-war between the macros and micros.We are in the middle of the earnings season with these macroshocks," said Brett Hryb, senior portfolio manager at ManulifeAsset Management in Toronto. MSCI's all-country world stock index  rose0.6 percent, retracing some of Monday's 1.6 percent loss, whichwas the biggest one-day drop in a month. Wall Street stocks    rose 0.4 percentin choppy trading. Better-than-expected results from investmentbank Goldman Sachs  and healthcare company Johnson &Johnson  stoked bids for U.S. shares after they fellmore than 1 percent on Monday on sovereign debt worries. [.N] Solid earnings from luxury goods makers LVMH  andBurberry  spurred a 0.4 percent rise in European stocks after a 2 percent drop on Monday. Japan's Nikkei  closed down nearly 1.3 percent inthe wake of the prior day's losses in the United States andEurope. Investor unease persisted over a possible Greek debtrestructuring that could further strain the euro zone. Greece sold 1.6 billion euros of three-month debt but wasforced to pay a yield of more than 4 percent, more thanquadruple what Germany -- the euro zone's strongest member --pays on similar obligations. DOLLAR FALLS Standard & Poor's rattled investor confidence on Mondaywhen it changed its outlook on the United States to negativefrom stable, threatening the future of the prized AAA creditrating for the world's top economy. In currency trading on Tuesday, the U.S. dollar slipped 0.6percent against a basket of major currencies  aftermaking headway the previous day. Monday's dollar gains came on a rush for safe havensdespite the risk of S&P downgrading U.S. debt in two years ifWashington fails to achieve a budget plan that relies less ondebt. S&P's warning intensified scrutiny of the U.S. budgetdeficit and the political fight to slash it. The deficit is akey element in the global imbalances that currently worry manyinvestors and policymakers. There was no direct reaction to the S&P move on Tuesdayfrom Beijing, which holds vast reserves of U.S. Treasuries.However, the head of China's central bank said the countryshould diversify investments as its some $3 trillion of foreignexchange holdings had grown too large. Another Chinese rate setter said inflation pressures gavefurther scope for a rise in banks' reserve requirementsfollowing seven increases -- together with four raises inbenchmark interest rates -- since October. The euro recovered from the previous day's sell-off, helpedby encouraging economic data. [FRX/] The single currency rose 0.6 percent to $1.4337 .Overall, it has pulled back sharply, having hovered at a15-month high around $1.4520 for the past week. See [FRX/] Lingering worries over the cost to bail out peripheralcountries exerted pressure on the European debt market, whichlagged U.S. Treasuries. Ten-year Greek bond yields were last up 17 basis points at a euro-era highof 14.815 percent, while German Bund futures  fell 0.3percent to 122.10. The benchhmark U.S. 10-year note's yield slipped 2 basis points to 3.36 percent, its lowest in threeweeks.
