<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded lower against most of its major counterparts Monday, despite bullish U.S. retail sales data and deepening fears on the Spanish debt crisis. During U.S. afternoon trade, the dollar slipped against the euro with EUR/USD gaining 0.08% to 1.3087.  The greenback was bolstered as the U.S. Commerce Department reported that retail sales increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.8% in March, beating expectations for a modest 0.3% gain. However, February’s figure was revised to a 1.0% increase from a previously reported gain of 1.1%. In additional U.S. dollar bullish news, core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, rose by 0.8% last month, above expectations for a 0.6% gain, after rising by 0.9% in February. A separate report showed that an index of manufacturing conditions in New York deteriorated in April, growing at the slowest pace since November.  Hurting the greenback, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that its general business conditions index declined by 13.6 points to 6.6 in April from 20.2 in March.  Analysts had expected the index to decline by 2.2 points to 18.0 in April. Supporting the euro, official data reported that the euro zone posted an external trade surplus of EUR2.8 billion in February, against a deficit of EUR2.8 billion in the same month last year. Sentiment on the single currency remained muted as the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds climbed above 6% after the cost of insuring the country’s sovereign debt against default rose to a record high, amid fears that Spain will be the next euro zone member to require a bailout. The greenback traded lower against the pound, with GBP/USD gaining 0.20% to 1.5880. Sterling remained supported after recent economic data indicated that the recovery in the U.K. is gaining momentum, easing concerns the Bank of England may implement fresh stimulus measures. Sentiment on the pound was also lifted after ratings agency Standard & Poor's reaffirmed its triple-A rating on the U.K. on Friday, stating the government will be able to stick to its austerity program. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen, but was up against the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY sliding 0.52% to hit 80.49 and USD/CHF adding 0.05% to hit 0.9199. In Switzerland, official data showed that the producer price index rose less-than-expected last month, climbing 0.3%, disappointing expectations for a 0.5% gain after increasing by 0.8% in February. Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD adding 0.15% to hit 1.0011, AUD/USD losing 0.16% to hit 1.0356 and NZD/USD dropping 0.39% to hit 0.8198. In Canada, official data showed that foreign securities purchases surged by CAD12.5 billion in February, exceeding expectations for a CAD4.23 billion rise and following a CAD4.28 billion decline the previous month. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was flat at 80.03. Also Monday, the U.S. Department of the Treasury said that net foreign purchases of long-term securities totaled USD10.1 billion in February, down from purchases of USD102.4 billion in January, whose figure was revised up from a previously reported USD101.0 billion. Economists had expected Treasury International Capital purchases to total USD41.3 billion in February.             ]]></raw>
