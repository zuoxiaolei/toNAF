<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was steady against its major counterparts on Thursday, trimming some gains from the previous day’s safe haven rally but the greenback remained supported amid ongoing worries over the debt crisis in the euro zone.During European morning trade, the dollar was slightly higher against the euro, with EUR/USD slipping 0.14% to hit 1.2964.Sentiment on the single currency remained fragile amid fears over mass ratings cuts across the euro zone after last Friday’s European Union summit failed to result in any decisive measures to tackle the debt crisis.

The SNB also kept its key interest rate close to zero.In addition, official data showed that industrial production in Switzerland declined more-than-expected in the third quarter.In contrast, the greenback was up against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand cousins, with USD/CAD rising 0.10% to hit 1.0404, AUD/USD shedding 0.29% to hit 0.9880 and NZD/USD falling 0.41% to hit 0.7472.In Australia, a report earlier showed that inflation expectations slightly eased in December, while a separate report showed that new motor vehicle sales declined in November.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, inched up 0.04% to hit 81.28Later in the day, the U.S. was to produce its weekly report on initial jobless claims, as well as government data on producer price inflation and manufacturing activity in Philadelphia and New York state.             ]]></raw>
