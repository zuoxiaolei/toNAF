<raw><![CDATA[© Reuters.  Dollar remains slightly higher ahead of U.S. dataInvesting.com - The dollar held onto modest gains against the other major currencies in quiet trade on Monday, as Friday’s upbeat U.S. data continued to support the greenback, while investors eyed an upcoming report on U.S. manufacturing activity due later in the day.USD/JPY was little changed at 101.37, not far from last Thursday’s one-week highs of 101.86.The greenback strengthened after the University of Michigan said in a revised report on Friday that its consumer sentiment index hit 91.2 in September, up from a previous estimate of 89.8 and beating expectations for a reading of 90.0.Data also showed that the Chicago purchasing managers’ index rose to 54.2 this month from 51.5 the previous month, exceeding expectations for an uptick to 52.0.EUR/USD held steady at 1.1234.Market sentiment remained mildly supported following reports late last week that  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is nearing a deal to settle a mortgage-securities investigation by paying a $5.4 billion fine, well below the Justice Department’s original proposal of $14 billion.The pound dropped to three-month lows, with GBP/USD down 0.86% at 1.2866, while USD/CHF held at 0.9718.Research group Markit said its U.K. manufacturing PMI jumped to 55.4 last month from a reading of 53.3 in August.
