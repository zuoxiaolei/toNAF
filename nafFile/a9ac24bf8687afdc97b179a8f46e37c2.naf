The weakness started in European markets on fears thatGreece will have to restructure its debt possibly as early asthe summer. That put the euro on track for its biggest one-daydecline in five months against the U.S. dollar. The sell-off picked up pace later when rating agencyStandard & Poor's revised its outlook on the United States tonegative from stable, citing the risk that policymakers wouldfail to agree on proposals to trim its large budget deficit.See [ID:nN18195555] While the S&P maintained the country's top AAA creditrating, the move signals there's at least a one-in-three chancethat it could cut the long-term rating within two years. "On a day when sovereign debt troubles have returned tohaunt the euro, S&P's announcement added salt to the wound,"said Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT in New York."Investors were risk averse going into the New York open andwill now remain cautious or nervous throughout the NorthAmerican trading session." MSCI's all-country world stock index started what is in many places a holiday-shortened week bylosing 1.6 percent. Wall Street stocks tumbled in heavy volume as the S&P'smove added to worries about the global economy after Chinamoved to curb liquidity to counter rising inflation pressures.At one stage, the S&P 500 fell below 1,300 for the first timesince March 24. The Dow Jones industrial average  dropped 171.53points, or 1.39 percent, to 12,171.77. The Standard & Poor's500 Index  dropped 17.33 points, or 1.31 percent, to1,302.35.

German government sources said they did not believe Greece,which sealed a 110 billion euro ($157.7 billion) bailout fromthe EU and IMF last year, would make it through the summerwithout restructuring. The Greek government has deniedrepeatedly that it plans to restructure. See [ID:nLDE73H0IC] Pressure on Portugal also grew after the anti-euro TrueFinns party scored big gains in the Sunday vote and vowed topush for changes to a Portuguese rescue that is expected tototal 80 billion euros. SAFE-HAVEN GOLD SHINES Gold prices rallied to record highs of nearly $1,500 anounce while other commodities tumbled as investors fled tosafe-haven assets. Worries about the euro zone's debt problemsand the inflation picture in China added to investor jitters. Spot gold  rose to an all-time high of $1,497.20 anounce. Benchmark gold futures in New York  rose to arecord of $1,498.60 an ounce. [GOL/] "The U.S. debt situation got a reality check," said JohnKilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. "Only preciousmetals will be seen as attractive in the aftermath of theoutlook downgrade." Oil came under pressure after top exporter Saudi Arabiasaid weak demand had forced it to reduce crude output. Brentcrude for June  fell $1.85 to $121.60 a barrel, havingslipped as low as $121.00. U.S. crude  for May fell $2.54to $107.12, having slipped as low as $106.4. The sell-off in stocks and some commodities pushed up theyen as investors closed riskier trades funded by thelow-yielding Japanese currency. The dollar lost 0.7 percent to82.55 yen, and hit a low of 82.16 yen . In the bond market, investors resisted the temptation todump Treasuries after the S&P announcement. Shorter-dated U.S.Treasury prices rose as investors scrambled for the lowest-riskinvestments. The price of 30-year bonds also turned positive inafternoon trading, reversing early losses. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  were trading9/32 higher in price to yield 3.38 percent. The long bond rose 5/32 in price to yield 4.46 percent. Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets inToronto, said the S&P announcement is really only catching upto what the markets have already priced in."The prospect of an actual default by the U.S. on debtissued in its own currency isn't a realistic worry, in afinancial market that has a lot more real worries to deal with,including genuine Eurozone default risks," he said."We are less concerned over a downgrade to the outlook thanwe are about the growth implications of turning to fiscal belttightening before the economy has self-sustaining momentum."
