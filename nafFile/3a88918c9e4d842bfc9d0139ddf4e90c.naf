<raw><![CDATA[ (Updates with more details) * Exports beat most forecasts, led by China, U.S. demand * End 10-month spell of double-digit annual losses * Won hits one-year high, bond futures trim gains * S.Korea could be first G20 economy to lift interest rates By Seo Eun-kyung and Yoo Choonsik SEOUL, Oct 1 (Reuters) - South Korean exports in Septemberfell much less than expected and by the slowest annual pace in11 months, led by improving demand from China and the UnitedStates. and suggesting global trade was picking up. The numbers, the first batch of monthly trade data to bereleased by a major exporter, also served to reinforce marketexpectations that South Korea's interest rates may rise asearly as next month and lifted the won to a one-year high. Overseas sales in September fell 6.6 percent from a yearearlier, beating predictions of a 10.4 percent drop in aReuters poll and ending a 10-month spell of double-digit annualdeclines, government data showed on Thursday. The average export value per working day -- a usefulmeasure to judge month-on-month growth -- jumped 16 percentfrom August to an 11-month high, offering further evidence ofimprovement. Sales by destination for the first 20 days of the month --the latest available -- showed demand from China and the UnitedStates rose despite widespread concerns that the fading effectof fiscal stimulus would dampen global trade. "Exports are on a clear recovery path and they will postpositive growth in the fourth quarter helped by the baseeffect. It is hard to find a major obstacle to recovery," saidKim Jae-eun, an economist at Hyundai Securities. "The Bank of Korea is expected to raise interest rates inNovember. What matters is not if the BOK will increase ratesbut how fast." Some analysts have been sceptical whether global demand forgoods is really recovering, arguing that the effect of acoordinated global fiscal spending spree to stimulateconsumption in major economies will soon fade as the funds dryup. Analysts say the won's sharp drop against most currenciesearlier this year has also helped South Korea snatch marketshare from direct competitors such as Japan and Taiwan. But the won has been recovering fast since hitting an11-year low against the dollar in March, on optimism that SouthKorea's economy is pulling out of the crisis much faster thanexpected. ROBUST WON HITS EXPORTERS The currency's latest rise -- it touched a one-year highagainst the dollar in morning trade -- pushed shares down intop auto maker Hyundai Motor Co. and other exporters on fearsthat will eventually cut into profit margins. Officials have warned that South Korean exporters, thoughtheir successful drive to diversify markets helped cushion themfrom the worst of the global economic downturn, could veryquickly lose competitiveness if they rely too much on a weakcurrency rather than reining in manufacturing costs. A survey by Markit Economics Ltd showed the South Koreanmanufacturing sector's business activity kept on expanding inSeptember but the momentum slowed from August. Exports to China fell 1.9 percent during Sept. 1-20 over ayear earlier while sales to the United States lost 7.8 percent,compared with 10.3 percent and 11.3 percent respective declinesin August, government data showed. The strong data came as the government of President LeeMyung-bak, worried about growth, has openly questioned thecentral bank readiness to raise interest rates to prevent aproperty bubble, something the Bank of Korea fears will raisehousehold debt and eventually damage consumption. Improving imports in September also underscored reboundingdomestic corporate and household demand on optimism that theeconomy would sustain its recovery. Imports in September fell a steep 25.1 percent over a yearearlier, but the pace was the slowest in 2009 and below a 26.5percent drop forecast in a Reuters poll. Over the past several weeks, money and bond market rateshave priced in the chances of the Bank of Korea raisinginterest rates this year to possibly become the first G20central bank to tighten since the global credit crunchescalated into a full-blown world economic crisis a year ago.
