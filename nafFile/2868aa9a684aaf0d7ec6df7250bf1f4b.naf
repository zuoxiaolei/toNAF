<raw><![CDATA[ * Greek CDS rise, bond yield spreads widen * Euro falls most versus dollar in 3 weeks * US initial jobless claims rise; Capital inflows rise (Adds quotes, details, update prices) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, April 15 (Reuters) - The euro fell for the firsttime in six days against the dollar  on Thursday as the cost ofinsuring against a Greek default rose, underscoring persistentconcerns about Greece's ability to service its debt. The euro was on track for its biggest one-day fall in threeweeks against the U.S. dollar as the Greek/German governmentbond yield spread also widened to near record levels hit beforeeuro zone members agreed a standby aid package for Greece. Ministers agreed on Sunday to make available 30 billioneuros in loans with a further 15 billion coming from theInternational Monetary Fund. But uncertainty remained over howthe financial assistance would be implemented. Sentiment towards the euro also deteriorated as the cost ofinsuring against a Portuguese default hit its highest sinceFebruary after the European Commission on Wednesday said thecountry may need additional fiscal cuts this year. "The whole PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain) story iscreeping back up," said Chris Gaffney, vice president atEverBank World Markets, in St. Louis, Missouri. "The euro had run up the past (several) days prettydramatically and so a pause is going to be just natural. Themarkets were looking for an excuse to stop the euro's ascent,"he added. The euro  fell nearly a full percent to a session lowof $1.3520 earlier, its lowest in about a week, according toReuters data. It last traded 0.8 percent lower at $1.3543, morethan a U.S. cent below the day's high of $1.3666. At currentprices, it was on track for the biggest daily percentagedecline since March 24. Five-year Greek credit default swap prices rose to 455basis points, exceeding a record closing high of 444 basispoints hit a week ago. Some in the market said selling by Middle Eastern namesalso was helping push the euro lower against the dollar, andthat a break through stop-loss orders around $1.3575 and belowhad exacerbated losses. BNP Paribas this week cuts its forecast for euro/dollar andnow expects the pair to hit 1.19 by mid-2011, sayinguncertainties about the aid package for Greece will likely keepinternational investors cautious about European asset markets. The euro  also dropped 0.6 percent to 126.55 yen,after earlier slipping more than 1 percent to 125.84 yen. Greece said on Thursday it is seeking talks with the EU,the European Central Bank and the IMF on a multi-year economicprogram that could be backed by financial aid if the Greekgovernment were to seek such assistance.

STRONGER INFLOWS The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index , which tracks thegreenback versus a basket of major currencies, rose 0.4 percentto 80.536, recovering from a four-week low of 80.031 hit onWednesday. The dollar found some support after the Treasury Departmentsaid foreign purchases of U.S. securities rose in February asstrong private sector demand helped reverse an overall capitaloutflow suffered during the prior month.
