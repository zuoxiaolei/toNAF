<raw><![CDATA[ * MSCI world stocks flat at 293.00 * Euro firmer; dollar retreats from 3-mth high * Oil up more than $1 to briefly top $74 per barrel  By Sujata Rao and Mike Dolan LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - The euro stabilised on Fridayafter this week's steep losses against the dollar and yen androse off nine-month lows versus the Swiss franc while higher oilprices helped European stocks higher in thin year-end trade. Rumours of a coup in Pakistan had sent the safe-haven Swissfranc surging in early dealing but it slipped after the reportswere denied, with dealers saying the currency was also pressuredby expectations of intervention by the Swiss National Bank. Markets calmed after Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardarisaid there was no coup, dousing rumours that started after agovernment minister suspected of corruption was barred fromleaving the country. But geopolitical concerns continued to jangle nerves laterin the session and the dollar recovered ground after reportsthat Iranian troops briefly entered Iraqi territory on Thursdayand spent several hours at an Iraqi oilfield. The dollar, which had surged on Thursday to a three-monthhigh against a basket of currencies, had earlier been knockedback against the euro by a higher-than-expected reading fromGerman Ifo Institute's sentiment index for December.  "The markets are fairly illiquid which is exaggeratingmoves," said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank ofTokyo-Mitsubishi UFG. The euro rose briefly 0.4 percent top $1.44 after fallingclose to $1.4300 on Thursday, the lowest since early September.But it slipped back to $1.4350 later. It has been under pressure due to fiscal problems in eurozone member Greece which has been hit by two ratings downgradesthis month -- the latest on Thursday by Standard & Poor's.  OIL HELPS STOCKS Crude oil rose 0.8 percent to $73.41 a barrel, underpinnedby the geopolitical anxiety, signs of a recovery in U.S. demandand the prospect of increased winter demand. European stocks rose as those stronger oil prices pushed upenergy stocks and offset weakness in financials. The FTSEurofirst 300, the index of top European shares wasup 0.2 percent after losing 1.3 percent on Thursday. Oil firmsled the gains with Total, BP, BG, Royal Dutch Shell andStatoilHydro rose between 0.7 and 2 percent. Banking shares however continued to decline. "When there's a sell-off, it seems there are investorscoming back in there, though volumes are lower," said MikeLenhoff, strategist at Brewin Dolphin, in London. "Fourth-quarter earnings should be good, and show top-linegrowth, and that could be what's helping to keep the market up." World stocks were flat on the day, after Thursday's retreatand despite an early bounce. The index has risen nearly 29percent this year, on track for one of the biggest gains in thepast 20 years. "Most of the people are getting cautious. Everybody isclosing books. They say 'OK we had a great year so why do wehave to risk more?'," said Koen de Leus, economist at KBCSecurities. "We are at the end of the year so volumes are not going tobe very high." Asian shares fell half a percent as Chinese and Hong Kongbourses hit three-week closing lows on tough new governmentregulations on the real estate and banking sectors. Emerging equities lost 0.3 percent. The index has gainedabout 70 percent this year. U.S. stocks are expected to open on a firmer note withfutures for the Dow Jones average, S&P 500 and the NasdaqComposite up 0.3-0.7 percent. In bond markets, 10-year Bund yields were slightly lower at3.126 percent, with analysts expecting the futures contract tohold its recent gains, fuelled by the worries in Greece.  But the sell-off in Greek and other peripheral euro zonebonds continued, pushing the premium on 10-year Greek yieldsover benchmark Bunds back up by more than 10 basis points to 270bps -- near levels hit on Thursday after the S&P ratingsdowngrade..  "We saw this morning Greece again under limited pressurewith the spreads widening moderately. We continue to see thedemand for safety driving the market. This offers core debtmarkets some support," said Patrick Jacq, a rates strategist atBNP Paribas in London. "We are going into end of year where people are probablylooking for less risk positioning, so that offers the marketsome support as well."
