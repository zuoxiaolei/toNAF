<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar rises versus basket of currencies * Euro breaks below key technical support * Fed officials play down surprise move (Adds quote, detail; previous TOKYO) By Neal Armstrong LONDON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - The dollar surged across theboard on Friday, driving the euro to a nine-month low in thewake of the Federal Reserve's announcement that it would raisethe interest rate it charges banks for emergency loans. The Fed said late on Thursday the discount rate would beincreased to 0.75 from 0.50 percent, effective Friday, althoughit left the benchmark federal funds rate, its main policy tool,unchanged near zero.  Currency markets took the decision as a signal that the U.S.central bank was starting to normalize policy, despiteassurances from one Fed policymaker to the contrary. "Even though this is not an official tightening, it showsthat the Fed is at least 'moving'. The Bank of Japan may requiremore quantitative easing and the ECB cannot change its stance,so that is why the dollar is rallying against the euro and theyen", said Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank. At 0850 GMT, the dollar was trading up over 1 percent versusa basket of currencies after rallying to an eight- month high of81.342. The euro hovered close to a nine-month low of $1.3444 versusthe dollar hit after a break of key technical support. Traders said a 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of lastyear's rally from $1.2455 to $1.5145 had been taken out at$1.3485, with a close below this level today opening the way forfurther losses. The dollar has been making gains over recent weeks on theback of positive U.S. economic data, while structural problemsin the euro zone have weighed on the single currency, promptinga fall of over 10 percent against the greenback since December. "We continue to favour the dollar and expect that furtherimprovement in US data combined with persistent euro zonesovereign credit concerns will be dollar-supportive," saidanalysts at UBS in a note. Against the yen, the dollar rose to highest levels in amonth at 92.10 yen, remaining buoyed around the 92.00 level inEuropean dealing. Technical analysts were eyeing the 200-day moving average asthe next resistance level to watch at 92.30.  TIMING While the timing surprised the market, Fed Chairman BenBernanke had said last week the central bank could soon raisethe discount rate. He had stressed, however, that the move wouldnot be akin to tightening monetary policy. St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard saidinvestors belief in high probability of a rise in the Fed'sbenchmark rate this year was "overblown" and that the discountrate rise should not be seen as a policy signal."The Bullard comments are an attempt to calm the marketsbecause the move came as a bit of a surprise, despite what wassaid in the Fed minutes this week", said Commerzbank's Praefcke. The Australian dollar extended losses despite hints byReserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens that furtherinterest rate rises were likely. The Aussie fell 0.5 percent to $0.8887 and shed 0.7 percentagainst the yen to 81.63 yen. It also backed off a decade highagainst the euro set the previous day. Sterling also remained under pressure, dropping to anine-month low of $1.5377 versus the dollar as the poundstruggled in the wake of Thursday's disappointing public sectorfinance data.
