<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar/yen dips in thin market * Aussie hits 11-month high vs dollar after RBA comments * Dollar and yen seen likely to resume broad slide * Yen takes cues from fluctuation in Chinese shares By Masayuki Kitano TOKYO, Aug 14 (Reuters) - The dollar dipped against the yenon Friday, pulling away from eight-week highs hit last week, hurtby the previous day's disappointing U.S. retail sales data and asthe yen rose due to a fall in Chinese shares. The Australian dollar hit an 11-month high against the dollarand initially rose against the yen after Reserve Bank ofAustralia Governor Glenn Stevens said normal interest rates forAustralia would be noticeably higher than the current 3 percentcash rate. But the Aussie later trimmed gains, with the yen edginghigher on crosses as Chinese shares fell 2.4 percent. Falls in equities or data that cast doubts about the outlookfor the global economy can dent risk appetite and trigger sellingof higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollaragainst the dollar and the yen. Trading was thin, with some Japanese traders away for themid-August "Obon" holidays. While market players were keeping a close eye on fluctuationsin Chinese equities, and despite Thursday's disappointing U.S.retail sales data, traders said the overall trend still seemed tobe towards an improvement in risk appetite. "I get the strong impression that optimistic views on theoutlook for the economy will continue for a while," said TokichiIto, deputy general manager for Trust & Custody Services Bank'sforex team. As a result, the dollar and yen seem likely to head loweragainst other currencies, Ito said. The dollar is likely to havethe upper hand against the yen, and could gradually rise towards100 yen in September or October, he said. The dollar fell 0.4 percent against the yen to 95.15 yen,pulling away from an eight-week high of 97.79 yen hit late lastweek on trading platform EBS after stronger-than- expected U.S.jobs data. A trader for a Japanese brokerage house said the dollar wascarrying over its weakness against the yen from the previous day,when the greenback fell on data showing a surprise dip in U.S.total retail sales in July. The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.4267, giving back some ofthe gains it made on Thursday when data showed that Germany andFrance unexpectedly returned to growth in the second quarter. The Australian dollar dipped 0.1 percent to $0.8418, havingretreated after hitting an 11-month high of $0.8479 earlier inthe day. The Aussie slipped 0.3 percent against the yen to 80.07 yen. Some traders said gains in the dollar against the yen couldbe limited in the near term, due to the potential for fundrepatriation by Japanese investors related to $27 billion incoupon payments on U.S. Treasuries due on Aug.15. In addition, $61 billion in coupon securities mature on thesame day. (Editing by Chris Gallagher)             ]]></raw>
