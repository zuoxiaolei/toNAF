<raw><![CDATA[ * Surprise U.S. jobs data lifts dollar vs yen, euro * Commodity-linked and risk-sensitive currencies rise * Talk of possible Greek euro zone exit hurts euro * Low interest rates still expected to hobble greenback (Updates prices, adds comment, media report on Greece) By Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the yenand euro on Friday but fell against higher-yielding currenciesas a surprisingly large jump in U.S. payrolls soothed worriesabout the economy and whetted traders' appetite for risk. The euro faced added selling pressure after a German mediareport suggested Greece had raised the possibility of leavingthe euro zone, a scenario that analysts said would causeproblems for European banks exposed to Greek debt. For more,see [ID:nBAT006205] The euro beat a further retreat from a 17-month high above$1.49. The currency hit a session low of $1.4373 and is down1.1 pct at $1.4380 , heading for its worst week againstthe dollar since January. "Greece leaving the euro zone could cause a cascade ofproblems, especially for the banking sector and particularly ifthe European Union allows Greece unilaterally to default on itsloans," said Geoffrey Yu, senior currency strategist at UBS. The dollar also got a boost from data showing U.S.employers added 244,000 jobs last month, well above whateconomists had expected. That boosted U.S. bond yields andincreased the dollar's appeal against the yen. It was last up0.4 percent at 80.49 yen . It also offered respite for a market that was trying todigest a recent run of weaker-than-expected U.S. data that somefeared pointed to a slowdown in the pace of U.S. growth. Concern that the world economy would also lose steamspurred a massive run for the exit on Thursday, sending oilinto free-fall and hurting high-yielding currencies such as theAustralian dollar that are sensitive to commodity prices andthe global growth outlook. Thursday's commodity rout spurred traders to unwind tradesfinanced with cheaply borrowed dollars, and the greenback hadits best day against major rivals since October.  Those moves were partly reversed on Friday, though oildipped back under $100 a barrel after the Der Spiegel onlinereport on Greece. It fell 10 percent on Thursday.  "Yesterday was an overreaction, a sort of 'get-me-out' nowmoment driven by margin traders who feared the global economywas getting worse," said Brian Dolan, chief strategist atForex.com. "That just doesn't seem to be the case, and the jobsnumber shows the U.S. economy is still recovering.  There willbe setbacks, but we think it will continue to plod along." The Australian dollar soared 1.5 percent to $1.0740, helped after the central bank warned already high4.75 percent interest rates may have to rise further, whileCanada's dollar  rose on the stronger U.S. jobs data. MEDIUM-TERM EURO OUTLOOK POSITIVE Analysts predicted the dollar would stay well supported inthe short-term against major currencies such as the yen andeuro but would struggle against commodity-linked currencies. "Different currencies have different sensitivities to risk,so the dollar won't gain as much against the Australian dollar,for instance, as against the yen," said Steven Englander, headof G10 FX strategy at Citigroup.  Some traders, though, said the euro was still likely togain against the dollar in the medium term, as euro zoneinterest rates are expected to rise much more quickly thanthose in the United States. The euro fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday after theEuropean Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet signaled arate hike was unlikely next month but left the door open to amove in July. "We've had a healthy correction in euro/dollar, but I don'tthink this is a sea-change in sentiment and wouldn't expect itto move much below $1.45," said RBS strategist Paul Robson. Dolan said expectations of a June ECB rate hike took theeuro from $1.46 to $1.49 earlier this week and had simplypriced that move out. He said the euro will likely settle intoa $1.4450-$1.48 range over the coming weeks. And even with the stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data,few investors are pricing in U.S. interest rate hikes any timesoon, particularly with the jobless rate jumping from 8.8percent to 9 percent in April. [ID:nOAT004799] "All the major headwinds are still there -- 9 percentunemployment, a housing market still in the tank, high food andenergy prices impeding consumer spending," Dolan said. Douglas Borthwick, managing director of Faros Trading,said, "The U.S. economy remains weak and so shall the dollar."
