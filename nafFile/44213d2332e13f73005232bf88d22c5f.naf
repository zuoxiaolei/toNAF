<raw><![CDATA[ * Libya declares cease-fire, stocks rise * G7 intervenes to weaken yen * Dollar spikes more than 3 percent higher * Oil prices drop after Libya move (Updates with U.S. markets' open, adds New York dateline,byline) By Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Al Yoon LONDON/NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose onFriday after a Libya ceasefire reduced tension in the regionand the Group of Seven calmed markets about Japan's nuclearcrisis, while G7 intervention broke the yen's rise. Oil fell after Libya declared a cease-fire in the countryto protect civilians and comply with a United Nationsresolution passed overnight. "The end of military action is a great step," said JimVogel, interest rate strategist with FTN Financial in Memphis,Tennessee.

Brent crude  had surged above $116 a barrel onworries of escalating unrest in oil-rich countries after theU.N. approved military action to contain Libya's MuammarGaddafi. It traded down 0.5 percent at $114.31 a barrel afterthe cease-fire. U.S. crude fell 0.5 percent to $100.88. The dollar was last up nearly 3 percent at 81.12 yen,retreating from a session high of around 81.98 yen ,following the G7 announcement, which came just as the Tokyostock market opened. The show of solidarity by the G7 major developed economiesto support Japan through its biggest crisis since World War Twocomes a day after the yen soared to a record 76.25 per dollarin chaotic trading. It is the first coordinated currencyintervention by the G7 in a decade. The G7 "is just helping sentiment, and stocks sensitive torisk will push on. But optimism is going to be guarded as thereare no firm resolutions surrounding the Japanese nuclear crisisand the Middle East, and anything can happen on the weekend,"said Giles Watts, head of equities at City Index in London. The Dow Jones industrial average  jumped 139.18points, or 1.18 percent, to 11,913.77. The Standard & Poor's500 Index  was up 13.69 points, or 1.07 percent, at1,287.41 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 26.28points, or 1.00 percent, to 2,662.33.

Traders noted the scale of intervention was sofar a tame effort to stem the yen's surge. Some market observers said even massive official sellingmight not restrain the yen for long, pointing to Japan's lastintervention in September 2010 when it sold a huge 2.1 trillionyen, or around $25 billion worth, but only managed to push thedollar up from 82.85 to 85.77 yen. "It would need to be concerted and aggressive....and eventhen I'm sceptical," said Richard Wiltshire, a currency traderat ETX Capital in London. A New York Federal Reserve spokesman said the U.S. centralbank had joined the G7 in intervening to weaken the yen.
