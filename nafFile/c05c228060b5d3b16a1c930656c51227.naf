<raw><![CDATA[ (Repeats to widen distribution) * Asian stocks hit 2-wk high, Nikkei up though pares gains * U.S. ISM builds on China, Aussie data to soothe econfears * Dollar on defensive, commodities up By Elaine Lies TOKYO, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Asian stocks hit a two-week high,with Japan's Nikkei briefly rising more than 2 percent, asstrong U.S. manufacturing data further soothed worries aboutthe global economy. The dollar was on the defensive, while commodities gained,helping make materials shares some of the strongest performersacross the region. European shares fell, after rising at their fastest pace inthree months in the previous session. Britain's FTSE 100 opened down 0.3 percent, Germany's DAX  fell0.2 percent and France's CAC 40  fell 0.5 percent. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of U.S.factory activity rose to 56.3 in August from 55.5 in July, muchhigher than forecast by economists. [ID:nN01115840] Coming on the heels of strong Chinese manufacturing dataand stronger-than-expected growth in Australia, the numberseased investor fears about the pace of global economic recoveryand helped Wall Street to its best day in eight weeks. [.N] But gains in Asian stocks, which were also boosted bystrong tech shares, appeared capped by wariness about whetherthe global economy is truly on the path to recovery, as well asconcern about closely watched U.S. non-farm payrolls data onFriday. "You're getting a lot of quick, knee-jerk reactions in bothdirections, up and down. These disparate pieces of economicdata are being reacted to but the information is by no meansclear," said Angus Gluskie, portfolio manager at White FundsManagement in Australia. "We've got the potential for markets to pick up stronglyinto the end of the year, but we may well have to go through afew nervous weeks in September first." The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan pared gains to 0.7 percent after earlier risingto its highest level since mid-August. Japan's benchmark Nikkei  rose more than 2 percentat one point, moving further away from a 16-month low hit onWednesday, helped by what some market players said was buyingby domestic institutional investors at lows and buying offutures by foreign players. But the Nikkei pared gains to 1.5 percent. It lost 7.5percent in August and is down roughly 14 percent on the year. Seoul shares  rose 0.6 percent, led by tech stocks,with market players saying foreign investors, cheered by therise on Wall Street, could turn strong buyers. Australian stocks  climbed 0.8 percent to athree-week high, with miners such as Rio Tinto  gainingafter copper prices rose to a four-month high. DEFENSIVE DOLLAR The dollar retained most of the losses sustained theprevious day, when upbeat data helped lure investors away fromsafe-haven currencies and assets. The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performanceagainst a basket of six major currencies, was steady on the dayat 82.565  after falling 0.9 percent on Wednesday,marking its biggest one-day fall in six weeks. The greenback edged down 0.3 percent to 84.17 yen but still stayed above a 15-year low of 83.58 yen hit lastweek. Though the ISM data boosted higher-yielding currencies suchas the Australian dollar, investors have now turned hesitantabout taking fresh positions ahead of the European CentralBank's policy meeting later in the day and Friday's closelywatched monthly U.S. job report. "Investors are not aggressively taking risks yet, feelingthey need to see the U.S. employment figures before decidinghow much risk they can really take," said Shuichi Kanehira,head of FX spot trading at Mizuho Corporate Bank. Traders said more players have started to wonder ifJapanese authorities might intervene in the currency market torein in the yen's strength even before it passes its all-timehigh against the dollar. This view was reinforced later on Thursday after Japaneseprime ministerial candidate Ichiro Ozawa said that action wasneeded to stop rapid rises in the yen. [ID:nTKF106994] But gold turned lower after hitting $1,254.65 on Wednesday,its highest since June 28, as investors sought out riskierassets instead of bullion. Oil dipped as well in later trade as investors turned theirattention to the jobs data, after rising 2.8 percent the daybefore on the strong manufacturing data. U.S. crude for October delivery  edged down to $73.83a barrel at 0615 GMT after a jump of nearly $2 on Wednesday.
