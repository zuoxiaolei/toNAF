<raw><![CDATA[ * Sees 2010 Auto's EBIT margin in low single-digit percentrange * To maintain Auto's 1.46 bln-eur adj free cash flow in 2010 * CFO sees 2010 group vehicle sales up at least 5 percent  * Shares down 0.9 percent, European auto sector index gains   (Rewrites throughout adding new management comments) By Christiaan Hetzner  MUNICH, March 17 (Reuters) - German carmaker BMW expects itsrejuvenated model line-up to deliver a bounce in profits thisyear but remains cautious, not least because of fears that afast-growing Chinese market could suddenly screech to a halt. It hopes pretax profits will rise "significantly" from lastyear's depressed level of 413 million euros ($570 million), withbetter results expected across the group, but said on Wednesdayits recovery would still be a gradual one. "We want to see visible progress in 2010 towards achievingour profitability targets for 2012," Chief Executive NorbertReithofer said at an annual news conference. BMW's finance chief said he was certain that group vehiclesales would rise over 5 percent this year to above 1.3 millionvehicles, but he cautioned it was too early to be more specificabout earnings as considerable uncertainties remained and therevamped 5 Series car was only just going into showrooms. "The full year effect will then first come next year, so wehave to see that we make our ascent in stages as we move towardsour 2012 targets," Friedrich Eichiner told Reuters on thesidelines of the company's annual earnings press conference.  For its core Automobiles business that means an operatingreturn on sales in the low single-digit percentage range thisyear as opposed to a 0.6 percent loss last year. It has a targetof reaching an 8-10 percent profit margin by 2012. Adjusted for a likely third tranche of funding to movepension liabilities off its balance sheet this year, BMW expectsthe Autos business will finance itself by generating roughly thesame amount of free cash as the 1.46 billion euros from 2009. Shares in BMW underperformed other European auto stocks onWednesday, since investors are already expecting profits to morethan triple this year as premium car sales begin to recover. Theshares closed down 0.9 percent at 32.5 euros while the StoxxEuropean autos sector index added 0.3 percent. A Reuters poll of 10 analysts published before last week'sresults showed the market expects pretax profit to rise to 1.45billion euros this year from just 413 million in 2009.  CHINA Although China overtook the U.S. auto market last year asthe world's largest, BMW executives fear its currentdouble-digit growth rates are unsustainable. "China risks overheating. If the brakes were applied to theeconomic growth it would impact our business, but we cannot saywhether this will happen nor is it in our control," Eichinertold Reuters. BMW group sales chief Ian Robertson said any attempt byBeijing to reduce economic growth could take effect just asrapidly as the 2009 stimulus package boosted growth. "China is beginning to expand perhaps too quickly and Iexpect that the Chinese government will probably try andrestrain some of that," Robertson said. "When they boosted the economy (last year) it happened veryquickly so if they do something to restrain it, it could besimilar," BMW's head of sales explained. He said retail volumes would "burst through the 100,000mark" this year in China, currently its fourth biggest marketwith roughly 90,500 vehicles delivered to customers in 2009.  SMALLER CARS Any slowdown in China could hurt its rival Audi, whichovertook BMW, Mercedes and Porsche last year as the premiumbrand with the most earnings, mainly thanks to its dominance ofthe Chinese luxury car market and its ability to build smallcars profitably together with parent VW. Analysts believe BMW and Mercedes must find a way to gettingthe same economies of scale as Volkswagen and Audi, now thatemission regulations are forcing premium carmakers to offersmaller cars with lower carbon emissions. "We expect the premium small car segment to grow by 4-6percent annually until 2020," Reithofer said, adding the groupwould cut its CO2 fleet emissions by at least 25 percent by 2020from 2008 levels, when they were 156 grams per km. Separately, Porsche published its first-half report onWednesday that showed its sports car brand earned an operatingmargin of 10.4 percent in the six months to end-January.
