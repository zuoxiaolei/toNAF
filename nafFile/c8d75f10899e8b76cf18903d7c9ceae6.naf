<raw><![CDATA[ BERLIN, Dec 30 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister WolfgangSchaeuble reiterated on Thursday the euro zone should not issuejoint sovereign bonds to tackle future crises, adding that theeuro would prove to be a stable international currency. "The higher yield level expressed in so-called spreads isboth incentive and sanction (to have a stable fiscal policy),"Schaeuble wrote in a contribution to the German Tagesspiegelnewspaper to be published on Thursday. He added that Greece's and Ireland's failure to repay theirdebt were signs the system worked. "That's why this mechanism should not be put out of workthrough a collectivisation of the yield level, including in theform of euro bonds," Schaeuble added. Germany has been determined to kill off the idea of issuingcommon European bonds, a proposal championed by Jean-ClaudeJuncker, the chairman of euro zone finance ministers, amongothers, with the aim of stepping up fiscal integration. While peripheral euro zone countries are struggling withthe burden of a sovereign debt crisis, Germany -- Europe'slargest economy -- is steaming ahead and widening the gap withits peers. Germany fears euro bonds would raise its borrowing costs --the lowest in the European Union -- and make it subsidiseprofligate states. It also worries E-bonds would reduce marketdiscipline on countries to reduce their budget deficits. Schaeuble wrote that the European Council's decisions inOctober and December had set the stage for turning this year'sshort-term crisis management into a permanent system ofstabilisation next year. Such a system should also involve private creditors, headded. "It is also clear that a permanent crisis managementmechanism doesn't just assume the solidarity of all euro memberstates but also must include a contribution from creditors incase of restructuring." That would prove the euro as a stable internationalcurrency, he said. "Most of all it will convince the international financialworld that the euro remains a long-term stable currency thatthe entire world depends on, not least because the realproblems in other parts of the world are by no means smallerthan those in Europe."
