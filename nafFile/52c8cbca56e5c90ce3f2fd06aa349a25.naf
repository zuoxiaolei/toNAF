<raw><![CDATA[ BEIJING, Aug 20 (Reuters) - China's pilot programme tosettle trade in yuan has run into a roadblock because foreignbuyers either have little access to the Chinese currency or arereluctant to part with it, state media reported on Thursday. Guangdong province, the country's export hub, was supposedto be a cornerstone of the experiment in internationalising thecurrency. But local officials said they were finding few foreigncounterparts who would pay for Chinese goods in yuan, Xinhuanews agency reported. "Expectations of yuan appreciation widely exist amongforeign buyers, and they are not willing to settle trade dealsin yuan,", the state-run news agency said in its report. Foreign firms also have had difficulty getting their handson yuan, it said. China settles the vast majority of its trade in dollars andits partially closed financial account means that the yuan isgenerally not available in foreign exchange markets. China officially launched the pilot programme in July toallow companies in selected regions to settle imports andexports in yuan, which was heralded as a major step towardseventually internationalising the Chinese currency and cuttingits reliance on the dollar. Guangdong, which was supposed to play a leading role in yuansettlement through its trade with neighbouring Hong Kong, hasallowed 273 local exporters to join the trial.
