<raw><![CDATA[ VILNIUS, June 2 (Reuters) - The euro zone needs to agree onsanctions to make sure every member follows the rules to regainmarket confidence, Finland's prime minister said on Wednesday. Greece has negotiated a 110 billion euro ($135 billion)rescue package with the EU and IMF to help it deal with its debtcrisis, but the markets were gripped with fears of spill-over toover euro zone member states, driving the euro down. "Today we have a lack of confidence...Markets do not trustthat we are following our own rules," Matti Vanhanen told a newsconference at the Baltic Sea States Summit. He said sanctions were needed to punish those who arebreaking the criteria agreed in the EU treaties or not followingrecommendations from the European Commission or the Council. "One quite effective sanction may be if we cut payments tothe member states, one sanction has been mentioned that you haveno right to vote, or there can be also some other sanctions," hesaid. "The result has to be that we can trust everyone follows therules." Germany, the biggest contributor to the package, wants tostrengthen the enforcement of EU budget rules with stifferpenalties for rampant violators. However, EU officials have said penalties including thewithdrawal of voting rights in extreme cases already existed inEU treaties, and that leaders were already considering creatinga stronger link between access to EU funds and compliance withthe rules. Vanhanen later also told journalists that he believed eurozone member states may come up with a decision regardingsanctions within a few months. "I believe that during the next few months it is possible tofind if we have strong enough political commitments to acceptthese sanctions," he told journalists. "Actually, I think that the precondition for the Greecepackage was these sanctions," he added. The euro , which fell more than 7 percent against thedollar in May, hit a new four-year low on Tuesday on worriesthat the euro zone's debt crisis is spreading to its bankingsystem. It is down around 14 percent so far this year. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who camefor the Baltic Sea States Summit, played down any worries onWednesday about the European Union's single currency. "The euro is a strong and stable currency," he toldreporters after meeting Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite. (Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis; Editing by Toby Chopra)             ]]></raw>
