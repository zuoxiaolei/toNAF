<raw><![CDATA[ * EU diplomats say see no swift lifting of Ivorian sanctions * Cocoa exports to Europe unlikely to resume in coming days  (Adds detail, background) BRUSSELS, March 31 (Reuters) - European Union sanctions onIvory Coast remain in force, including an embargo on cocoashipments from major exporting port San Pedro, EU diplomats inBrussels said on Thursday. Forces loyal to Alassane Ouattara -- internationallyrecognised as the winner of November's presidential election --seized control of San Pedro overnight, raising hopes of aresumption in cocoa exports from the world's top producer.[ID:nLDE72U004 "All the sanctions remain in place, including sanctions onSan Pedro port ... No exemptions were foreseen in the initiallist of sanctions," one EU diplomat in Brussels told Reuters. "No such (exemption) is actually being discussed, but ifthat were to be the case, it would take at least four to fivedays to enter into force," a second diplomat said. The EU placed sanctions on the San Pedro port authority inJanuary which blocked its cocoa exports to Europe, in an attemptto stop presidential incumbent Laurent Gbagbo using funds fromthe lucrative trade to retain his grip on power. Despite Ouattara's forces having taken swathes of territoryin Ivory Coast in recent days, including in the country'swestern cocoa-producing belt, the EU is currently ruling out anysudden end to its sanctions on the west African state. The quickest option to resume cocoa exports from Ivory Coastcould be for Ouattara to create a new entity with a separateadministrative and financial structure from the current SanPedro port authority, one of the EU diplomats said. The EU is currently considering extending its sanctions tonew entities and individuals in Ivory Coast, possibly includingadding more officials to the list of people subject to EU visabans and asset freezes. The U.N. Security Council imposed travel bans and assetfreezes on Gbagbo and his closest associates on Wednesday, withall 15 council members voting for a resolution that echoesearlier U.N. calls for Gbagbo to step down and seeking toprevent use of heavy weapons in Abidjan.
