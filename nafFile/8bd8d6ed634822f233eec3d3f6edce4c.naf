<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro held steady against the U.S. dollar on Monday, trading close to a two-year low as investors eyed a meeting of euro zone finance ministers due to begin later in the day, while surging Spanish borrowing costs and global growth fears continued to weigh.EUR/USD hit 1.2316 during European afternoon trade, the daily high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2295, adding 0.06%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.2256, the session low and a two-year low and resistance at 1.2400, the high of July 6.Sentiment on the euro remained vulnerable as the yield on Spain’s 10-year government bonds climbed to 7.11% earlier, above the 6% threshold, widely seen as unsustainable, ahead of a meeting of euro zone finance ministers later Monday. Euro zone officials were expected to discuss a plan announced last month and designed to help the region’s indebted countries and their struggling banking systems.The single currency came under pressure earlier after data showed that investor confidence in the euro zone for July deteriorated to the lowest level since July 2009, remaining in negative territory for the 12th consecutive month.Sentix research group said its index of investor confidence declined to minus 29.6 in July from June’s reading of minus 28.9.Meanwhile, disappointing economic reports from the U.S. and China sparked fresh concerns over the outlook for growth in the world’s two largest economies.Official data on Friday showed that the U.S. economy added just 80,000 jobs in June, below market expectations for a gain of around 90,000. It was the third consecutive month where hiring failed to top the 100,000-level.In China, government data released earlier Monday showed that consumer price inflation accelerated at the slowest rate since January 2010 in June, sparking fresh concerns over a deeper-than-expected slowdown in China.Premier Wen Jiabao said over the weekend that China’s economy faces “relatively large” downward pressure in the near-term.Elsewhere, the euro was also steady against the pound with EUR/GBP easing up 0.05%, to hit 0.7938.Later in the day, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was to testify before the European Parliament, in Brussels.             ]]></raw>
