<raw><![CDATA[ * Protest organisers want symbolic "shedding of blood" * Stock market higher, baht firm as protest is peaceful * Numbers drop as people from provinces start to leave (Recasts, adds analyst comments, details throughout) By Ambika Ahuja BANGKOK, March 16 (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters inThailand donated blood to be poured outside the premier'soffice on Tuesday, a "sacrifice for democracy" aimed atenergising their movement after the government refused to stepdown. Tens of thousands of red-shirted supporters of former primeminister Thaksin Shinawatra remained at their encampment incentral Bangkok, frustrated that after four days of peacefulprotests, the government showed no sign of calling freshelections, which Thaksin's allies would be well placed to win. The absence of violence and a growing view that PrimeMinister Abhisit Vejjajiva can ride out the crisis lifted Thaistocks 1.4 percent by midday. The baht currency firmed. Despite the tensions, foreign investors have been buyers ofThai stocks for the past 15 sessions, scooping up a net $850million over that period, although volumes slowed this week. "If we can get past this week, things should return tonormal and fund flows should start building up again," saidPatareeya Benjapolchai, president of the Stock Exchange ofThailand. "Fundamentally, Thailand isn't bad looking," she added. That message was reinforced by U.S. investment bank MorganStanley, which upgraded its recommendation on Thailand's stockmarket to "overweight" in a note to clients. At the protest site, there were clear signs of fatigue.Some complained of failure to produce quick results. Otherswhithered under Bangkok's scorching sun. Of the 150,000demonstrators who massed on Sunday, many were returning totheir rural provinces. "They have been on the streets since Saturday and it'stough. We will keep going because this is about the long-termbenefit to Thailand," said Jaran Ditthapichai, a protestleader.     Early on Tuesday, "red shirts" lined up under atent to give blood to medical volunteers and nurses. Theleaders said this would be spilled outside Abhisit's office inwhat they are calling a symbolic shedding of blood fordemocracy. "When the picture of this reaches Abhisit, won't he be justa little bit ashamed of himself?" said Rung Suramanee, 76, aretired civil servant as she gave blood. "I am ready tosacrifice anything for majority rule to return." Health workers said the 10 cubic cm (0.6 cubic inches) ofblood taken from each protester was a waste, and potentiallyunsanitary and dangerous. SIGNS OF FRUSTRATION Despite days of fiery rhetoric by demonstrators on how themainly rural "red shirts" have been marginalised by themilitary, urban elite and royalists who back Abhisit, someexpressed frustration about the seeming lack of impact from therally. "I want to step it up and do something bold," said ManatTengmanee from northern Lampang province. Fears of violence briefly surfaced on Monday when threegrenades exploded at a Bangkok army base, wounding twosoldiers, just hours after Abhisit appeared on televisionrejecting their demands to dissolve parliament. It was unclearwhether the attack was linked to the demonstrations. Economists say prolonged unrest could hurt businesses anddelay an expected interest rate rise. That looks less likelygiven the orderly ests, although Bank of Thailand AssistantGovernor Paiboon Kittisrikangwan said on Tuesday the bank willconsider politics when it next reviews rates. Worries about the political situation helped depressconsumer confidence in February, after months of improvement asthe economy recovered from a brief recession. The twice-elected Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in2006 and later sentenced in absentia to two years jail forgraft. He fled into exile shortly before his sentence waspassed and lives mainly in Dubai, although thought now to be inEurope. Core "red shirt" leaders echoed Thaksin's recent calls forpatience but analysts said a drop in numbers may force theleaders to start looking for ways to end the rally. "It's tricky for them. They have to do it in a way thatdoes not embarrass the leaders and disappoint participants toomuch because that could undermine their credibility among theirown supporters," said political scientist SomjaiPhagaphasvivat. "But it would help their image, especially among the publicwho are on the fence -- people who agree with their cause buthave been reluctant to join because they do not support Thaksinand disagree with violence." Asked if he was ready to talk to the protesters, Abhisittold reporters before leaving to look at drought problems inthe north: "If they want to exchange ideas ... I am willing tolisten, but I have to decide on the basis of the wholecountry." Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban said the governmentremained vigilant as it continued to receive intelligence thatthere could be sabotage, including bombings and arson. Criticshave accused the government of scaremongering. Allies of Thaksin, hugely popular in the vote-rich northand northeast, are likely to win the next election, which mustcalled by the end of 2011, just as they have every poll heldsince 2001.
