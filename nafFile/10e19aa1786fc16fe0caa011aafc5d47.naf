<raw><![CDATA[ JERUSALEM, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Israel's economy is forecast to grow 4 percent in 2010, slightly below a previousestimate of 4.1 percent, due to expectations of a smaller risein exports, the Central Bureau of Statistics said on Sunday. The economy grew 0.8 percent in 2009. The bureau said its new estimate was based on seven to ninemonths of data. It also revised second-quarter growth to anannualised 4.5 percent from 4.6 percent. First quarter growthwas lowered to 3.7 percent from 3.8 percent. Israel's central bank also expects growth of 4 percent in2010 and a slower 3.8 percent growth rate in 2011, as Israel hasrebounded well from a brief recession but still facesuncertainty due to weakness in the United States and Europe. Exports, which comprise more than 40 percent of Israel'seconomic activity, are forecast to grow 9.1 percent in 2010,compared with a prior estimate of 13.1 percent and a 12.5percent drop last year. Consumer spending is projected to grow 4.6 percent this yearafter a 1.7 percent rise in 2009. Investment in fixed assets ispredicted to rise 6.2 percent after a 5.8 percent decline lastyear.
