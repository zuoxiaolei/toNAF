<raw><![CDATA[ * FDI to Turkey hit by global crisis in 2009 * Energy, food, finance and infrastructure to be 2010 focus * FDI from BRICs eyed by Turkey  By Alexandra Hudson and Nevzat Devranoglu ISTANBUL, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Foreign investment in Turkey ispicking up and may top this year's target of $9-10 billion in2010, the head of the country's investment agency said onFriday. Alpaslan Korkmaz told Reuters in an interview inflows ofcapital would focus on sectors including energy, infrastructure,agriculture and food, as well as finance and insurance. He said a Gulf investor was poised to announce an investmentworth hundreds of millions of dollars either this year or earlynext year, although he declined to give further details. "We feel an improvement now... Companies which suspendedtheir investment projects are now reconsidering them ... Nextyear will most probably be better than this year," he said. FDI into Turkey totalled $18.2 billion in 2008 and $22billion in 2007, but the financial crisis reduced inflows to thecountry sharply, with 2009's amount equal to that seen in 2005. Strong economic growth from 2002 until 2007 was mirrored bysoaring foreign investment, particularly in Turkey's bankingsector, by firms eager to reach a youthful, increasinglyaffluent population of some 72 million. Korkmaz said despite falling inflows, overall investment inTurkey's renewable energy sector increased in 2009 and energywould be a major focus in 2010. Turkey, a net energy importer, is looking to profile itselfas an energy hub and key transit country. It is also anxious toboost domestic electricity production, threatened by shortfallsin 2010. Insurance would also be a focus given Turkey has one of thelowest percentages of insured people in Europe, he said. Turkey's Akbank  said in October it was seeking astrategic partner for its Aksigorta insurance unit. Korkmaz added he did not believe the Dubai debt debaclewould hit Gulf investment into Turkey, and that emerging peerssuch as Russia, China and India would increasingly invest inTurkey. The new generation of Chinese cars could be made in Turkeyhe said, exploiting Turkey's proximity to the Middle Eastmarket.
