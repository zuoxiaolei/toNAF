<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The Australian dollar pared earlier gains against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday, amid a fresh wave of risk aversion, following Fitche's debt rating downgrade of the euro zone's largest bank, BNP Paribas.AUD/USD hit 0.8759 during European morning trade, shedding 0.09%, after retreating from a daily high of 0.8831. The pair was likely to find support at 0.8582, Thursday's low, and resistance at 0.903, the high of May 11.The Aussies losses came in the wake of credit rating agency Fitch’s decision to downgrade the debt rating of the bank by one notch from AAA to AA, late Monday. The move sparked fresh fears that Europe's sovereign debt crisis was spreading to the banking sector and undermined investor sentiment.Meanwhile, the Aussie was up against the euro, with EUR/AUD shedding 0.21% to hit 1.4015.Earlier Tuesday, official data showed that while German business sentiment rose unexpectedly in June, the euro zone’s current account recorded a deficit in April, defying expectations of a surplus.             ]]></raw>
