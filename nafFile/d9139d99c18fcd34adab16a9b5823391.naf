<raw><![CDATA[ * Carrefour assets will help PTT expand retail business * Media reports Central Group joining bidding (Adds quotes, details) By Pisit Changplayngam RAYONG, Thailand, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Thailand's top energyfirm, PTT Pcl, said on Wednesday it had put in a bid to buy theThai operations of French retailer Carrefour SA, which analystsexpect to fetch about $600 million. Carrefour, Europe's top retailer, wants to sell its storesin Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand at a potential price of $1billion to focus on markets where it holds leading positions. In recent years, Carrefour has withdrawn from other Asiancountries, including Japan and South Korea, to focus on growingmarkets such as China and India. PTT joined an increasingly crowded race: at least fourretailers from Europe and Asia have put in first-round bids. "We have already submitted a bid for the first round. Weare waiting for the next round," Chief Executive PrasertBunsumpun told reporters. PTT is participating through its retail subsidiary, PTTRetail Marketing Co. Ltd, which runs Jiffy convenience storesat its gas stations, and this was part of a plan to expand itsretail business, Prasert said. "If we got Carrefour's assets, it would make our retailbusiness bigger and our bargaining power will rise," he said. PTT, which has almost 1,300 gas stations around Thailand,could seek partners to join forces in the retail business ifthe Carrefour bid succeeded, Prasert said, without giving moredetails. PTT, Thailand's top listed company with a market value of$27 billion, has hired Bangkok-based investment bank QuantGroup to advise on the bid, a source at PTT told Reuters. PTT, which already has a partnership with CP ALL Pcl,allowing it to open 7-Eleven convenience stores by its gasstations, is also looking for assets overseas to boost growthand bolster its presence in international markets. PLENTY OF BIDDERS The race for Carrefour's assets in Southeast Asia has drawnin France's Casino Guichard Perrachon SA and Britain's TescoPlc as well as regional players like Dairy Farm, which runsGiant and Cold Storage chains in Southeast Asia, sources havesaid. Japan's second-biggest retail group, Aeon, has also thrownits hat into the ring, sources said last week. Leading Thai conglomerate Berli Jucker Pcl, owned by liquortycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhadi, expressed interest last monthin bidding for all the Southeast Asian operations. Thai media has reported that unlisted Central Group,Thailand's largest retail group, controlled by the Chirathivatfamily, was also keen to bid for the assets, with MorganStanley as adviser. Central Group declined to comment. In Thailand, Carrefour has a market share of around 2percent, behind CP All, Tesco and Big C Supercenter, part-ownedby Casino, which are the top three retailers, according to arecent RBS research note. Carrefour has 626 stores in Asia, with 424 in China alone.Of the rest, Indonesia has 76, Taiwan 65, Malaysia 19,Singapore two and Thailand 40, including 39 hypermarkets.
