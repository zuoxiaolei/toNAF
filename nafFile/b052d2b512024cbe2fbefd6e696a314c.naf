<raw><![CDATA[   (Corrects first paragraph to make clear U.S. official wasresponding to Airbus, not confirming detail of report) WASHINGTON, March 23 (Reuters) - A U.S. trade officialdisputed Airbus' assertion that a World Trade Organizationruling on Tuesday has no relevance to future Europeangovernment funding for the plane manufacturer's aircraft. "Certainly, reasoning and conclusions in the final reportcould be expected to be relevant to the WTO-consistency oflaunch aid for the A350," Carol Guthrie, a spokeswoman for theU.S. Trade Representative's office said. She was responding to an Airbus statement earlier onTuesday that the still confidential WTO ruling did not affectfuture funding for the A350, its next model of aircraft. "The WTO dispute directly addresses only the subsidies thatthe United States identified in its panel request in 2005,"Guthrie said. "Therefore one would not expect the commitments of launchaid to the A350 announced last summer and in recent days to beaddressed explicitly in the final report," she added.(Reporting by Doug Palmer; Editing by Stacey Joyce)             ]]></raw>
