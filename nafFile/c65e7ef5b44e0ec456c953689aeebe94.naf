Monetary policy is working its way through the economy. Growth is picking up. And inflation expectations have recovered from their trough," he said.The pound turned lower, with GBP/USD down 0.41% to 1.5593.The U.K. Office for National Statistics earlier reported that public sector net borrowing rose by £6.04 billion in April, compared to expectations for an increase of £7.80 billion.Elsewhere, the dollar turned higher against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY up 0.30% to 121.40 and with USD/CHF rising 0.22% to 0.9390.At its monthly policy meeting on Friday, the Bank of Japan kept its monetary policy on hold and signaled growing confidence in the strength of the economy.The Australian and New Zealand dollars were weaker, with AUD/USD down 0.75% to 0.7835 and NZD/USD sliding 0.40% to 0.7319.Meanwhile, USD/CAD climbed 0.56% to trade at 1.2269 after Statistics Canada reported that retail sales increased by 0.7% in March, beating expectations for a 0.3% rise.
