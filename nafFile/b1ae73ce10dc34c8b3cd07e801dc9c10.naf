<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen drops more than 3 pct vs dollar to 81.50 * G7 agrees on joint intervention on March 18 * BOJ to keep intervetion unsterilised, pumps liquidity * More intervention expected if USD/JPY falls towards 80 By Hideyuki Sano and Ian Chua	 TOKYO/SYDNEY, March 18 (Reuters) - The yen tumbled more than3 percent on Friday after Group of Seven finance ministersagreed to immediately and jointly intervene against the Japanesecurrency's surge to a record peak, with Bank of Japan buyingpushing the dollar above 81 yen.	 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Japan agreedwith central banks of the United States, Britain and Canada aswell as the European Central Bank to jointly intervene in thecurrency market. Markets were caught off guard by the firstjoint action in over a decade, expecting Japan to have to actalone.	 Traders said the Bank of Japan was immediately spottedbuying dollars versus the yen, though it seemed to be meetingheavy offers. Each respective central bank agreed to interveneand sell the yen when their respective markets open.	 Market players expected Japan and other central banks tokeep intervening if the dollar threatened to fall back below 80yen and make a run at the 76.25 all-time low struck this week.  The G7 has long warned against excessive volatility in exchangerates.	 But many traders were expected to need to unload dollars athigher levels and slow any advance, especially after Thursday'sshocking plunge in dollar/yen that saw it collapse more than 4percent in just an hour.	 "It is a positive surprise," said Mitsuru Sahara, chief FXmanager at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi-UFJ in Tokyo.	 "The impact will be there, as it is difficult now to sellthe dollar below 80 yen ... I think it is aimed at preventing asharp plunge and bringing dollar/yen back up to levels before itstarted plunging, rather than trying to push it higher above 85yen. I don't expect follow-up interventions to the upside."	 The dollar's gains slowed after the initial burst higher,with Japanese exporters and traders stuck with long yenpositions using the opportunity to unload. Some individualJapanese margin traders were also spotted selling dollars.	 The rare G7 joint intervention capped a frantic week forJapanese markets that saw the Nikkei suffer its worsttwo-day rout since the 1987 crash and the yen soaring asinvestors watched the country's nuclear crisis escalate.	 The dollar jumped 3.3 percent on the day to as high as 81.50yen on trading platform EBS, extending a rebound from arecord low of 76.25 yen plumbed on Thursday.	 The sell off in the previous session came after a break ofthe 1995 record low of 79.75 triggered a cascade of automaticsell orders, some tied to leveraged positions and structured FXderivatives, in thin trade between the U.S. and Asian tradingdays.	 The yen has climbed steadily since last week's earthquake,as Japanese and international investors closed long positions inhigher-yielding, riskier assets such as the Australian dollar,funded by cheap borrowing in the Japanese currency. 	Expectations that Japanese insurers and companies will bringmoney home to pay for claims and reconstruction also contributedto the yen's strength.	 	 The euro jumped 3.5 percent to 114.60 yen ,boosted in part by comments from Japanese Finance MinisterYoshihiko Noda that the European Central Bank may intervene ineuro/yen. 	 Commodity currencies, such as the Australian dollar,performed even better and recovered a bit from their recenthammering.	 The Aussie surged 4.2 percent to 80.75 yen andwas up 1 percent against the dollar at $0.9916 .	  WILL INTERVENTION BE SUCCESSFUL?	 Some analysts doubted any intervention would be effective,given past experiences by the Bank of Japan and the SwissNational Bank.	 "Intervention is no panacea. Everyone knows it. Japan has amuch bigger credibility problem and that'll weaken the impact,"said David Gilmore, a partner in FX Analytics in Essex,Connecticut.	 "I don't think we've seen the low in the dollar/yen. There'sstill a lot of carry trade exposure. The world is really leveredup on this."	 Other analysts said intervention may be more effective thistime than it was in September when Japan spent $26 billion toweaken the yen but failed to ensure a lasting dollar rally. 	The cost of hedging against a further yen rise fell, withimplied volatility on one-month dollar/yen options trading at around 16 percent, down from near 21 percent onThursday and showing the market calming a bit.	 Views that ECB was likely to lift interest rates soon alsohelped underpinned the common currency, which last stood at$1.4070 and was poised to make a run at the November 2010peak and chart resistance near $1.4280.	 The dollar bounced off a record low of 0.8852 Swiss francs and was up 1 percent at 0.9065 francs. The franc hadbenefited from the recent market turmoil as it is usually seen asafe port in a storm.	 The franc had earlier edged up after the U.N SecurityCouncil voted to authorise a no-fly zone over Libya, promptingfurther gains in oil prices.
