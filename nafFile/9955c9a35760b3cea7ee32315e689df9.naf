<raw><![CDATA[ * Foreign investors look again at Ukraine post-elections * Global interest in local debt set to revive * Eurobond issue seen in second half  By Sebastian Tong LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - After months of fretting aboutsovereign default, foreign investors are giving Ukraine a secondlook, with some arguing that asset prices don't fully reflectthe promise of political stability. The domestic debt market where international participationhas virtually dried up in the last two years could be the nextbeneficiary of renewed investor interest which has alreadypushed Ukraine's foreign bond prices higher and yields lower. Despite a severe 15-percent contraction last year, Ukraine'seconomic prospects are seen improving following the mid-Februaryelection of President Viktor Yanukovich. "This is most likely the best political landscape we've hadin some time," said Jeremy Brewin, emerging debt fund manager atAviva Investors. Yanukovich's election has kindled hopes for an end to thepolitical feuding that has paralysed national decision-makingfor years, culminating in November when the InternationalMonetary Fund suspended its $16.4-billion aid programme. The new president, who has promised to heal bilateralrelations with major trade partner Russia, this week formed anew coalition expected to work on a new 2010 budget that willmeet the conditions of its multilateral lenders. Yields on Ukraine's dollar bond maturing 2013 are at theirlowest in nearly 20 months as investors shrug off lingeringdoubts over the country's ability to service its debt. State-controlled firms such as utility provider Naftogaz,railway company Ukrzalyznitsya and telco Ukrtelekom are amongthose that have entered restructuring talks with theircreditors. Senior officials have warned that the IMF may not return toprop up state finances until the second half of the year andthat the country needs to find $3-5 billion per quarter for itsbudget requirements.  On Thursday, newly appointed Prime Minister Mykola Azarovpledged cooperation with the IMF, warning that state cofferswere empty and the country had to repay $5.5 billion in domesticdebt by the end of this year.  GO LOCAL? Analysts say that Ukraine's refinancing schedule for itsforeign currency sovereign debt is relatively light. A Japanese yen-denominated bond is due in December and adollar bond matures next March but following these, no foreignbond repayment is due until mid-2012. Even without the IMF, RBS head of emerging markets researchTimothy Ash notes that Ukraine's sovereign debt obligations thisyear are manageable given its US$26 billion foreign exchangereserves and $2.5 billion fiscal reserves. The cost of insuring Ukrainian sovereign debt has reflectedthis, with five-year credit default swaps falling to around 770bps compared with an all-time peak of 5,545 bps a year ago. Despite the increasing volume of Ukraine's short-termdomestic debt and widening yields, "the chances of a domesticdebt default are low because Ukrainian banks are pretty liquidand will continue to buy local currency debt issued by the statethat is offering yields of around 20 percent," Ash said. On Tuesday, Ukraine repaid in full and on time maturingtreasury bills worth 596 million hryvnias ($75 million). Local currency debt could start looking more attractive tooffshore investors after the rally in Ukraine's foreign bonds. Before the global financial crisis, non-resident holders ofdomestic securities accounted for nearly quarter of the market.A mere 0.7 percent of local government debt issued was bought byoffshore investors last year, but latest central bank figuresshow non-residents holding 1.3 percent of government securitiesissued in the year to date. "There should be further pick-up in foreign interest," saidUniCredit analyst Dmitry Gourov in Vienna, recommending localcurrency government debt and short positions on dollar/hryvnianon-deliverable forwards in anticipation of an  appreciation inthe spot rate. "Restored confidence is likely to move the dollar/hryvniaNDFs lower, thus NDFs at current levels should present a goodopportunity with six-month/nine-month/12-month maturitiesimplying around 10 percent yields," he said. The central bank -- which has been intervening to stop theexchange rate strengthening below 7.98 to the dollar -- islikely to allow the currency to appreciate further after IMFfunds are unlocked. The resumption of the IMF programme coupled with benignglobal market conditions and newfound domestic politicalstability is also seen setting the stage for Ukraine to issueits first sovereign Eurobond since 2007. In January, Kiev said it had begun talks with foreign banksin the hope of obtaining a bilateral loan or selling a publiclytraded bond by May. "Most managers are probably overweight their benchmark inUkraine (foreign bonds) ... But if Ukraine came out with a newdebt issue now, it would probably do quite well," said NickBrown, emerging debt manager at Schroders.
