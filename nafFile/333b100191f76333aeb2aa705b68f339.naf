<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro was higher against the pound on Monday, as sentiment on sterling was hit by fears that weak economic data this week could prompt the Bank of England to implement more easing measures to spur growth.EUR/GBP hit 0.7868 during European afternoon trade, the session high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.7867, gaining 0.43%.The pair was likely to find support at 0.7828, Friday’s low and a six-day low and resistance at 0.7900, the high of August 8.The pound found support last week after BoE Governor Mervyn King indicated that the central bank was unlikely to cut rates soon, saying it would be counterproductive.But the outlook for sterling deteriorated after the BoE said that the U.K. economy would barely grow this year and cut its forecasts for the coming years in Wednesday’s quarterly inflation report.The U.K. was to release data on retail sales, employment and inflation later in the week, while the BoE was to publish the minutes of its August policy meeting, which could indicate how soon more easing measures may be introduced.Meanwhile, sentiment on the euro was boosted after official data showed that Greece’s economy contracted less than expected in the second quarter.Official data showed that Greek gross domestic product contracted by 6.2% in the three months to June, less than the 7.0% contraction forecast by economists and slightly less than the 6.5% contraction seen in the first quarter.Elsewhere, Italy saw borrowing costs rise only slightly after it auctioned EUR8 billion of 12-month government bonds at an average yield of 1.69%, up from 1.55% previously.The pound edged higher against the U.S. dollar, with GBP/USD easing up 0.09% to 1.5701.Trade looked likely to remain subdued on Monday, with no significant economic data releases on the calendar, while volumes were light with many market participants on summer holidays.                        ]]></raw>
