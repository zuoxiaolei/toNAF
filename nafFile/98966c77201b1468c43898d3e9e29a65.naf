<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar index inches higher, euro cedes more ground * Market awaits a host of Fed speakers for clues on QE  (Updates prices; changes byline, dateline; previous TOKYO) By Anirban Nag LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The dollar gained against abasket of currencies on Tuesday, backed by worries among someplayers that the monetary easing expected from the U.S. FederalReserve next month is already largely priced in. U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's comment that theUnited States would not engage in dollar devaluation and neededto work hard to preserve confidence in a strong dollar, alsooffered some support to the ailing greenback. "Comments from Geithner and a reversal in short dollarpositions is pushing it higher," said Gareth Berry, currencystrategist at UBS, Singapore. "But this will not last too longwith many waiting to see what the Fed will do next month." Investors have been selling the dollar for weeks onexpectations the Federal Reserve will decide to pump more cashinto the U.S. economy at its Nov. 2-3 meeting.  But currencies like the euro and the Australian dollar thathad broken higher ground against the dollar are giving up someof those gains -- suggesting markets think much of the trade isdone. But the market still has to wait and see how sizeable the QEwill actually be. Until then, traders and analysts saidshort-term players were simply flipping positions within tightranges. The dollar index firmed 0.5 percent to 77.34. Technicalanalysts say it needs to extend above its Oct. 12 high of 77.93to signal a short-term bottom is in place after Friday's10-month trough of 76.144. A host of speakers from the Fed are due to speak on Tuesday.More and more policymakers are signing up for QE, so anyindications on how far the U.S. central bank will go tostimulate the economy could weigh on the dollar. Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, is scheduled to give briefremarks while New York Fed President William Dudley, Chicago Fedchief Charles Evans, Atlanta Fed chief Dennis Lockhart,Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota and Dallas FedPresident Richard Fisher are expected to speak later in the day.  G20 EFFORTS Analysts said Geithner's comments on the U.S. dollar aheadof the G-20 meeting meant the U.S. was probably trying to workout an agreement with emerging economies which would ease thecurrency tensions that have marked the past few weeks. "We are seeing the U.S. give up some ground as his commentsindicate that QE may be a gradualist approach and Asianeconomies need not worry too much about a falling dollar," saidIan Stannard, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas. "A gradual approach to QE will have a less impact on thedollar." A number of Asian and emerging countries have stepped upintervention or imposed capital controls to stem a rapidappreciation in their currencies against the dollar which manyfeel can harm exports. The euro dipped 0.24 percent to $1.3912, well below Friday'seight-month high, with investors awaiting the influential GermanZEW survey for October. The euro has so far failed to clear $1.4000 again sinceFriday's surge above $1.4100. This was seen by some as a warningthat more long euro/short dollar positions could unwind, withthe euro's Oct. 12 low of $1.3775 seen as a possible target. The dollar edged up 0.12 percent against the yen to 81.35yen, creeping further away from a 15-year low of 80.88 hit lastweek and a record low of 79.75 set in 1995. Earlier in the day, there was talk of dollar selling byJapanese exporters at levels near 81.30 yen. The Australian dollar fell 0.13 percent to $0.9885, paringearlier losses after the Reserve Bank of Australia's minutesfrom its Oct. 5 meeting said the arguments to hold or hike rateswere finely balanced.
