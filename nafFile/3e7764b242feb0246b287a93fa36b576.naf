<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar hit session highs against the other major currencies on Tuesday after data showed that U.S. core retail sales rose at the fastest pace in seven months in July.  During European afternoon trade, the dollar extended gains against the yen, with USD/JPY advancing 1.33% to 98.18.The Commerce Department said core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, rose 0.5% in July, compared to forecasts for a 0.4% increase.Core retail sales for June were revised up to 0.1% from a flat reading.Overall retail sales rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% last month, missing expectations for a 0.3% increase. Retail sales figures for June were revised up to a 0.6% gain from a previously reported increase of 0.4% the report said.The data reinforced the view that the economic recovery is strong enough for the Federal Reserve to begin phasing out its asset purchase program later this year.The yen weakened across the board earlier Tuesday following reports that Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is looking at lowering the corporate tax rate as a way to offset a planned increase in sales tax.Elsewhere, the dollar hit one-week highs against the euro, with EUR/USD down 0.26% to 1.3267.
