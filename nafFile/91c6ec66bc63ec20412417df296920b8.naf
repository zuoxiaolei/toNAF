<raw><![CDATA[ * GPIF holds $1.4 trln in assets, two-thirds in JGBs * Japan debt woes face reckoning in 5-10 yrs if unresolved * Hopes to start investment in emerging markets in 2011/12 * Investments in emerging markets unlikely to be large (Recasts, adds more Mitani comment and market reaction)	 By Chikafumi Hodo and Hiroyasu Hoshi	 TOKYO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Japan's $1.4 trillion statepension fund called on the government to rein in the nation'sburgeoning debt, saying it could reach a critical point as earlyas 2016 if it was not tackled.	 Japan's struggle to control its bulging public debt -- thelargest among developed countries at double the size of its $5trillion economy -- prompted Moody's this week to warn it couldcut the country's credit rating.	 "We want the government to cope with the debt problem,"Takahiro Mitani, chairman of the Government Pension InvestmentFund (GPIF), the world's biggest pension fund, told Reuters inan interview.	 "If (the government) leaves the (debt) situation as it is,then at some point in five to 10 years, it will reach a crucialpoint," Mitani said.	 The GPIF, whose assets are larger than both the Canadian andIndian economies, is a major force in the Japanese governmentbond (JGB) market, where it places two-thirds of its investment.	 Moody's Investors Service cut the outlook on Japan's Aa2sovereign rating to negative from stable on Tuesday, warningthat government policies may be insufficient to rein in thecountry's public debt.	 In January, Standard & Poor's downgraded Japan's creditrating for the first time since 2002, saying Tokyo lacked acoherent strategy for dealing with the debt pile.	 It said an ageing population, persistent deflation and thegovernment's loss of power in parliament compounded its fiscalchallenge.	   POLITICAL MEASURES	 Mitani did not elaborate on what might happen if thegovernment failed to resolve the debt issue.	 But he said he was not sure if Prime Minister Naoto Kan'sDemocratic Party of Japan (DPJ) will be able to come up with draft plans on tax and social welfare reforms by June as he haspromised.	 However, Mitani hoped some kind of political measures toresolve the country's debt problem would take place over thenext two to three years.	 As the head of a public pension fund, Mitani has to becareful about what he says about government policy, bond marketparticipants said. In addition, alarmist comments could backfire on the fund's own investments, they said.	 "Big holders of JGBs such as the GPIF, otherspension funds and banks cannot give the slightest hint that theycould sell JGBs if the debt problem is not fixed as that wouldkill themselves too," said a strategist at a Japanese assetmanagement company, who spoke on condition of anonymity.	 "The consequences for Japan for not resolving the debtproblem would be quite similar to what we are seeing in Greece-- hike taxes, cut pension payments and cut socialexpenditures."	 JGB prices climbed on Wednesday as tensions in the MiddleEast prompted safe-haven buying from investors. The 10-yearyield fell to a three-week low. 	  GRADUAL MOVE INTO EMERGING MARKETS	 Kan, who took office only last June, has staked his careeron fiscal reforms.	 But the opposition has refused to join talks on the issueand instead is piling pressure on the unpopular leader to call asnap election by threatening to block budget related bills.	 Japan's debt started to swell in the 1990s as the countrytried to revive its fortunes after a property bubble burst.However, fear of default is muted because Japan can draw onmassive public savings, unlike the United States which reliesheavily on foreigners to finance its debt.	 Mitani said investors were not making decisions based on theactions of credit rating companies. "Rather, they are watchingoverall fund flows into JGBs to make their decisions," he said.	 Indeed, he said GPIF was not planning to change its basicportfolio as a result of the actions by the credit ratingcompanies.	 But the fund aims to diversify its portfolio by investing inemerging markets, where it hopes to start channelling funds inthe financial year that starts in April, the chairman said.	 The fund's investments in emerging markets would be gradualand the initial amount would be small, he said. The fund hadflagged this move last year. 	 The fund has completed its first round of screening to pickfund managers for the emerging market investments, Mitani said.The selection selection process could take about a year.	 "We want to take more time and we want to be more selectivein choosing managers."	 The GPIF, which invests the reserves of national andcorporate pension plans, held total assets of 117.6 trillion yenas of September.	 It suffered a loss of 1.5 percent on its investments in thesix-month period to September, compared with a 7.91 percent gainfor the whole financial year that ended last March.	 The fund's performance up until September lagged other majoroverseas counterparts, such as California Public Employees'Retirement System (Calpers), which posted a return of 3 percent,while the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board produced a biggerreturn of 5.2 percent.	 Besides Japanese government bonds, the fund also hasinvestments in domestic shares, foreign bonds and foreignequities. As of September, more than 9 percent of the GPIF'stotal assets were in foreign equities.
