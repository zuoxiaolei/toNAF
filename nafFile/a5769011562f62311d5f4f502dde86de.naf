The pair was likely to find support at 0.9306, the low of May 3 and resistance at 0.9398, the high of May 6.  German industrial output jumped 1.2% in March data on Wednesday showed, confounding expectations for a 0.1% decline. The data fuelled optimism over the outlook for first quarter growth in the euro zone’s largest economy after Germany’s gross domestic product contracted by 0.5% in the three months to December.The data also dampened speculation over the possibility of further rate cuts by the ECB after the bank indicated Monday that further rate cuts were possible.   The Swissie was higher against the euro with EUR/CHF slipping 0.14%, to hit 1.2288.   Later in the day, the U.S. was to release official data on initial jobless claims.             ]]></raw>
