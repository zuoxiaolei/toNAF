<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – Last week saw the euro decline against the U.S. dollar for the second consecutive week, as ongoing fears over sovereign debt contagion in euro zone outweighed concerns over a possible U.S. sovereign debt default.  EUR/USD hit 1.3837 on Tuesday, the pair’s lowest since March 11; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4153 by close of trade on Friday, shedding 0.35% over the week.  The pair was likely to find support at 1.3950, Wednesday’s low and resistance at 1.4281, Thursday’s high. The euro fell on Tuesday after Ireland became the third euro zone member to have its sovereign debt rating cut to junk status, following a downgrade by ratings agency Moody’s, citing the probability that the country will need an additional bailout.Greece’s credit rating was cut three levels by ratings agency Fitch on Thursday to its lowest grade for any country in the world, saying that a default was a “real possibility.” Fears that the region’s debt crisis would spill over to Italy saw the cost of insuring Italian government debt against default rise to a euro lifetime high. Results from the European Banking Authority stress-tests published Friday showed that eight banks out of the region’s 90 top lenders failed the test, with a combined capital shortfall of EUR2.5 billion. The EBA said 16 banks narrowly passed the stress tests. Of the banks that failed the tests, five were in Spain, two in Greece and one in Austria, while all of the region’s biggest firms passed the test. Meanwhile, Standard & Poor’s said late Thursday that the U.S. faced a 50% chance of a credit rating downgrade within the next 90 days, citing the political debate over raising the country’s USD14.3 trillion debt ceiling before the August 2 deadline.The warning came a day after rival Moody's Investors Service said it put the U.S. government’s Aaa bond rating on review for possible downgrade due to a “small but rising risk” of a short-lived default.Data on Friday showed that manufacturing activity in the New York-region unexpectedly contracted for a second month in July, while U.S. consumer sentiment in early July fell to its lowest since March 2009.A separate report showed that U.S. industrial production rose less-than-expected in June, while consumer prices for June advanced 0.3%, above expectations for a 0.2% gain. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress on Wednesday that the central bank was examining several untested means to stimulate growth if conditions deteriorate, including another round of asset purchases or quantitative easing.However, in the second part of his congressional testimony on Thursday Bernanke said that that inflation was “higher” and “closer” to the central bank’s informal target than was the case in August 2010, dampening speculation the Fed will take additional action to spur the economy.In the week ahead, euro zone finance ministers are to meet Thursday to focus on “the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and the future financing of the Greek program,” according to the president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy.Markets will also be paying close attention to any developments in regards to the U.S. debt ceiling talks as well as a congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.Monday, July 18The U.S. is to publish a government report on the balance of domestic and foreign investments.Tuesday, July 19In the euro zone, the ZEW Centre for Economic Research is to publish a report on German economic sentiment, a leading indicator of economic health.
