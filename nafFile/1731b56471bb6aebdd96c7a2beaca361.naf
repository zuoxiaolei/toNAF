<raw><![CDATA[ LISBON, May 10 (Reuters) - With their bonds strengtheningafter the announcement of a $1 trillion financial safety net forthe euro zone, even the weakest states other than Greece may notneed to use the net, officials and analysts say. [ID:nSGE6490HH] Countries are reluctant to apply for emergency aid partlybecause it would come with tough requirements to imposeausterity measures, similar to those demanded in theInternational Monetary Fund's bailout programmes. Here is the outlook for Portugal, Ireland and Spain, thethree countries which many analysts see as the next potential"dominoes" after Greece.PORTUGAL Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos said inBrussels on Sunday night that it would be premature to decidewhether Portugal would need to apply for emergency funds. Commerzbank economist Ralph Solveen said, "I wouldn't saythe probability of Portugal needing to apply for the safety netis high. If the ECB's bond buying is successful and it calmsdown the markets, I'd say it's lower than 50 percent. "The ECB is buying bonds and the pockets of the ECB are verydeep. Perhaps they will not need the bailout after all."  Moody's Investors Service last week put Portugal's Aa2rating on a three-month review for a possible downgrade, butsaid that though Portugal's financing costs might rise for sometime because of market pressures, it expected debt servicing to"remain very affordable in the near to medium term".  It said "the government's debt is neither unsustainable norunbearable." Diego Iscaro, economist at IHS Global Insight in London,said: "I don't think Portugal has liquidity problems, so theneed to apply is surely below 50 percent. All depends on howthis aid will materialise, but I'd say the probability is about20 percent in a 12-month horizon." He added, "If they choose aid at IMF terms, I think therewill be a lot of opposition, especially from the people, sincethe economy is already performing poorly and unemployment is onthe rise." But Antonio Costa Pinto, a political scientist in Lisbon,said that if the government did apply for the safety net, itsplan would probably be accepted by parliament, where the mainopposition party is on the centre-right of the spectrum. "There will be some social polarisation, but from theexample of our direct agreements with the IMF in 1979 and 1983,which had very tough conditions, I don't expect too muchopposition. The levels of social conflict in Portugal arerelatively low."  Portugal's budget deficit is expected to drop from 9.4percent of gross domestic product in 2009 to 8.5 percent thisyear and 7.9 percent in 2011, the European Commission forecastthis month. Gross government debt is predicted to rise from 76.8percent to 85.8 percent and 91.1 percent. [ID:nBRQ009230][ID:nBRQ009831]  IRELAND Ireland has no immediate funding problems and sees no needto use the safety net, the Finance Ministry said on Monday. Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said his country's fiscalposition was not questioned at the meeting of euro zone financeministers on Sunday. "There's no suggestion that any state other than Greece hasfunding difficulties...There were no suggestions in the meetingthat Ireland has any difficulties whatsoever," Lenihan toldnational radio RTE, adding that he was under no pressure to drawup an early budget. Ireland could continue borrowing at current market rateswithout seriously damaging its finances until the first half of2011, according to Alan McQuaid, chief economist at BloxhamStockbrokers. Asked about the chances of Ireland applying for a bailout inthe next 12 months, he said: "I would have it relatively low.Obviously it depends on global conditions, but I would have itrelatively low, 25-30 percent." McQuaid said there was a recognition among public sectorworkers that they did not want to go down the Greek route. "I think there is an element, and you can see it here withthe public service unions and union leaders, there is arecognition that you don't want to go down the step where youhave to need recourse to the IMF." Retail sales, jobless, budget and Purchasing Managers Indexdata last week offered signs that Ireland might be about to exitthe euro zone's longest running recession. "Last week was the best week for a long time on the Irisheconomy data front," Brian Devine, economist at NCBStockbrokers, said in a note. "The worry was that financialcontagion would spread and harm the recovery. The EU bailoutshould ensure that this does not occur." Ireland's budget deficit is due to shrink from 14.3 percentof GDP last year to 11.7 percent this year, but edge up to 12.1percent next year, according to the EC. Its government debt/GDPratio is expected to rise from 64.0 percent last year to 77.3percent this year and 87.3 percent next year.  SPAIN Spain says it has the necessary financing and access tocapital sources to avoid having to use the safety net. "The Spanish government will not have to use this measure atall; Spain's deputy prime minister (and economy minister) ElenaSalgado was very clear about that yesterday," a spokesman forthe economy ministry said. Many analysts agree. "The pressure on Spain's financingcosts is not enough to trigger this aid mechanism. Portugal'ssituation is more compromising, but the approval of the measuresdissipates the tension," said Sara Balinas from AnalistasFinancieras Internacionales. The existence of the safety net should be enough to bolstermarkets and this, combined with fresh cuts in the budget deficitannounced on Monday, should make any use of emergency fundingless likely, BNP analyst Luigi Speranza said. [ID:nMDT009015] "The fact that the money is available is having a hugeimpact on the market today; this in itself reduces the chancesthat Spain will have to tap the extra financing." He added, "There has been considerable commitment frominstitutions including the ECB. Now it's really important to seehow markets take it...at the moment they are taking it verywell." Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is expected togive more details on the new deficit cuts -- which would bringthe deficit to 9.3 percent of GDP in 2010 and 6.5 percent in2011 -- when he appears before parliament on Wednesday. Lastyear the deficit was 11.2 percent. Spain's debt/GDP ratio is expected to climb from 53.2percent last year to 64.9 percent this year and 72.5 percentnext year, the EC said last week, before the announcement of thenew deficit targets.
