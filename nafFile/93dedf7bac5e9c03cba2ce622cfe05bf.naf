<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen steady vs dollar, investors wary of more yen selling * Euro at 1-month high vs dollar, yen after Spain auction * Swiss franc weakens broadly after SNB meeting(Adds comment, updates prices) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The yen edged higher againstthe U.S. dollar on Thursday with the Bank of Japan staying outof currency markets after their massive yen-selling operationthe previous day, but wariness about fresh selling cappedgains. The euro rose to its highest in more than a month againstthe dollar and the yen after strong demand at a Spanish bondauction reinforced confidence in Europe. Japan sold an estimated 1.8 trillion yen ($21.14 billion)for dollars on Wednesday, a record for a single day, in a bidto help its exporters and increase its money supply to counterdeflation. Japan's first currency intervention in six yearsknocked the yen from a 15-year high versus the dollar, but theyen's six month uptrend did not look to be convincingly broken."Things have been quiet on the intervention front so fartoday. Clients are hesitant at this point to touch dollar/yenin either direction," said Amelia Bourdeau, senior currencystrategist at UBS AG in Stamford, Connecticut. "Investors need more information. They have to watchdollar/yen for another week or two just to see the frequencywith which they come in to the market and the size (ofintervention)," she added. Prime Minister Naoto Kan reiterated on Thursday Japan wouldtake decisive steps on yen strength, Jiji news agency reported,while Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said he expectedintervention would stabilize the forex market. [ID:nTKF107009] In mid-morning trading, the dollar was down 0.1 percentagainst the yen  at 85.62 yen, but well up on 82.87 yenhit on electronic trading platform EBS on Wednesday. Investorssaid a fall under 85.00 may prompt Japan to re-enter themarket. The dollar earlier hit a session high of 85.84 yen onelectronic trading platform EBS after stops were triggered at85.80 yen. Traders said there were no signs of yen-selling byJapanese authorities. "There's no sign of the Bank of Japan this morning yet onmarkets, but they were successful yesterday and we arebeginning to see some funds moving in the same direction,unwinding long yen positions," said Greg Salvaggio, vicepresident of trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington. Headded investors should look out for stops at 86.10 yen. Analysts said the dollar's upside may be capped around85.83 yen, where a trendline from the dollar's highs in May andJune falls, and 85.95 yen, the 55-day moving average. Others said Japanese authorities may have a hard timefighting the yen's strength, given narrow yield spreads betweenJapanese and U.S. government bonds. "It is almost inevitable that the Japanese authorities willhave to continue intervention heading into year end withUSD/JPY likely to remain under downward pressure as the U.S.economy slows and the Fed moves towards renewed monetaryeasing," said Lee Hardman, currency economist at The Bank kofTokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London. "From an operationalstandpoint, there is still plenty of scope for furtherintervention."For Breakingviews on Janan's yen intervention [ID:nLDE68E0JD]For dollar/yen correlations  http://link.reuters.com/wyn43p    For graphic on intervention  http://link.reuters.com/wym42pFor Insider on yen           http://link.reuters.com/rak63p^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Market participants said dollar selling by some Japaneseexporters pushed the U.S. currency off Wednesday's high of85.78 yen hit on electronic trading platform EBS.

SPANISH BOND SALE The euro  rallied 0.7 percent to $1.3098 after risingto $1.3117 according to Reuters data, its highest since Aug.11, after auctions of 10- and 30-year Spanish government bondsproduced lower average yields than at a previous sale in June.[ID:nLDE68F0QX] "The Spanish bond auction went very well and that's removedsome of the debt risks attached to the euro," said ChrisTurner, head of fx strategy at ING.
