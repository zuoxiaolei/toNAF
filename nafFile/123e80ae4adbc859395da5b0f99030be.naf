<raw><![CDATA[ LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew almosttwice as fast as expected in the second quarter of this year,buoyed by a sharp pick-up in services output and the fastestrise in construction output in almost 50 years, official datashowed on Friday. The Office for National Statistics said gross domesticproduct jumped 1.1 percent on the quarter, the fastest rise infour years, and rose by 1.6 percent on the year -- the highestin two years. The figures, which were well above even the highestforecasts in a Reuters poll, may raise doubts over how long theBank of England will keep interest rates at their record low,particularly with inflation running so far above target. Britain's services sector enjoyed its fastest growth inthree years, expanding by 0.9 percent on the quarter -- threetimes as fast as in Q1 and contributing 0.7 percentage points togrowth. Manufacturing grew 1.6 percent, its biggest rise in morethan 10 years. Construction, meanwhile, leapt by 6.6 percent on the quarter-- its fastest rate since 1963. The construction data was basedfor the first time on a new monthly survey, rather thanestimates which used to be used at this stage. The ONS said the rebound in construction output in Q2 cameafter a fall of 1.6 percent in Q1 which was due to the poorweather. Construction output contributed 0.4 percentage pointsto growth between April and June.             ]]></raw>
