<raw><![CDATA[ * High inflation not due solely to one-off shocks * Confident can bring down inflation if economy growing well * If UK faces deflationary shock, will do more QE  (Adds quotes, context) LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - Bank of England policymaker AdamPosen said on Wednesday he does not agree with the view held byGovernor Mervyn King that Britain's high inflation is almostwholly caused by temporary factors. Inflation has been significantly above the central bank's 2percent target since December, hitting a 17-month high of 3.7percent in April, although it eased slightly in May. King attributes the pick-up in price pressures to changes invalue-added tax, volatile oil prices and the past depreciationof sterling and says the effect will fade as slack in theeconomy will bear down on prices. "The only place where I would point to or acknowledge adirect difference with the Governor is this issue of how much,looking backwards, you want to say that this was just a seriesof one-time shocks, where I think he has been pretty clear up tonow saying that has been the case," Posen said at an economicconference in London. "That is why we have nine members on the committee. And atsome point the committee makes a decision," he told the Societyof Business Economists. In a speech earlier, Posen had said that above-targetinflation had probably been due to a modest "unanchoring" ofinflation expectations, but that this was not sufficient groundsto tighten policy when there were strong downward risks fromfiscal austerity, especially in the euro zone. If demand from the United States and emerging economies wasenough to outweigh euro zone weakness, and inflationexpectations remained above target, Posen was sure the BoE couldrapidly tackle the latter problem. "If we end up overshooting inflation because we end uphappily in the good (growth) outcome, then I am very confidentwe can bring it back down. We know how to do that." Household inflation expectations had only risen so far onshort-term measures, and not on a five-year horizon, whilefinancial market measures of inflation expectations did not yetshow a strong rise, he added. The budgetary tightening announced by Britain's coalitiongovernment in its June emergency budget was roughly on the scaleexpected, but it was too early to draw exact conclusions aboutits impact, Posen added. Posen also said the central bank could restart itsquantitative easing programme to purchase assets if the UK faceda deflationary shock, though he could offer no guarantee that itwould prove fully effective. "Go to the Governor's Mansion House speech, go to DavidMiles's speech earlier this year. Both of them express a strongconviction, with strong theoretical arguments, as to why youcould continually expand QE without limit," he said. "Speaking personally for myself alone ... I'm a little bitmore humble about the capabilities of that policy. But that ismoot. If that is what we have available, and the shock isdeflationary, then that is what we use."
