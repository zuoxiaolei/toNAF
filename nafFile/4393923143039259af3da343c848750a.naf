<raw><![CDATA[ * Sept house prices +0.9 pct m/m, unchanged y/y - Nationwide * Sept construction PMI falls to 46.7 from 47.7 -CIPS/Markit * Homeowners repay 7.0 bln stg of mortgage debt in Q2 - BoE  By David Milliken and Kylie MacLellan LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - British house prices rose to theirhighest level in a year in September and there was the firstincrease in house-building in nearly two years, but this was notenough to stop an overall decline in construction activity. Moreover, economists warned that the recovery in houseprices from February's near five-year low was slowing and Bankof England figures showed existing homeowners repaid mortgagedebt at a near-record rate in the three months to June. Building society Nationwide said house prices rose 0.9percent in September, slightly better than economists' forecastsof 0.7 percent but less than August's 1.4 percent rise. September's gain left prices unchanged on the year -- thefirst time since March 2008 that prices have not declined on ayear-on-year basis. The average price of a British home is now161,816 pounds ($257,900) -- 13 percent below the peak inOctober 2007 but 10 percent up on February's level. Economists said support for the housing market was largelycoming from a lack of supply of new properties and the greateraffordability of those properties that are on the market. "To the extent that downside risks have eased and confidencehas improved it may be that prices are rising back to moreappropriate levels ... while still down significantly from thepeak," said Allan Monks, UK economist at JP Morgan. "If these arguments are correct, the strength of the recentprice gains is likely to loose some steam in due course," hesaid. Nationwide economist Martin Gahbauer said high unemploymentand restrictive credit conditions put a limit on how fast demandcould increase, meaning it was unlikely house prices wouldcontinue to increase at the strong rate seen in recent months. Economists also said higher prices would be likely toincrease supply, tempting back sellers who had been put off bysharp price falls earlier in the year.  CONSTRUCTION WEAK Construction activity slowed further in September, and at afaster pace than in August. Purchasing managers' data from Markit and the CharteredInstitute of Purchasing and Supply showed the headline PMI indexfell to 46.7, its lowest level since June. While the housing component showed its first growth for 22months, rising to 50.3 from 48.2, the pace of contraction incommercial property and civil engineering accelerated. "Though the industry is not contracting as quickly as it wasearlier in the year, firms are struggling to adjust tocomparatively low levels of activity, as reflected by employmentlevels which took another hefty hit and have droppedconsecutively for 16 months," said CIPS chief executive DavidNoble. Prospects for a consumer-led recovery also took a knock fromBank of England data which showed households paid down 7.0billion pounds worth of mortgage debt between April and June --only slightly less than the record 7.3 billion repaid in thefirst three months of the year. This amounted to 2.9 percent of post-tax income. "Housing equity withdrawal has been used significantly tosupport consumer spending in recent years. Consequently, thesharp turnaround from substantial withdrawals up to andincluding the first quarter of 2008 has added to the constraintson consumer spending," said IHS Global Insight's Howard Archer.  * For a graphic showing the Nationwide house price index andmortgage approvals, see:http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/109/UK_MTGNWI1009.gif    (Editing by Mike Peacock)             ]]></raw>
