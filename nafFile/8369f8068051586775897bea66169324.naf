<raw><![CDATA[ Position: Finance Minister Incumbent: Anders Borg, 42 Term: 2010 to September 2014. Borg was reappointed as theNordic country's finance minister in early October after theModerate Party-led government beat the centre-left opposition ina Sept. 19 general election, though it lost its house majoritydue to gains for the far-right. Key Facts:  -- Borg is the closest ally of Prime Minister FredrikReinfeldt and helped remodel the Moderate party after itsprevious period in power in the early 1990s when Sweden suffereda deep economic crisis. The two have moved the Moderates closer to the politicalcentre and toned down plans for radical cuts in taxes and thewelfare state. -- Under Borg's watch as finance minister, the governmenthas trimmed income taxes, abolished a wealth tax and introducedgreater incentives to get people back to work. The governmentalso embarked on Sweden's biggest-ever privatisation programme,which included the sale of Absolut Vodka maker Vin & Sprit, realestate firm Vasakronan and part of TeliaSonera. -- Borg, who sports a pony-tail and earring, was a surprisechoice as finance minister in 2006. He held onto his role afteradmitting shortly after the elections that he had failed todeclare payments to a nanny his family used. Two other cabinetmembers resigned over similar admissions. -- Borg gained recognition in Europe for his outspoken viewson regulation of the financial industry, especially of bankbonuses. He was widely quoted during the global recession assaying "the bankers are partying like it's 1999, and it's 2009". -- At home, Borg has been praised for introducing timelyfiscal measures to ease the effects of the downturn withoutjeopardising public finances that are among the strongest in theEuropean Union. -- As most of Europe struggles with deep deficits andausterity measures, Sweden anticipates a return to a budgetsurplus already in 2012.  -- Borg studied economics at Stockholm University and hasworked as adviser to the country's central bank. In the privatesector, he headed the economics department at Swedish bank SEB and served as chief economist for ABN AMRO in Stockholm. -- Borg has said the government would soon resume itsprivatisation campaign but because it does not have a majorityin parliament following the election, it may not be strongenough to push asset sales past a reluctant parliament. -- The four-party ruling coalition wants to sell 100 billioncrowns ($14 billion) in state assets over the next four years tohelp reduce state debt.             ]]></raw>
