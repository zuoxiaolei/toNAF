<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro retains gains as concerns about euro zone debt ease * Strong response to Spanish auctions supports high-yielders * Dollar index vulnerable on the charts, soft vs Swissie By Satomi Noguchi TOKYO, June 18 (Reuters) - The euro held at three-week highson Friday, on track for its second straight week of gains, whilethe dollar appeared vulnerable to further losses after fallingbelow a key chart level. The euro retained gains near $1.24 as investors liquidatedshort positions after solid demand at Spanish bond auctions,which also encouraged some investors to shift funds back to eurozone bonds from safe-haven U.S. Treasuries, traders said. Peripheral European debt markets calmed after the auction,whetting investors' appetite for riskier assets and supportinghigher-yielding currencies like the Australian and New Zealanddollars which touched one-month highs. "While the news flow out of Europe started the week negative,a good Spanish bond auction overnight and the potential for acoordinated bank stress test across the euro area ... hasbolstered investor confidence that European officials arebeginning to get things right," Barclays Capital said in a noteto clients. The euro rose as far as $1.2414, a three-week peak, and heldat $1.2400 after gaining 0.6 percent on Thursday. It has advanced more than 2 percent so far this week,overcoming a Moody's downgrade of Greece's credit rating to junkstatus and pulling further away from a four-year low of $1.1876struck on June 7. Traders said there were some light stops lined up above theday's high, with near-term resistance at $1.2457, the singlecurrency's 2009 low hit during the global financial crisis. The spread between Spanish government bond yields andbenchmark German Bunds narrowed from a euro lifetime high afterThursday's auction. The euro was also being helped by broad dollar weakness aftera rise in jobless claims and weaker-than-expected manufacturingdata on Thursday prompted investors to scale back expectations ofa rate hike by the Federal Reserve. "I still think the euro is a sell into rallies and I expectit to see resistance at $1.25," said Gregg Gibbs, currencystrategist at RBS, Sydney. European leaders agreed on Thursday to publish details ofstress tests showing the financial health of individual banksnext month and to toughen budget rules to restore confidence intheir currency union. Some market players believed the release of stress testswould boost investor trust in European banks, but others wereconcerned they could reveal fragility in the sector and hurt theeuro. The dollar index was at 85.57, down 0.1 percent afterbrushing a one-month low at 85.491. Technically it lookedvulnerable to a further fall after it broke through support at85.85, with traders and analysts citing the 85.13 area -- its May21 low -- after a bearish reversal in the previous session. "If that level goes, then you'll probably see a bit morecapitulation (from dollar longs) on that front," said Sue Trinh,senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong. The dollar was marginally lower at 90.88 yen, having fallen0.5 percent in the previous session after theweaker-than-expected U.S. data. Trinh said there was some talk of stop-loss sell orders below90.75 yen. The Japanese government in its economic growth strategycalled on the Bank of Japan to "do its utmost" to beat deflationand said fiscal and monetary policies for ending price fallsshould help the country avoid excessive rises in the yen. Analysts said the wording on the forex policy may havesounded less aggressive than expected for some market players whohad expectations for drastic steps to weaken the yen, helping theyen's rise. But the overall reaction was limited, traders said. The Swiss franc was also firm, having rallied afterSwitzerland's central bank backed off its pledge to fightexcessive currency strength now that deflation risks havereceded.

Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was up 0.2 percent at$0.8693, after touching a one-month high at $0.8714, boosted bybetter risk appetite. The NZ dollar likewise was holding justbelow a one-month high of $0.7068. (Additional reporting by Anirban Nag in Sydney and CharlotteCooper in Tokyo; Editing by Joseph Radford)             ]]></raw>
