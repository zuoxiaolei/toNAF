<raw><![CDATA[ * BoE says could cut payments on commercial bank reserves * Governor King sees slow recovery * King says plan needed to restore sound public finances  By Sumeet Desai and David Milliken LONDON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The Bank of England could cutthe interest rate it pays on commercial banks' deposits,Governor Mervyn King said on Tuesday as he warned full recoveryfrom Britain's worst recession in decades would be a long slog. Market reaction was swift and savage. Two-year gilt yieldsfell to a record low and short sterling futures raced up in thebusiest day for the December contract this year, especially asKing also indicated an expansion to the BoE's 175 billionasset-buying programme was also possible. "We certainly would not want to reduce the rate ofremuneration on a certain level of reserves, that is part of theframework, but above some normal level we could have a lowerrate at which they are remunerated," King told parliament'sTreasury Committee. "What it would do is perhaps make the banks work a littlebit harder to try individually to convert some of those reservesinto other assets." Some strategists had been expecting the BoE to cut the rateit pays on reserves when it held borrowing costs at a record lowof 0.5 percent last week. But while King's comments indicate the BoE is clearlymulling the idea of improving the efficacy of its quantitativeeasing programme, no change is likely to be imminent. Analysts will have to wait for more details when the BoEpublishes minutes of its last Sept 9-10 rate-setting meetingnext week.  SLOW RECOVERY King was downbeat on the economic outlook, saying thatdespite signs of a gradual return to growth a large amount ofeconomic slack meant inflation still risked undershooting theBank's 2 percent target over the medium term. "There are now signs that growth has resumed in the thirdquarter," King told the Treasury committee of Britain's lowerhouse of parliament. "Looking further ahead the strength and thesustainability of the recovery is highly uncertain." The jury was still out on whether a further expansion inquantitative easing was needed, King said. "These are the difficult judgements we have to make -- as towhether what we've done already will come through ... providinga stimulus to broad money and spending growth in the future, orwhether in fact we need to do more," he said. He said that as far as most people and companies wereconcerned, the recession would not feel as if it was over forsome time. "While there is this large margin of spare capacity, thatmeans unemployment is high and in the foreseeable future keepsrising. It will take some considerable time before that sparecapacity is used up." Earlier, official data showed British consumer priceinflation slowed less than expected in August as transport costsrose, partly offsetting a downward impact from utility  billsand food prices. [ID:nLF386677]  King brushed off recent criticism from former MonetaryPolicy Committee member David Blanchflower that the BoE had beentoo slow to react to the rapid worsening in the economy lastyear, but confirmed he had rebuked Blanchflower for describingthe August 2008 Inflation Report as "wishful thinking" in aReuters interview. "I think it was reasonable for me to point out that this wasa view that other members of the committee had been upset by ...it wasn't wise behaviour and I was asked to make that clear tohim by other members of the committee."
