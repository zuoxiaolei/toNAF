<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The euro was up for the third consecutive day against the Swiss franc on Monday, rising to a 4-day high, after the Swiss National Bank said it was ready to “take the measures necessary” to counter deflation, fuelling speculation it may intervene to weaken the franc. EUR/CHF hit 1.2698 during European afternoon trade, the pair’s highest since December 21; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2644, jumping 0.32%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.2437, the low of December 22 and an all-time low, and resistance at 1.2780, the high of December 20.On Sunday, Swiss newspaper Sonntag reported that the Swiss government met with the heads of the nation’s top banks to discuss methods of protecting Swiss exports from the renewed strength of the Swiss franc.The report follows the Swiss National Bank’s quarterly bulletin report published on Friday, which said, “Concerns about stability in the euro area have led to renewed financial market tensions. Should these tensions be exacerbated and put a strain on economic developments in the euro area, this would also have a detrimental effect on the Swiss economy.” The report added that, “If a deflation risk emerges, the SNB would take the measures necessary to ensure price stability."SNB President Philipp Hildebrand called the franc’s recent rally a “burden” for Swiss exports, which account for approximately 50% of the country’s gross domestic product.Elsewhere, the euro was up against the U.S. dollar, with EUR/USD gaining 0.19% to hit 1.3139.On Saturday, the People’s Bank of China unexpectedly raised its benchmark interest rate for the second time since mid-October, in an effort to curb inflation, which surged to a 28-month high in November.             ]]></raw>
