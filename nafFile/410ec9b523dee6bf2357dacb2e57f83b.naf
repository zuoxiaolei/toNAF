<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro remained higher against the dollar on Tuesday after a statement on exchange rates by the G7 calmed jitters over the weaker yen, but the euro’s gains were capped by concerns over political uncertainty in the euro zone.EUR/USD hit 1.3466 during European afternoon trade, the pair’s highest since February 7; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3433, gaining 0.23%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.3363, the session low and resistance at 1.3576, the high of February 7.Market sentiment was boosted after a statement on exchange rates by the G7 made no overt reference to the sharp decline in the yen that has taken place this year.The G7 reaffirmed its commitment to market determined exchange rates, saying that countries will not target exchange rates and warned that excessive volatility can have “adverse implications” for economic and financial stability.The statement came ahead of G20 meeting starting Friday, which is likely to feature discussions on competitive currency devaluations.Elsewhere, Swiss National Bank Chairman Thomas Jordan defended actions by the Bank of Japan to defeat inflation and said that global central banks are not engaged in a currency war.But the euro remained under pressure as ongoing uncertainty ahead of upcoming elections in Italy and political tensions in Spain, where the government is embroiled in a corruption scandal, weighed.The single currency was higher against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP rising 0.61% to 0.8612 and EUR/JPY easing up 0.09% to 126.55.European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was to speak in the Spanish Parliament in Madrid later in the session, while the European Economic and Financial Affairs Council was holding talks in Brussels. Market participants were also awaiting U.S. President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech later Tuesday for any indications of an agreement to avert automatic tax hikes and spending cuts due to take effect on March 1.             ]]></raw>
