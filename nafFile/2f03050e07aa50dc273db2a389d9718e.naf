<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro steady vs dollar, Swiss franc but outlook shaky * China reiterates support for euro zone countries * Dlr/yen breaks below key support, stops hit in thin trade (Releads, changes dateline, adds quote, previous SYDNEY)  By Neal Armstrong LONDON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The euro steadied against thedollar and the Swiss franc on Thursday, helped by supportivecomments from China, but analysts said the outlook for thesingle currency was shaky, with fresh losses expected into 2011. Liquidity was at a premium in currency markets ahead ofyear-end, with traders saying flows were having a bigger impacton price than fundamentals. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said China waswilling to help countries in the euro zone return to economichealth and would support the International Monetary Fund bailoutpackage for the bloc. [ID:nBJI002501] A Portuguese newspaper report on Wednesday suggested Chinawas ready to buy significant amounts of Portuguese debt to tryto instil confidence in the country's ailing economy. But the single currency's outlook remained shaky at best andmore losses into 2011 are seen likely as the euro zone debtcrisis looks set to drag on. "We expect further weakness for the euro by the end of thefirst quarter of 2011, and in the near term a break of the200-day moving average will be important," said Elsa Lignos,currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets. The euro was flat against the dollar  at $1.3100,close to the 200-day moving average at $1.3091. In the pastweek, the euro has fallen about 1 percent against the greenback. The euro was flat at 1.2466 Swiss francs , hoveringnear an all-time low of around 1.2448 hit on Wednesday. "As long as there are periphery concerns in the euro zone, alower euro/Swiss is very hard to fight," Lignos said. Investors have been flocking to the safe-haven status of theSwiss franc and shifting out of euros on worries that the eurozone debt crisis will rumble on. "Our next target for EURCHF is 1.2400," BNP Paribasstrategists said in a client note. "The CHF is currently drivenby capital rather than trade flows and thus remains wellsupported against the EUR as deposit inflows continue."  AUSSIE DOLLAR FIRM The Australian dollar was back at parity against thegreenback thanks to optimism about the global economy, which hassupported commodity prices  and global stocks. The diverging moves showed investors favoured safe havenslike the Swiss franc within Europe, but that they were also keenon currencies deemed riskier like the Aussie given the generallymore upbeat outlook, particularly for emerging economies.    Trading, however, was thin with Tokyo shut for a publicholiday and as the year-end holidays loomed.

Traders said anoption barrier at 83.15 had been eroded in Asia, while supportat the top of the Ichimoku cloud gave way in Europe at 83.08.The base of the cloud was seen as the next support, at 82.07. Yen strength knocked the euro  down 0.6 percent to108.78 yen, with a French bank highlighted as the major seller.  The dollar index , which tracks the greenback'sperformance against a basket of major currencies, fell about 0.2percent to 80.562.   Meanwhile, the New Zealand dollar stood at $0.7448, havingrecovered from a brief fall below $0.7400 in immediate reactionto data showing a contraction in the New Zealand economy for thefirst time in six quarters.
