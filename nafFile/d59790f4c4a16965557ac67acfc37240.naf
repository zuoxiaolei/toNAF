<raw><![CDATA[ * India ready to suspend WTO case as EU backs down * Agreement still needs EU parliament approval * UN warns EU-India free trade pact may raise generics cost  (Adds details on wider generic drugs row, UN comment) By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck BRUSSELS, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The European Union and Indiaresolved a dispute over generic drugs on Friday which shouldremove obstacles to Indian drugs manufacturers exportingproducts to the developing world, officials said. Indian Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma toldReuters the EU's trade chief, Karel De Gucht, told Indiannegotiators during an EU-India summit in Brussels that the issuehad been resolved, and De Gucht confirmed the agreement. "This is a great breakthrough which will of course lead to asuspension of WTO (World Trade Organisation) proceedings. So thedispute is over," said Sharma.  India and Brazil brought a case to the WTO in 2009 sayingthe EU was wrongly stopping and inspecting shipments of genericdrugs in transit, with some shipments being turned away ratherthan being allowed to continue to their final destination.  The EU is still in legal proceedings with Brazil. "I reconfirmed we are going to amend present regulation soas to put into practice what has been agreed," De Gucht toldReuters. "Transports in transit will no longer be checked,except for counterfeiting." The EU said it will amend customs codes that have led tonumerous seizures of generic drugs shipments in transit fromIndia to countries in South America via Europe. The agreement will benefit leading drugs makers such as DrReddy's Laboratories Ltd, whose generic drugs -- legal in Indiabut not recognised in Europe -- have been stopped en route tocountries such as Brazil. It is unclear when WTO legal proceedings will be suspendedas Friday's agreement needs approval from the EU's parliament.  TRADE TALKS CONTINUE Agreement over the WTO dispute sweetened an EU-India summitthat failed to provide major breakthroughs in negotiations overa free trade agreement. Indian and EU leaders on Friday said they would seal a freetrade pact early next year. But concerns continue over EUdemands that India -- a rapidly growing economy that is battlinghigh levels of rural poverty -- should open up vulnerable marketsectors and follow EU patent rules. Market openings could hurt subsistence farmers andshopkeepers, critics say, prompting public protests in India andBrussels against the trade agreement. The United Nations warned on Friday that an EU-India tradedeal could raise the price of Indian generic drugs that providecheap treatment for HIV and malaria in poor countries in Africa,South America and Asia. "Millions in the developing world depend on India forgeneric medicines at affordable costs. Restriction of genericdrug production in India will have a devastating public healthimpact around the world," United Nations Special RapporteurAnand Grover said in a statement. The EU wants India to follow strict and costly registrationprocedures for its drugs, and observe EU terms of patentvalidity, which are longer than in India and give pricey brandeddrugs a longer shelf life. India's Sharma told Reuters in an interview he will protectthe ability of India to produce and export pharmaceuticals andgenerics.             ]]></raw>
