<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar falls broadly on year-end position adjustment * Trade quiet, causing exaggerated movements * U.S. payrolls next week's focus for FX markets  (Updates prices; changes byline, dateline;pvs SYDNEY/SINGAPORE) By Jessica Mortimer LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly onThursday on year-end position adjustment in thin, illiquid tradewhich prompted exaggerated price movements. Trade was extremely light, with Tokyo and several Europeancountries on holiday and many banks on skeleton staff ahead ofthe New Year holidays. The euro jumped well over a cent against the dollar in earlyLondon trade, with traders attributing the move to Asian centralbank dollar selling as well as year-end model trades. The move triggered stops in other currencies against thedollar, which fell across the board, with the Australian and NewZealand dollars the main beneficiaries. "We're probably seeing some sort of rebalancing. The dollarhas had a strong month and people are just taking profits," saidGeoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS in London. At 0918 GMT, the dollar index  was down 0.5 percent to77.508, a big turnaround from the previous session when it roseas high as 78.218. The dollar index has risen around 3.5 percent so far thismonth but is down around 4 percent over the year. The euro  was up 0.6 percent at $1.4419, taking itwell above its December low of $1.4219 although this stillleaves it down nearly 4 percent over the month. "All the models are pointing to a good dollar sell today," aLondon-based trader said. Over the year, the euro was up around 3 percent, althoughthat gain pales compared to the Australian and New Zealanddollars -- easily the best performers among the major currencies-- which have risen around 28 and 25 percent respectively. The two currencies gained strongly on Thursday, with theAustralian dollar  up 0.5 percent at $0.8988 and the NewZealand dollar  up 0.7 percent at $0.7266. Both currencies were hit hard by the global credit crunch in2008 but recovered smartly this year, benefiting from heftyrises in commodity prices and as the Chinese economy continuedto perform well. Elsewhere, the dollar fell 0.2 percent against the yen to 92.23 yen. It was up nearly 7 percent over December,on track for its best monthly performance since February. The Japanese currency was otherwise soft, partly as a yieldplay and partly on concerns over Japan's stretched fiscalposition.  The New Zealand dollar continued to attract risk seekers,extending its rally against the yen for a fourth session anddriving the cross to 67.16 yen , its highest sinceend-October.  PONDERING PAYROLLS There was little in the way of news to digest on Thursday. Uncertainty remains over whether the dollar will continueits December rally into the new year, though next week's U.S.payrolls data could decide the issue. "It's going to be a hugely important number," said a traderat an Australian bank in Sydney. "Anything above forecast couldsee the euro finally break down through $1.4200 toward $1.4000. "A weak result would be a real dampener after the run ofupbeat figures we've seen. The market would have to rethink theFed timing again, and that could see the euro back up at$1.4700."
