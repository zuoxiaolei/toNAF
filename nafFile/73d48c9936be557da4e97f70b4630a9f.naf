<raw><![CDATA[ * Corporate worries, oil, property, cooling demand in Gulf * Local sovereign wealth funds helping to fill the gap * Short-term losses likely, longer term prospects better  By Carolyn Cohn LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Western investors have grown wary about investing in the once-booming Gulf, leaving marketsthere at risk of further short-term losses and increasinglyreliant on the region's own sovereign wealth funds. Collapsing property markets and volatile oil priceshave cooled some of the ardour which western investors had showntowards the Gulf in recent years. But oil-inspired sovereign wealth funds in the region havein some cases grown despite the financial crisis, and arelooking to add stimulus to their own markets rather than riskmoney overseas, analysts say. "A lot of old (western) capital has effectively beendestroyed, a lot of new capital is still there," said ShanatPatel, global strategist at broker Liberum Capital.  "A lot more money is going into the Middle East from theirown sovereign wealth funds. A lot of money is staying at home;they are much more happy to look at their own markets." For international investors, the latest incident to rattlethe market has been corporate debt difficulties at two Saudiconglomerates -- Saad Group and Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi & Bros. Saudi banks may have between $4 billion and $7 billion inlending exposure to the conglomerates, HSBC said in a note. Atleast 5 banks in the United Arab Emirates have exposure to Saudifirms, according to banking sources or the banks themselves. "These two instances definitely are sobering and are quiteheavy in terms of the magnitude," said Amr Seif, portfoliomanager for the Middle East and Africa at Investec AssetManagement. "It has affected a wide range of banks, including developedbanks."  FLOWS DOWN Global flows into Gulf equities have been falling in thelast year and are now, at best, at the same levels as at thethe beginning of 2007, and in some countries such as the UAE arefar lower, according to data from funds tracker EPFR Global. The burst property bubble, erratic oil price and corporatewoes have pushed investors away from the region. Daily volume in United Arab Emirates stocks has fallen toaround $80 million a day, from around $300 million a few weeksago, Seif said. Saudi stocks are trading at 10-week lows and haveunderperformed this year's dizzying emerging market rally,rising only 12 percent, compared with nearly 30 percent gains inthe broader index. Dubai stocks are trading at 6-week lows and have made nogains at all this year. "The combination of falling oil and real estate ... has beena major problem for the region," said Allan Conway, global headof emerging equities at Schroder Investment Management."In the very near term, it's difficult to get too excited."  CHANGE OF TACK Investors looking to make returns will need to wait, withregional capital, the main impetus for growth, focusing onlonger term projects. There are $1.4 trillion in planned government investmentprojects in the Gulf between 2009 and 2015, aimed atdiversifying local economies, according to a report fromMcKinsey Global Institute. "We are cautious to underweight on financials and realestate; we are more positive on companies which have utilitiesexposure," said Scott Darling, a regional equity researchanalyst at Nomura in Dubai. "We are going to see spending in that (utilities) area,where there was not sufficient spending in the past." While some sovereign wealth funds have lost value during thefinancial crisis, and oil is down 60 percent from its recordlevels a year ago, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authorityincreased its assets to $390 billion in 2008 from $350 billionin 2007, due to fixed income investment, the McKinsey reportsaid. Investment projects include Saudi Arabia's plans to expandits petrochemical industry. "We like the fact that petrochemicals are big in SaudiArabia, that's cyclically exposed to the global recovery," saidMichael Wang, emerging equities strategist at Morgan Stanley. The local capital will help to switch the focus away fromprevious hotspots for international investors, such as property. "I would probably stay away from real estate market sectorsin the Dubai market, but rather put funds in energy companiesand domestic demand," said Fredrik Nerbrand, head of globalinvestment strategy at HSBC Private Bank. "You need to have a timeframe that's more similar to 10years than one year. You are buying into structural risk; changeis not going to happen soon." (Editing by Ruth Pitchford)             ]]></raw>
