<raw><![CDATA[ * Inflation not a problem in Bahrain - c.bank gov * Qatar c.bank sees 16 percent GDP growth in 2010  (Adds Bahrain, Qatar central bank comments, background) KUWAIT, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Bahrain's central bank isconcerned about volatility in global currency markets as well asrising food costs, its governor said on Sunday. Meanwhile Qatar's economy will expand strongly this year,the head of its central bank said. "I am concerned on the global side, there is a lot ofuncertainty. There is a great deal of volatility in the marketwhich caused certain anxiety within markets," Bahrain CentralBank Governor Rasheed al-Maraj told Reuters. "The fluctuation in currencies from time to time is areflection of the global economy and we have to recognise andtake into consideration these movements, but it will notinfluence our decisions in the short term," he said. The uncertainty surrounding a fresh round of U.S. monetaryeasing weighed on the dollar on Friday, pushing it just shy of a15-year low against the Japanese yen.The island kingdom pegs its dinar currency to the dollar --as do most of its fellow Gulf Arab crude producers -- whichkeeps its monetary policy closely aligned to that of the UnitedStates. Maraj also said an increase in global food prices wasanother source of worry. "I do not think inflation is a problem for us. The increasein food prices globally is a concern as it transpires intohigher prices on the local market," he said on the sidelines ofa financial conference in Kuwait. Inflation in the small non-OPEC oil producer slowed to asix-month low of 2.0 percent on an annual basis in September,but rose 0.7 percent month-on-month, the fastest rate in a yearas food prices soared. Separately, Qatar's central bank expects the economy of theworld's largest liquefied natural gas exporter to performstrongly this year, its governor told the same conference. "According to our expectations ... growth in GDP this yearis going to be 16 percent," Sheikh Abdullah bin Saud al-Thanisaid. Analysts polled by Reuters expected Qatar's gross domesticproduct to jump 15.5 percent this year, after slowing to 8.7percent in 2009, due to a massive expansion of gas facilitiesand government infrastructure spending.
