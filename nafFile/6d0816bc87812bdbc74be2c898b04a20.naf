<raw><![CDATA[* Merkel digs in on private investor involvement * Says politicians must prevail over markets  By Stephen Brown BERLIN, Nov 24 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkelsaid on Wednesday European politicians needed the "courage" tomake private investors share in the risk of future debt crisesin the euro zone and show financial markets who is in charge. "Have politicians got the courage to make those who earnmoney share in the risk as well? Or is dealing in governmentdebt the only business in the world economy that involves norisk?" Merkel said in a speech to the German parliament. "This is about the primacy of politics, this is about thelimits of the markets," said the chancellor, acknowledging thather insistence on this issue was making markets "nervous". The centre-right German leader is blamed by some in Europefor provoking the recent Irish debt sell-off by saying privateeuro-zone bondholders must be made to share the risk of futuresovereign debt crises via a permanent euro crisis mechanism. She sparked fresh selling of the euro on Tuesday by sayingit was in an "exceptionally serious" situation. [ID:nBAT005787] This prompted one European Central Bank policymaker, EwaldNowotny, to voice irritation at Merkel for not "differentiatingbetween the euro as a currency and the problems of individual(eurozone) states". [ID:nVIE003584] Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble have repeatedin recent weeks that private investors must be involved in a newcrisis mechanism for the euro zone to take effect from mid-2013,when the current mechanism lapses. A German government paper seen by Reuters, which Berlinwants to serve as the basis for discussion in Brussels, saidprivate investors should face "haircuts" or other debt paymentrestructuring measures. Private-sector creditors like banks and financial investorsshould be drawn in by attaching collective action clauses (CACs)to all newly-issued euro zone bonds, said the paper. The new mechanism would succeed the European FinancialStability Facility (EFSF), a safety net created after Greece'sdebt crisis rocked the euro zone earlier this year. Merkel saidshe had a "positive" view on Ireland taking up this mechanism. She faced loud criticism for delaying an aid package forGreece while insisting on deeper austerity measures, finallyagreeing to it days before signing up to the much bigger EFSF. Merkel has said repeatedly that the "the best European" isnot necessary the one who helps other member countries first,but who takes action to strengthen the euro longer-term.             ]]></raw>
