<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The pound pulled back from a two-week high against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, after data showing retail sales in the U.K. rose less-than-expected in June, fuelling concerns over the outlook for the recession hit economy.GBP/USD retreated from 1.5694, the pair’s highest since July 3, to hit 1.5648 during European morning trade, dipping 0.03%.Cable was likely to find support at 1.5580, Wednesday’s low and resistance at 1.5720, the high of July 2.The Office for National Statistics said retail sales inched up by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in June, below expectations for a 0.6% gain, as wet weather hurt demand for outdoor products.Year-on-year, retail sales rose at an annualized rate of 1.6% in June, below expectations for a 2.4% increase, after rising at a rate of 2.1% in the preceding month.  But the dollar remained under pressure after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. central bank was prepared to take further action to support the economy if the jobs market failed to show improvement in a second day of testimony on Wednesday, but failed to explicitly indicate if additional stimulus measures are imminent.Investors remained cautious as Spain prepared to auction as much as EUR3 billion of three and seven year government bonds later in the day, in what was being seen as a key test of investor appetite for Madrid’s debt.Ahead of the auction, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds was at 6.97%, hovering close to the critical 7% threshold, widely viewed as unsustainable in the long run.Sterling was trading within striking distance of a three-and-a-half year high against the euro, with EUR/GBP inching up 0.07% to 0.7851.Later Thursday, the U.S. was to publish government data on initial jobless claims, as well as reports on existing home sales and manufacturing activity in Philadelphia.             ]]></raw>
