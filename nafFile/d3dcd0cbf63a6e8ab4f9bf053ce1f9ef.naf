<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro rises on narrowing spread of Greek vs German debt * Aussie down as RBA surprises and holds rates at 3.75 pct * Market awaits White House adviser Volcker's testimony (Recasts, updates prices) NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The euro rose against thedollar on Tuesday, supported by a narrowing in Greek governmentbond yield spreads over German debt, ahead of the EuropeanCommission's reaction to Greece's internal plan to strengthenits finances. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said the level ofGreek and euro zone bond spreads was "completely unjustified,"keeping up the rhetoric against speculators he blames fortargeting his country. The comments came ahead of the publication on Wednesday ofEU recommendations to Athens on its austerity plan. TheCommission's much-anticipated assessment is likely to be inline with what Greece itself has promised to do in itslong-term deficit-cutting plan. The Australian dollar fell after the Reserve Bank ofAustralia surprised investors by leaving its benchmark interestrate unchanged at 3.75 percent. There had been almost universalconsensus the central bank would raise it to 4 percent. "Bond market fears over Greece reached a high last Thursdayand have since fallen back," said Camilla Sutton, seniorcurrency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. "This hintsthat the market is stabilizing and that much of the bad news isnow priced in." Midway through the New York session, the euro recoveredfrom early losses to trade 0.1 percent higher on the day at$1.3946, recovering from a seven-month low hit on Monday andalmost exactly where it was as the New York session opened. Greek 10-year yield spreads over Bunds were at 353 basispoints, off a session low of 327. Last week, the spreadexpanded beyond 400 basis points, its widest since Greeceadopted the euro in 2001. The slide in confidence in Greece triggered selling in itsgovernment bonds, blowing out its yield spread with Germanbond. But euro gains were capped by concern that deficits inother euro zone countries, such as Portugal, would keepinvestors wary of taking big positions in the euro zone commoncurrency. "Sentiment remains fragile despite the strong U.S. GDP datalast week, and the Greek situation is still in the background,making investors cautious," said Paul Robson, currencystrategist at RBS. Underlining the possibility that fiscal woes may extendbeyond Greece, European Central Bank Governing Council memberVitor Constancio said on Tuesday Portugal's economy required"significant adjustments." The dollar index, a calculated measure of the dollar'sperformance against six currencies, slipped 0.2 percent to79.070, but was still near a six-month high hit on Monday. Thedollar was 0.3 percent lower against the yen at 90.30 yen. AUSSIE DOWN The Australian dollar fell to a low of US$0.8780 beforeparing losses to trade at US$0.8826, down 1 percent in theglobal session after the RBA decision. The Australian dollar held above US$0.8735, which analystssaid was a key level to watch, given that a fall below thatwould take the currency to its lowest in four months. Some analysts said a general improvement in risk sentiment,albeit slight, would limit Aussie losses in the near term, andthey expected the currency to remain in demand, particularlygiven the RBA left possibility open for future rate hikes. "Investors may look to use the dip ... as a buyingopportunity given that broader 'risk' sentiment appears to beimproving and positioning is not stretched," Citi analysts saidin a note. "This suggests there may only be limited scope forstop-loss-driven selling and position unwinding to drive AUDlower. On balance, we believe it is unwarranted to shift awayfrom a positive view on AUD." Risk sentiment will be under scrutiny later when WhiteHouse adviser Paul Volcker appears before the Senate BankingCommittee to defend the administration's proposal to limitrisk-trading by banks, which spooked investors and triggered asell-off in equities when it was unveiled last month. According to testimony obtained by Reuters, Volcker willurge Congress to curb the risks taken by large banks to helpprevent them from being treated as "too big to fail".             ]]></raw>
