Meanwhile, markets focused on the Federal Reserve's policy setting meeting, which was to be followed with a press conference by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke later in the day.Mr. Bernanke was widely expected to reaffirm the bank’s pledge to hold interest rates near zero for an extended period, while investors will watch for clues regarding the current round of quantitative easing, which was due to end on June 30.The Aussie was also slightly higher against the yen, with AUD/JPY edging 0.02% higher to hit 85.09.Earlier Wednesday, data showed that the Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index rose 0.2% in April, after climbing by 0.6% in March, whose figure was revised up from a gain of 0.5%.              ]]></raw>
