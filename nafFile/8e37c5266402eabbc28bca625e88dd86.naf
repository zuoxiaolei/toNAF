<raw><![CDATA[ * Palladium top pick of precious complex * Says taking profits on palladium position * Neutral on gold, sees U.S. dollar as key driver  By Amanda Cooper LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Commodity fund Tiberius AssetManagement prefers palladium over the rest of the preciousmetals in light of its strong fundamental backdrop and sayssister metal platinum is also poised for more gains. Thomas Benedix, who helps manage the $1.7 billion stable ofcommodity funds at Swiss-based Tiberius, says that even thoughthe company has recently pared back its holdings of palladium,the metal is best placed to benefit from a recovering globaleconomy. Palladium, which is primarily used in catalytic convertersand depends largely on demand from gasoline-powered vehicles,has risen by more than 40 percent so far this year to around$580 an ounce to rank as one of 2010's top-performingcommodities. "Palladium probably still has the best fundamentals amongthe precious metals in terms of supply and demand. We see amarket deficit in palladium for 2011 and still good growth ratesin emerging markets, which palladium is exposed to throughgasoline catalysts," Benedix said."We've been overweight in palladium and have recentlyreduced it as it has had a very good run," Benedix said, adding:"It's profit-taking, rather than a fundamental change in view." Palladium's outperformance relative to platinum recentlyrose to its best in six years, thanks to its reliance on thegrowing share of emerging markets such as China of the globalauto sector. Platinum's use in catalysts for diesel engines,which are largely used in the flagging European car market,means it has suffered accordingly. An ounce of platinum costs less than three ounces ofpalladium and at less than two ounces, palladium starts to lookunattractive to the carmakers, and this ratio is coming underincreasing scrutiny, Benedix said.  NO MORE LAGGING Platinum, which is up 15 percent so far this year andtrading just below $1,700 an ounce, has lagged gold, silver andpalladium in the last three months. But Benedix said the metal's restricted supply makes acompelling case for this underperformance to reverse. Output in top supplier South Africa is constantly at themercy of power outages from the country's ageing electricitygrid and from frequent strike action by workers employed in someof the world's deepest mines. Meanwhile, the 7 percent appreciation in the rand againstthe U.S. dollar this year is putting additional pressure onlocal producers who find their product less profitable on theinternational markets, where it is quoted in dollars. "We feel platinum has some potential to at least notunderperform palladium going forward," Benedix said. Tiberius has a fairly optimistic outlook for the globaleconomy, even if it does anticipate more dollar weakness andmore investor unease in the months to come. With that in mind, it remains neutral in gold, which istrading near record highs above $1,380 an ounce, and underweightin silver. "There is a lot of fear in the markets, as well, of bothinflation and deflation. If these fears subside a little bit,then we think gold could lose a little of its safe-havenappeal," Benedix said. "Then, in the longer term, we're not outright economicbulls. We do see some deflationary pressure out of the U.S.Again, we think more will depend on the emerging markets goingforward, how the China story plays out in 2011, we don't know."
