<raw><![CDATA[ LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange said onMonday it has not lodged a complaint with Britain's FinancialServices Authority (FSA) over plans to launch physical basemetal exchange traded products (ETP). "Normally we wouldn't discuss dealings with the FSA, but wewill confirm that we haven't made an official complaint," theLME said, adding it had not made any other type of complaint. "The LME is not going to try to block any ETPs via the FSA." Providers that in recent weeks have announced plans tolaunch the ETPs include U.K.-based ETF Securities and U.S. bankJP Morgan.
