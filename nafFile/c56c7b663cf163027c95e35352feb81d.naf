<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds details, background) * Curbs on capital inflows lifted effective next week * Bank sector restructuring to be complete end-November * Nordic aid disbursement imminent  By Sebastian Tong LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Curbs on capital inflows intoIceland will be lifted next week as it prepares to receivedisbursements from international lenders including theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and Nordic countries, thecountry's economic affairs minister said on Friday. Gylfi Magnusson also said the restructuring of the bankingsystem was near an end, a year after its collapse knocked theisland nation's economy into recession.  "The first stage (of the lifting of capital controls) willbe announced today or tomorrow and that will be the freeing ofall inflow of capital...the next stage will be the graduallifting of restrictions on the outflow," Magnusson toldreporters in London. Magnusson said the government had no specific dates for theeasing of restrictions on outflows as this would depend onexternal economic conditions, the extent of new capital inflowsas well as currency reserve levels of the central bank.  Capital controls were introduced by Reykjavik a year ago tostem the outflow of capital with the collapse of Iceland's crowncurrency, which has since shed about half its value.Vital to the easing of capital controls has been securingfinancing from its international lenders but an internationaldispute over what to do with foreign savers who lost money whenthree of Iceland's largest banks collapsed in October 2008 hadheld up the IMF's $2.2 billion loan programme. But on Wednesday the IMF approved a first review of thecountry's economic performance under the programme, paving theway for the disbursement of a $167.5 million loan tranche. "IMF resources were needed to do this in an orderly manner,"he said, adding that he expected the first installment of a $2.5billion loan package from Denmark, Norway and Sweden soon. An additional three disbursements would follow fromDecember, he said, in tandem with subsequent IMF progressreports.  FULLY FUNCTIONAL Magnusson said the restructuring of the country's banks wasnear completion and a banking system "fully functional in everyrespect and ready to do its part" in Iceland's economic recoverywould be in place by the end of November.  Iceland's three largest banks -- Glitnir, Landsbanki andKaupthing -- folded within a week last October, owing more than$60 billion to foreign creditors. Magnusson said the majority of the banking system would heldprivately but the government would retain a stake in therestructured lenders. "There will be conditions to allow the banks to grow butthey will be more tightly controlled than previously," he said,adding that bank capital requirements would be higher thaninternational requirements. Magnusson said regulators will work to prevent a repeat ofthe build-up of foreign currency lending by banks to Icelandichousehold. Many of the 320,000 people in Iceland have mortgages, carloans and other debts in foreign currencies such as the Swissfranc and Japanese yen. The government has forecast an 8.4 percent contraction inthe gross domestic product this year but Magnusson said Icelandcould see its economy expand again in the second or thirdquarters next year before returning to annual growth from 2011onwards. "There is enormous uncertainty but...(GDP) in 2010 as awhole could come out to around zero," he said.  The Icelandic crown was up 0.89 percent against the dollarand 0.11 firmer against the euro at 1550 GMT.  (Additional reporting by Sujata Rao; Editing by Andy Bruce)             ]]></raw>
