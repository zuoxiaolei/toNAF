Both the euro and dollar  at one point hit record lowsagainst the Swiss currency as investor demand for thetraditional safe haven remained elevated. As the deadline for raising the U.S. statutory borrowinglimit nears, investors "are going to want to hold othercurrencies and that will weigh on the dollar," said MarkMcCormick, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman inNew York.
