<raw><![CDATA[ By Krittivas Mukherjee NEW DELHI, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Indian and European Unionleaders meeting this week must provide fresh impetus to stalledtalks on a new trade pact, a European Commission diplomat saidon Wednesday. The two sides launched negotiations in 2007 for afree trade agreement (FTA), but progress has been hamperedbecause of differences over intellectual property rights and EUefforts to link trade with climate and India's social sectorperformance. "The FTA negotiations are very complex. We have to jumpinto the cold water of give and take," said Daniele Smadja, thehead of the European Commission's delegation to India. "We have to get into the exchange of concessions. We stillhave very difficult negotiations before us, so we needinspiration from the leadership." While negotiations for theDoha round of world trade talks drag, India has been inkingfree trade agreements with the likes of Thailand, South Koreaand the ASEAN bloc of Southeast Asian nations. The EU is among India's biggest trading partners. Indianexports jumped 29 percent from the previous year to $34.5billion in 2007-8, according to government data, and theproposed pact is expected to help bilateral trade exceed $237billion by 2015. An FTA between the EU and India could improve market accessfor goods and services, covering all trade except for publicprocurement, which India is reluctant to include in the pact.India is also concerned, among other things, about costlycertificates for exporting fruit to the EU and conformityprocedures for the EC mark. "We will have to find a way to cometo grips with the substance of the negotiations," Smadja said. She said the one-day India-EU summit on Friday would alsodiscuss the global financial crisis, terrorism and globalwarming, a key area of negotiations ahead of the Decemberconference in Copenhagen for a global pact to fight climatechange. India, which insists developed countries take deeper carbonemission cuts and fund developing nation's climate actions, hasopposed efforts, including by the EU, to remove the distinctionbetween rich and poorer countries. "They will discuss and compare notes on what are theprospects for Copenhagen -- how we can work together ... tomake Copenhagen a success," Smadja said. The summit is likely to see the two sides sign an agreementfor cooperation on an international thermal-nuclear project. (Editing by Surojit Gupta and Alex Richardson)             ]]></raw>
