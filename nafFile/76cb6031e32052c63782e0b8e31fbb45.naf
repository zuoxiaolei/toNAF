<raw><![CDATA[ BEIJING, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The United States has decidedto impose special safeguard duties on Chinese-made tyres,opening the door to complaints from a host of other industriesthat claim harm from rising Chinese imports. China on Monday requested World TradeOrganisation-sanctioned consultations with the U.S. over theduties. It is increasingly turning to the WTO to solve suchdisputes, and keep markets open to its products. Here are some of the key disputes dogging China-U.S. trade: TYRES The Obama administration imposed safeguard duties onChinese-made tyres, after a complaint by unions that low-pricedChinese imports are forcing American factories to close.. Chinahas requested consultations on the duties, a preliminary steptowards a WTO complaint. The new duty of 35 percent will take effect on Sept. 26 andadds to an existing 4 percent duty. The extra duty would fallto 30 percent in the second year and 25 percent in the thirdyear. POULTRY China said it would conduct anti-dumping and anti-subsidyinvestigations into imports of U.S. chicken parts andautomotive parts, in an apparent response to the U.S. tyreduties. U.S. breeders like Tyson Foods Inc sell chicken feet andwings, which Americans don't eat, to China where they aredelicacies, helping pad their profit margin on each chicken.The parts sell for about 40 U.S. cents a pound in China,compared with about 2 U.S. cents/pound in the United States. China launched a WTO case in April over U.S. legislationthat forbids the U.S. government from beginning the process ofcertifying Chinese cooked poultry exporters. The House of Representatives appropriations bill extendsthe measure for a fourth year, while the Senate version ordersthe government to begin the certifying process. STEEL PIPES The United States on Sept. 9 imposed duties ranging from10.90 percent to 30.69 percent on Chinese-made steel pipes usedto transport oil. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce denouncedthe move as protectionist and the Chinese firms involved saidthey might appeal. Separately, China has filed a WTO challenge to U.S.anti-dumping duties on certain types of steel pipes, pneumaticoff-road tyres and woven sacks. BLANKETS, BRICK A U.S. trade panel in August approved an investigation intowhether imports of electric blankets made in China materiallyinjured or threatened to injure U.S. manufacturers. On Sept. 11, the U.S. International Trade Commissiondecided, in a 3-3 vote, to recommend the U.S. Department ofCommerce conduct a countervailing duty and anti-dumping dutyinvestigation into Chinese-made magnesia carbon brick, asteelmaking material. Preliminary duty recommendations are duein October and January. RAW MATERIALS The European Union and the United States are arguing to theWTO that Chinese export restrictions, including taxes andquotas, on several raw materials unfairly elevate theinternational price, while keeping input prices cheaper formanufacturers in China.. DISTRIBUTION SERVICES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS In August, a WTO panel found in favour of the UnitedStates, which claimed that Chinese curbs on importing anddistributing foreign publications and audiovisual productsviolated its WTO commitments. China may appeal. Both the U.S. and China claimed victory earlier this year,when a WTO panel found that China had failed to protect andenforce intellectual property rights, but rejected the U.S.contention that China sets the threshold for prosecuting piracyso high that it is ineffective. China noted the findings didnot challenge its right to censor content. GRANTS, LOANS AND OTHER INCENTIVES The United States, Mexico and Guatemala requested WTOconsultations regarding certain grants, loans and otherincentives to encourage exports of Chinese brands. FINANCIAL INFORMATION China in November settled on a complaint by the EU, theUnited States and Canada against China's requirement thatforeign financial information suppliers, including ThomsonReuters, must operate through an entity designated by theXinhua news agency, rather than dealing directly withsubscribers.
