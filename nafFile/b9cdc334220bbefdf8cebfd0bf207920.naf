<raw><![CDATA[ * Jobs data misses forecast, but unemployment down * Fed's Bernanke to testify before Congress * Futures: Dow off 9 pts, S&P off 2.3 pts, Nasdaq off 1 pt  (Updates prices, adds payrolls data, changes quote) By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Jan 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to openlower on Friday after a mixed U.S. payrolls report failed toconfirm heightened expectations of a healing labor market. The U.S. economy created 103,000 jobs in December, farbelow the 175,000 economists had forecast, but the unemploymentrate dropped to 9.4 percent, the lowest since May 2009.  Overbought levels on the S&P 500 opened the door to thepossibility of declines after payrolls disappointed. Short-termtechnical support for the benchmark was found near 1,260, its14-day moving average. The S&P closed at 1,273.85 on Thursday. Economists had revised their forecasts higher afterWednesday's surprising strong ADP private-sector employmentfigures, which were triple forecasts. "The big benefit here is that the unemployment rate droppedto 9.4 percent. I would categorize this as continued positivemomentum and evidence that the economy is improving andgrowing," said Oliver Pursche, president at Gary GoldbergFinancial Services in Suffern, New York. S&P 500 futures fell 2.3 points, and were slightly belowfair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking intoaccount interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on thecontract. Dow Jones industrial average futures were down 9points, and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 1 point.             ]]></raw>
