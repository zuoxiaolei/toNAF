<raw><![CDATA[ * Greece faces 20 bln euros of redemptions in April, May  * Delaying next bond in the hope that spreads will fall * Default very unlikely, govt could turn to bilateral aid  By George Georgiopoulos ATHENS, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Even if EU leaders put some fleshon the bones of their vague promises to support Athens nextweek, Greece still faces a race against time to win back marketconfidence to fend off a financing squeeze looming before June. Pledges of political support for debt-strapped Greece at aBrussels summit on Thursday included no details of a possiblerescue plan and failed to calm bond investors' nerves ahead of aheavy issuance period for Athens. Greece, which has around 7 billion euros in Treasurycoffers, faces two large bond redemptions of about 20 billioneuros ($27.5 billion) in April and May. The EU package, whichmay be fleshed out when EU ministers meet next week, will notalone be enough to win investors' goodwill. "The big challenge for Greece is to satisfy markets and theother euro zone members that no slippage is taking place in itsfiscal plans," said Justin Knight, strategist at UBS. Markets appeared willing to lend money to Athens as recentlyas Jan. 25, when a 5-year bond, the government's first sale thisyear, raised a heavily oversubscribed 8 billion. But Greece wasforced sell the debt at a steep yield of 6.1 percent. This not only adds to budget strains but risks choking arecovery as banks pass on higher interest rates in loans tohouseholds and businesses. Greece has borrowed just 13 billion euros of the 53.2billion euros its needs for 2010 and its next sortie will be a10-year bond issue planned for this month or March. The debtagency delayed the bond in hopes an EU deal would lower yields. The plan seemed to be working. The yield spread of 10-yearGreek bonds over bunds tightened sharply a euro lifetime highabove 400 basis points last month on hopes for an EU bailout.  But Greek spreads widened again on Friday and the eurocurrency weakened as investors fretted that political oppositionin EU powerhouse Germany would dilute any resue deal andworse-than-expected Greek GDP data spooked the market.  NO BOND BEFORE MARCH One treasurer at a major Greek bank, who asked not to benamed, said he did not expect the government to return to themarket before wage and tax measures announced this week werepassed into law this month, despite strong union opposition. Prime Minister George Papandreou has received EU support onthe back of his ambitious plan to slash Greece's deficit from12.7 percent of GDP last year to below the EU ceiling of 3percent by 2012. "What's needed is time for markets and the EU to see theoutcome," the bank treasurer said. "Before March, it will be tooearly to tell." But Greece's unions are spoiling for a fight. After a24-hour strike on Wednesday, public sector union ADEDY haspledged to escalate action to force a government back-down. Andwith Greece's debt due to top 120 percent of GDP this year, itsfiscal problems will not disappear without tough action. "It is a race against time to gain market confidence," saidMillennium Bank Treasurer Panagiotis Dimitropoulos, adding hewas confident spring debt issues would be covered. Greece is fortunate that its debt profile has a relativelylong maturity compared to other euro zone countries, a bighelping hand in the current debt crisis. At 7.8 years, its debtduration is the second longest in the euro zone. With a debt mountain approaching one-third of a trillioneuros, having to roll over a bigger chunk than the 30.2 billionin redemptions this year would have spelled much deeper trouble. "Our long maturity profile and low rollover ratio areadvantages, giving us significant breathing space," said a Greekdebt agency official who did not want to be named. "After wecover the maturities in April and May, it'll be an easier ride." Greece has said it will adopt a flexible strategy this year,feeling out the market and weighing options including moreT-bills, private placements of floaters and syndicated deals. "Greece must go out and borrow whenever it sees a window ofopportunity. It will have to accept the cost," Dimitropoulossaid. "With very short-term issuance you may get lower costs butyou increase liquidity risk."   For a FACTBOX on Greece's debt profile click             ]]></raw>
