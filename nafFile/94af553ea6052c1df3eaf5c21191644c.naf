<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The yen fell against the dollar on Friday on market expectations that G20 policymakers will back off on warning countries that only markets should set their exchange rates.In U.S. trading on Friday, USD/JPY was trading at 93.44, up 0.61%, up from a session low of 92.23 and off a high of 93.84.The pair was likely to find support at 92.23, the earlier low, and resistance at 93.84, the earlier high.Earlier this week, the G7 group of wealthy nations issued a statement expressing concern over weakening currencies and urged policymakers to allow markets to determine the value of a currency and not actively devalue, which markets interpreted as a message to Japan.The Japanese yen has weakened notably in recent weeks thanks to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's repeated calls for looser monetary policies to prioritize growth over keeping inflation in a tight range, though no G7 officials have said the country was actively devaluing its currency.The yen shot up in recent sessions after the G7 issued its statement urging the world's policymakers to not devalue currencies.Yet the G20 summit is underway, and talk grew on Friday that the statement will echo the G7 statement and urge countries to let markets determine exchange rates but won't make mention of country-specific devaluation concerns, which boosted the dollar on Friday and let the yen resume its slide.The dollar also saw demand after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told G20 finance ministers and central bankers earlier that while unemployment rates remain high in the U.S., the economy is improving.The news sent the greenback rising on sentiment the Fed may be closer to considering winding down its USD85 billion monthly bond-buying program, a monetary stimulus tool that weakens the dollar to spur recovery and job demand.Soft activity in U.S. mines, utilities and factories fueled dollar demand as well.Official data showed that U.S. industrial production slipped 0.1% in January, missing expectations for a 0.2% rise after a 0.4% increase the previous month.Elsewhere in the U.S., economic indicators came in solid.In a preliminary report, the University of Michigan said that its index of consumer sentiment rose to 76.3 in February from 73.8 the previous month, well above expectations for a rise to 74.8. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that its index of manufacturing activity improved beat expectations in February, rising to 10.0 from a reading of -7.8 the previous month. Analysts had expected the index to improve to -2 this month.The yen, meanwhile was down against the pound and up against the euro, with GBP/JPY up 0.72% and trading at 144.92 and EUR/JPY trading up 0.52% at 124.73.Â                         ]]></raw>
