<raw><![CDATA[ * Reassurances on Greece fall on skeptical market ears * G7 points to narrowing of differences on bank reform * Arctic venue proves popular, complicated * No change on FX thinking By Janet Guttsman and Glenn Somerville IQALUIT, Canada Feb 6 (Reuters) - Reassurances aboutdebt-strapped Greece and agreement that banks should pay forfuture rescue funds capped an international meeting in Canada'sArctic, as European policymakers sought to convince jitterymarkets that they have things under control. Ministers and central bank governors said economies wererecovering from recession but stuck to their view that it wastoo early to withdraw government help. In a statement issued on Saturday after two days of talksby the Group of Seven rich industrialized countries, EuropeanCentral Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said he believedGreece would meet tough new targets to rein in its budget gap. "We expect and we are confident that the Greek governmentwill take all the decisions that will permit it to reach thatgoal," Trichet said. French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said euro zonecountries would make sure the Greek plan was implemented andJean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the group of euro zone financeministers, dismissed the idea Greece would need money from theInternational Monetary Fund. Not everyone was convinced it would be that easy, however,given that Greece's problems already have driven down debtprices of other high-deficit European countries. World stock markets slumped to three-month lows on Fridayon fear that the crisis would spread and the euro fell to itslowest level against the dollar in 8-1/2 months. "I don't think Trichet's comments will help ease concernsabout the euro zone. There is still no concrete plan on theGreek issue," said Boris Schlossberg, Director of FX Researchat GFT in New York. "The other problem is that the G7 has agreed to put a taxon banks, and any type of taxation on the banking sector isgoing to be viewed negatively by the market. So the net resultof all this is not a boost of confidence in the capital market.We may see a little more turbulence going forward. Overall, theG7 meeting, instead of reassuring the market may have simplycreated more angst." MAKING THE BANKS PAY Greece, which aims to slash its budget deficit of nearly 13percent of gross domestic product to below 3 percent in 2012,was a late entry to the G7 agenda. Earlier, ministers had expected talks to focus on effortsto reform a financial sector that is still recovering from themarket meltdown caused by the credit crisis. Officials from the G7, a rich countries' club comprisingBritain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the UnitedStates, said support was rising for a levy on banks that couldpay for global governments' rescue of the financial system. But such a levy would have to be designed so it did notderail a tentative economic recovery, they said. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner played downdifferences between countries on banking reform. Last month the Obama administration stunned the bankingindustry with tough reform proposals that took other countriesby surprise too, "We all share a deep commitment to try to move forward andreach agreement on a strong, comprehensive set of financialreforms on the timetable we all committed to last September,"Geithner said."That means agreement on...a new set of capital requirementsfor large global institutions by the end of this year." Iqaluit, the town that hosted the meeting, was the mostexotic and inaccessible location for a G7 meeting to date,offering unique extracurricular activities like dog-sleddingand food that included Arctic char and muskox minestrone. A shortage of commercial flights and the distances involvedmeant most ministers used government jets. Every hotel room wasfull in Iqaluit, located by the iced-over Frobisher Bay. Geithner said the G7 underscored its commitment toreinforcing recovery, while Canada's Jim Flaherty said theglobal economy was improving but still needed government help. "We do not have a firmly established recovery yet, butthere are signs," he said. "We need to continue to deliver thestimulus to which we are committed and begin to look ahead toexit strategies and to move to a more sustainable fiscaltrack." DEBTOR PARADISES The United States and other big economies are also saddledwith debts, having spent heavily to stave off a depression. Ratings agency Moody's Investors Service this week said theUnited States must do more to keep its AAA rating after theObama administration said it expected a deficit equivalent to10.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2010, more than threetimes the level considered sustainable by economists. But Japan, which also faces a yawning budget gap, admittedit had got off lightly. "I explained Japan's fiscal situation to the G7 and franklyexpected more discussion about it. But much time was spentexchanging views on Greece," said a clearly relieved JapaneseFinance Minister Naoto Kan, speaking to reporters after adog-sledding adventure which he described as moving. Ministers said the G7, which issued no formal communique onSaturday, stuck by the statement it made last October onforeign exchange, when it said it was monitoring markets andwould cooperate as appropriate. Lagarde said under the new, more informal format of the G7meetings, the group had decided to issue separate statements oncurrencies only when it had something new to say. But others said discussions of foreign exchange policy neednot be limited to the G7. While some European members likeFrance said the G7 was the best forum, Japan's Kan suggestedthat if discussions were to involve China's yuan, for example,then talks could take place in the wider Group of 20 developedand emerging economies, which includes key players like China. The Iqaluit meeting could be the last standalone gatheringof a group that dominated international finance for decades butbecame less relevant as emerging markets gained power.
