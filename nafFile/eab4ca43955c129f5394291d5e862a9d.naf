<raw><![CDATA[ * Reveals corporate commitments at 2.4 billion euros * Says insurance unit has just under 400 mln sovereign risk * Confirms bank sovereign exposure at 850 million euros (Adds details, results expectations) By Lionel Laurent PARIS, May 7 (Reuters) - French bank Credit Agricole revealed a total exposure to Greece of 3.8 billion euros ($5.1billion) on Friday, as debt worries continued to pressure thefinancial sector. Credit Agricole, which reports first-quarter results nextweek, was seen as particularly vulnerable to Greece's economicproblems because of its unprofitable Greek subsidiary Emporikiin which it bought a two thirds stake in 2006. The Greek unit, now over 90 percent-owned, has been sappingresults for years while the bank's former chief executive,Georges Pauget, said it would not sell out. Credit Agricole was expected to report a first-quarter netprofit of 514 million euros, more than double what it earned inthe 2009 period, according to a Reuters poll. The updated 3.8 billion euro exposure figure included banksovereign risk of 850 million, insurance sovereign risk of justunder 400 million, investment-banking corporate exposure of 2.4billion and interbank risk exposure of 180 million. The figure does not include private-sector exposure atEmporiki, the bank said. Credit Agricole shares were down 1.4 percent in morningtrade, in line with declines at larger rivals BNP Paribas andSociete Generale. BNP has disclosed sovereign exposure to Greece of 5 billioneuros and corporate commitments of around 3 billion. SocieteGenerale's sovereign exposure is 3 billion euros. Credit Agricole has restructured itself in the aftermath ofthe financial crisis and has been led by chief executiveJean-Paul Chifflet since March. The group said in February ithad seen a good start to the year. French banks have the biggest international exposure toGreek debt as at the end of 2009 but unlike German banks theyhave not been asked to participate directly in the rescuepackage for the debt-stricken country.
