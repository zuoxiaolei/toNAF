<raw><![CDATA[ HANOI, April 5 (Reuters) - A total 50,000 tonnes of Indiancorn and soymeal rejected by Vietnam for containing insects havebeen sold to Indonesia, while Indian exporters have not resumed cargo sales to Vietnam, traders said on Tuesday.	 The two ships held in late January at the northern port ofHaiphong and Cai Mep port in Ho Chi Minh City left for Indonesiain late March, after the plant protection department rejectedproposals to refumigate the cargoes.	 The quality of the corn and soymeal remained good after thedetention, traders familiar with the sales said. They did notgive further details.	 The cargo's departure has ended efforts over the course ofabout two months by sellers, buyers, Indian agriculturalofficials and diplomats to seek a solution after a type ofbeetle typical in India was detected, prompting the rejection. 	The efforts included a visit by some Indian officials to Hanoiand Haiphong ports.	  Indian traders said exporters were still not selling cargoesto Vietnam as they feared further rejections.	 Since India has not heard of any other importer complainingabout quality, Indian traders said Vietnam's refusal to acceptcargoes might have some political overtones.	 Traders in Vietnam have said given the Southeast Asiancountry's traditional role as a key buyer of India's corn andsoymeal, they did not expect India to interfere strongly to getthe cargoes in, as this might hurt the overall relationship.	 Corn prices in Vietnam had risen 11 percent after thecargoes had been rejected, an industry official said.[ID:nHAN213200]	 Feed prices in Vietnam have now nearly doubled from a yearago due to exchange rate changes, high bank interest rates andrising production costs, as Vietnam imports 60 percent of thematerial used for processing, state media said on Tuesday.	 Feed prices were set to further increase in coming daysafter Vietnam raised retail fuel prices last month following ahike in electricity and a major devaluation of the dong by 8.5percent in February.
