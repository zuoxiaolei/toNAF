<raw><![CDATA[ By Natsuko Waki LONDON, June 22 (Reuters) - Azerbaijan's sovereign wealthfund has no plans to reduce euro holdings in its $17 billionportfolio as it is confident the euro zone will solve its debtcrisis, the country's chief investment officer said on Tuesday. Concerns about huge debt in euro zone peripheral countriesand the gloomy economic outlook pushed the euro to a four-yearlow around $1.1875 earlier this month -- a 17 percent fall sinceJanuary. The sharp decline in the single currency has fannedspeculation that foreign exchange reserve managers and sovereignwealth funds might reconsider their long-term asset allocationstrategy given huge paper losses on their euro holdings. The State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ), which receivesrevenues from oil and gas and transit fees, allocates 50 percentof its assets in U.S. dollars, 40 percent in the euro, 5 percentin sterling and the rest in other currencies. "There has been huge volatility in the market. But we don'tbet on currency moves. We're not so pessimistic about the futureof the euro," Israfil Mammadov told Reuters in London. "There could be problems in terms of the coordination amongeuro zone countries but ultimately we think countries of theeuro zone will succeed in overcoming the crisis." SOFAZ's currency allocation, which is rebalanced quarterly,automatically involves selling dollars on a regular basis giventhat its revenues are from dollar-priced energy resources. The former Soviet republic's fund has all of its assets infixed income, including sovereign, corporate and agency papers.It is a portfolio investor and only invests abroad. It plans to invest in overseas equities to diversify assetsin the future, although Mammadov gave no further details.  FRONTIER FOCUS SOFAZ, along with other state funds in Saudi Arabia andSouth Korea, invested in April in an $800 million fund managedby a subsidiary of the World Bank's private-sector lender IFCthat will invest in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. It is one of SOFAZ's first major investments outside thefixed income market and in frontier markets -- potentiallyhighly profitable but risky investment destinations. "In those (frontier market) countries you have to partnerwith those institutions which have strong expertise andknowledge of the markets, being on the ground and talking tocompanies," Mammadov said. Frontier markets also carry other risks from underdevelopedregulation, illiquid financial markets and poor corporategovernance records. "Many other investments carry risks as well. As a sovereignwealth fund, our reputation is of the utmost importance.Governance issues are paramount to us," Mammadov said. "We're owned by people of the country. We're reporting topeople. We're in a public domain in the country. We cannotafford not to be prudent." Mammadov has said the fund's assets under management are setto exceed $150 billion by 2030.(Editing by Stephen Nisbet)             ]]></raw>
