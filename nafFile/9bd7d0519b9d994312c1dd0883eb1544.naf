<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro rises on view Irish debt crisis may be easing * Rally seen as driven by speculators, event risk looms * Spain bond auction goes smoothly but yields higher * Stocks, higher-yielding currencies gain  (Adds quote, updates prices) By Neal Armstrong LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The euro rallied on Thursday asoptimism that Ireland's debt crisis may be easing fuelledspeculative buying, but the move was seen as undermined byperipheral risks elsewhere and position-squaring into theyear-end. The dollar was broadly softer after subdued U.S. inflationdata on Wednesday reinforced the U.S. Federal Reserve's case formonetary easing. "We view this as a short-term speculative rally in the euro,driven by weaker U.S. CPI and some optimism for Ireland as theIMF and EU arrive in Dublin for talks," said Manuel Oliveri,currency analyst at UBS in Zurich. "There are other factors at play for the dollar. Year-endflows should be supportive as profit-taking versus emergingcurrencies fuels repatriation," he said. Uncertainty about the Irish crisis, which has also supportedthe dollar recently, looked to be loosening its grip on marketsafter Dublin agreed to work with a European Union-InternationalMonetary Fund mission on urgent steps to shore up its shatteredbanking sector. The cost of insuring Irish debt against default fell asinvestors grew increasingly confident that a deal would bereached. The euro hit a session high of $1.3664 to the dollar. As of1225 GMT, it was up 0.9 percent on the day at $1.3645. Thesingle currency had hit a seven-week low of $1.3446 on Tuesday. Traders said stop-losses were triggered on the break ofIchimoku resistance at $1.3630. The next resistance was seen at$1.3765, the 38.2 percent retracement of this month's fall."IMF involvement points powerfully towards funding supportfor Ireland, probably to ring-fence the banks, which reducesrisks to some extent," said Ray Farris, currency strategist atCredit Suisse. "But this is not a silver bullet for Ireland. The Irishbudget and election are its next event risks," he said. The euro is still down some 5 percent from a 10-month highabove $1.4280 set on Nov. 4.     Some analysts saying that even if there a quickresolution is reached over Ireland, players would fret aboutother peripheral euro zone economies and their debt levels, withPortugal thought to be in the market's sights. A Spanish bond auction passed relatively smoothly, as itsold 3.7 billion euros worth of 10 and 30-year bonds, albeit athigher yields.    Against the yen, the euro rose 1.0 percent to113.82 yen.  RISK-ON Investors' risk appetite drove U.S. stock futures up 1.1percent, and higher-yielding currencies also gained. TheAustralian dollar rose 1 percent to $0.9900, up from this week'slow around $0.9726. "It is a risk-on environment today, and we are seeing anoutperformance of riskier assets," said Christian Lawrence,currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Subsequently, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback'sperformance against a basket of major currencies, dropped 0.8percent to 78.438, off Tuesday's seven-week high of 79.461. Data on Wednesday showed U.S. core consumer inflation rose0.6 percent from a year ago, the smallest increase since recordsstarted in 1957 and backing up the case for the Fed to deliverall of its $600 billion of quantitative easing. Traders also say hedge funds are likely to close dollarshort positions ahead of their book-closing later in the year. The dollar, which gained 4 percent from a 15-year low to ahigh of 83.60 yen this month, held at 83.20 yen. (Additional reporting by Tamawa Desai; Editing by Hugh Lawson)             ]]></raw>
