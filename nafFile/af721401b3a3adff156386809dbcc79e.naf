Regional power plant Kauno Termofikacine Elektrine (KTE),owned by Gazprom, said on its website the Russian firm wantedthe compensation for losses allegedly incurred in 2003-2008. It quoted a letter sent by Gazprom to Lithuanian PrimeMinister Andrius Kubilius. "It is estimated that the Russian gas consortium ... lost342.2 million litas ($134.6 million) due to the Lithuaniangovernment changing the methodology of setting heating prices,"the website said. "Therefore, Gazprom has proposed to reach an amicablesettlement with Lithuania ... for it to pay that sum ascompensation for the loss suffered." The letter said Gazprom would seek international arbitrationif necessary. The Lithuanian government said in a statement it was a thirdparty and that Gazprom's compensation claim arose from a disputebetween KTE and Kauno Energija -- a utility company owned by theKaunas municipality. Kauno Energija declined to comment on Gazprom's compensationclaim. But it said on Feb. 17 in a statement there had been acommercial arbitration in a dispute over an investmentprotection treaty and KTE should pay it 5.4 million litas. Russia is the only supplier of natural gas to the ex-SovietBaltic republic. Gazprom is a major shareholder in the gas companies of allthree Baltic states, along with German E.ON Ruhrgas.
