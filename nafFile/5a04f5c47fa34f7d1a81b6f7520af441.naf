<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The Australian dollar rose against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday, but market sentiment remained under pressure amid growing fears that this week’s European summit will produce no new moves to tackle the region’s sovereign debt crisis. AUD/USD hit 1.0036 during late Asian trade, the daily high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.0023, adding 0.13%.The pair was likely to find support at 0.9956, the low of May 14 and resistance at 1.0088, the high of June 15.Markets were jittery after German Chancellor Angela Merkel crushed any hopes that euro zone countries will eventually issue common Eurobonds to help indebted nations, calling such an idea “economically wrong” and “counterproductive”. Meanwhile, Greece’s new finance minister was forced to resign on Monday, due to health issues, while Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said he would not be able to attend this week’s EU summit given that he had just undergone eye surgery.Sentiment was also under pressure after Moody’s ratings agency downgraded 28 Spanish banks late Monday, citing exposure to the ailing real estate market. The decision came after Spain formally requested up to EUR100 billion in rescue loans to recapitalize its struggling banks.In addition, Cyprus became the fifth euro zone country to request financial help from Brussels, adding to concerns over the level of debt contagion in the single currency bloc.  Elsewhere, the Aussie was higher against the euro with EUR/AUD falling 0.14%, to hit 1.2474.Also Tuesday, a report by the Gfk market research agency showed that its index of consumer climate in Germany rose unexpectedly in June, ticking up to 5.8 from a reading of 5.7 the previous month. Analysts had expected the index to remain unchanged at 5.7.Later in the day, the U.S. was to release industry data on house price inflation, followed by a report on consumer confidence.             ]]></raw>
