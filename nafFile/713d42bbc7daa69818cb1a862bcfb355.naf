<raw><![CDATA[ By Ingrid Melander ATHENS, May 4 (Reuters) - Greece has signed up to a packageof austerity measures designed to cut its deficit by 11percentage points between 2009 and 2014, an aim that will deepenthe recession and could spark a social backlash. The measures agreed this weekend with the EU and IMF includemore tax hikes and steeper cuts in wages and bonuses, in returnfor a record 110 billion euro ($146.5 billion) bailout.[ID:nLDE64107I] According to the aid plan, Greece will have to save an extra30 billion euros on top of tough measures already taken but willtake two years longer than initially planned to bring its budgetdeficit below 3 percent of GDP. Markets have reacted coolly to the bailout package, withinvestors concerned about its viability and the impact offurther belt-tightening on an economy already in recession. EU and IMF officials warned Greece would have to take moreausterity steps if those already agreed are not enough to meetfiscal targets. [ID:nLAW002135] Based on conversations with analysts and comparisons withother EU/IMF bailouts, here are three scenarios Greece faces,with implications for financial markets:  GOVERNMENT MEETS FISCAL TARGETS SCENARIO: Helped by the extra austerity measures and asuccessful crackdown on waste and tax evasion, the governmentmanages to cut the deficit by 11 percentage points by 2014. PROBABILITY: Low. Analysts say the new target to cut thedeficit below 3 percent in 2014 is more realistic than theprevious 2012 target, but say risks are still high, withincreasing public opposition and a bleak economic outlookthe main dangers. The additional austerity measures will hurt an economyalready in the doldrums, pushing GDP down 4.0 percent this yearand by 2.6 percent in 2011, according to the government. Thiswould amount to Greece's longest recession in 30 years.Deflation would complicate plans to keep debt levels steadybetween 2011 and 2013, and reduce them from 2014. Public opposition to the measures has been rather muted sofar but is on the rise and analysts say keeping public backingfor three years of austerity will be tough as Greeks are proneto street protests and reluctant to pay taxes. MARKET IMPLICATIONS: A deficit cut of 11 percentage pointsby 2014 would be a positive surprise for investors and make iteasier for Greece to tap financial markets sooner.  GREECE WIDELY MISSES BUDGET TARGETS SCENARIO: The economy shrinks more than expected or does notstart growing again in 2012, with tax revenues collapsing andGreece widely missing its deficit targets. PROBABILITY: Average. The chances of widely missing thetargets will increase if the recession is deeper than the 4percent contraction forecast for this year or persists longerthan forecast. Social unrest could intensify if the unemployment ratepushes over 11 percent and that could prevent Prime MinisterGeorge Papandreou's government from pushing reforms. Labourunions have already vowed to resist further austerity. Even without social unrest, cutting deficits in times ofeconomic downturn is extremely difficult, as shown by theexamples of three non-euro-zone EU states that pledged to trimpublic finance shortfalls as part of EU and IMF aid packages. Latvia agreed with the IMF to aim for a fiscal deficit of 5percent of GDP last year but ended with almost double that afterausterity measures exacerbated an economic contraction of 18percent that was more than three times worse than forecast. IMF borrower Romania also saw its deficit rise from anoriginal pledge of 4.6 percent of GDP in 2009 to 8.3 percent,and Hungary targeted a 2.9 percent of GDP deficit, but finishedat 4 percent. All three had to renegotiate targets. MARKET IMPLICATIONS: Political instability in Greece wouldstrongly damage hopes of Greece managing its debt, increasingthe prospects of a debt restructuring or default. This wouldraise pressure on Greece to withdraw from the euro zone, atleast temporarily, and could undermine the credibility of theEuropean single currency. It would also raise market pressure oneuro zone periphery states like Portugal and Spain, potentiallymaking it more expensive for them to borrow.  GREECE CUTS DEFICIT MODERATELY, MISSES TARGET SCENARIO: Greece implements reforms but the new measureslead to a deeper recession that prevents the government fromfully meeting its deficit-cutting targets. PROBABILITY: High. The Greek public sector is in suchdisarray that even elementary spending and structural reformscould generate significant deficit cuts, despite the recession.The government has already legislated wage and pension cuts inthe public sector of about 2.7 billion euros. Defence spending cuts of 460 million euros are alsounderway. The government has capped pharmaceuticals prices byabout 1 billion euros to limit hospital spending. The EU haspledged to speed up disbursement of an extra 1.4 billion eurosearmarked for infrastructure. But a deeper recession would mean higher unemployment andcast doubt on plans to save an additional 30 billion eurosthrough public spending cuts and increased tax collection. MARKET IMPLICATIONS: A slower than forecast deficit cut would not be a surprise but would create the impression thatGreece has fallen short of its targets, possibly weighing oninvestor confidence and delaying the nation's return to markets.(Additional reporting by Harry Papachristou and Mike Winfrey;Editing by Noah Barkin, John Stonestreet)             ]]></raw>
