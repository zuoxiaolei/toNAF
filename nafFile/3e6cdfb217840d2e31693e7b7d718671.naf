<raw><![CDATA[ * Few question that China's yuan is undervalued * Many doubt currency changes will increase jobs * Multilateral approach could be better(Corrects second Indonesia reference to India in paragraph19) By Paul Eckert WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - China's currency isclearly undervalued, but pressure on Beijing to make itscurrency rise in value won't trim the U.S. trade deficit withChina or reduce the jobless rate, say American economists. Political pressure is building on the Obama administrationto name China a "currency manipulator" in a mid-April report,and lawmakers are threatening to slap tariffs on Chinese goodsto offset any export subsidy a cheap currency gives China. However, many trade economists and businessmen say that atbest, a heavy-handed U.S. approach on currency will fail. Atworst, it could backfire, sparking a U.S.-China trade war. Instead, Washington should address the currency and otherfactors behind global financial imbalances in a multilateralsetting. Bilaterally, the Americans should focus on Chinesetrade barriers that suppress sales to China and may violateWorld Trade Organization (WTO) commitments, they say. "The currency is undervalued, period. It's also astructural distortion because the world's second-largesteconomy shouldn't be pegging to the largest economy," saidDerek Scissors of the Heritage Foundation in Washington. Economists say China's currency is pegged to the dollar ata rate that is between 15 and 40 percent lower than the levelmarkets would set if the yuan were freely traded. Slamming the Chinese over currency is politically appealing in an election year in which U.S. unemployment is near 10percent and China's trade surplus is expanding again. JOBS AND TRADE Economically, however, "this is a dead end," warnedScissors. "If you're looking to create jobs, the currencychange won't do it." "The Chinese have reserved large parts of their market forthe state -- by rules, by subsidies, by everything you canimagine -- and that's the big cap on U.S. exports, not thecurrency," he said. The U.S. Trade Representative's office on Wednesday issuedan annual report that cited a range of Chinese regulations,subsidies and policies that favor state firms over foreignfirms and contravene China's WTO obligations. Earlier this month, the left-leaning Economic PolicyInstitute issued a study that said China's "currencymanipulation" and other trade policies caused the loss of asmany as 2.4 million U.S. jobs between 2001 and 2008. With the U.S. economy having shed 8.4 million jobs sinceDecember 2007, many U.S. lawmakers have embraced thecurrency-unemployment nexus suggested in the EPI report. The U.S.-China Business Council, whose members do businessin China, retorted that the EPI analysis was "several decadeswrong" because China is merely the newest supplier of goodsthat its Asian neighbors used to sell to the U.S. market. Americans who blame job loss on China trade ignore all thejobs supported by imports and operate "on the faulty assumptionthat every product imported from China would have been made inthe U.S. otherwise," said John Frisbie, USCBC president.  Daniel Ikenson, an economist at the CATO Institute, saidthat when China eased the yuan-dollar peg between 2005 and2008, the Chinese currency appreciated 21 percent -- but U.S.imports from Chinese increased by 38.7 percent. "The currency issue is a problem because there's a falseassociation with the trade deficit and the trade deficit isfalsely associated with job loss," he said. MULTILATERALIZE IT? The EPI's Senior International Economist Robert Scott,author of the job report, shrugs off critics who say his callfor a sharp appreciation of the Chinese currency is futile. "If you make Chinese goods 40 percent more expensive andmake U.S. goods 40 percent less expensive, that's got to havean impact on ultimate sales of goods in both countries andultimately, on jobs," he said. But Scissors counters that a Chinese currency appreciationwould simply make "jobs move to other countries that arelow-cost producers who couldn't quite catch up to the Chinesebut now they can: Vietnam, Indonesia, Mexico, India." Speculation about how the U.S. Treasury Department willhandle the semi-annual currency report due on April 15 hasswung from predictions of a strong likelihood that China willbe cited to talk that Treasury might postpone the decision. The Bush administration often put off the finding to avoidfriction with Beijing ahead of key events, and neither theObama administration nor its predecessor has ever declaredChina a manipulator. The Obama administration is hosting a nuclear disarmamentsummit on April 12-13 that it hopes Chinese President Hu Jintaowill attend. U.S. cabinet officials will travel to Beijing foran annual strategic and economic dialogue meeting in late May. A currency manipulator ruling simply requires Washingtonenter into consultations with China and the InternationalMonetary Fund. Some analysts say that would be a good thingbecause it would "multilateralize" a testy bilateral disputeand stave off broad protectionist moves by the U.S. Congress.
