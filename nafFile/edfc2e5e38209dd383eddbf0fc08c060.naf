<raw><![CDATA[© Reuters.  Dollar holds onto gains vs. rivals amid rate hike hopesInvesting.com - The dollar remained broadly higher against the other major currencies in quiet trade on Monday, as Friday's strong U.S. jobs data continued to fuel expectations for a December rate hike by the Federal Reserve, supporting demand for the greenback.USD/JPY added 0.15% to 123.30.The dollar strengthened broadly after the Labor Department reported on Friday that the U.S. economy added 211,000 jobs last month, after increasing an upwardly revised 298,000 in October.The unemployment rate held steady at 5% in November. Economists had forecast jobs growth of 200,000 and no change in the unemployment rate.The report hardened expectations that the Fed will hike interest rates for the first time since 2006 at its upcoming meeting on December 15-16.
