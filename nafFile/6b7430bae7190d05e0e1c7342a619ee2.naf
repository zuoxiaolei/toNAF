<raw><![CDATA[   * C$ ends at 96.74 U.S. cents, rebounds from 1-week low * Bond prices lower across the curve (Updates to close, adds details, quotes) By Claire Sibonney TORONTO, May 17 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar pared steeplosses against the U.S. currency on Monday, but still endedslightly lower as global risk aversion continued to play outover nagging worries about Europe's debt crisis.  The euro also rallied from a four-year low versus thegreenback, helped by a turnaround in U.S. stocks, whichtemporarily offset fears that euro zone austerity measurescould trigger a downturn in the region. [FRX/] "I think the market just needs to a get a little morecomfortable with what's transpired, plus the new valuation foreuro, plus what lies ahead for the euro zone itself," saidCamilla Sutton, currency strategist at Scotia Capital. Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said Europe wasfollowing the right path to manage the debt crisis, and saidthere were no signs the crisis was spreading beyond Greece,Spain and Portugal. [ID:nSGE64G0G1] Also weighing on the commodity-linked currency, crudeprices fell below $70 a barrel, pushed down by concerns aboutEurope's economy, the weak euro, swollen U.S. oil inventoriesand worries that China's growth may be slowing [O/R] With no major economic announcements or key euro zonedevelopments to take direction from, Sutton said the market wastrying to stabilize. The Canadian dollar  closed the North Americansession at C$1.0337 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.74 U.S. cents,down from Friday's finish at C$1.0317 to the U.S. dollar, or96.93 U.S. cents. Earlier, in the overnight session, the currency fell to itslowest level in more than a week at C$1.0440 to the U.S.dollar, or 95.79 U.S. cents, caught in the crossfire of euroselling. "I think as we look ahead, Canada should still strengthen,"Sutton said. "On a relative basis it's poised to do quite well. So wewould expect it to continue to strengthen once we get throughthis spike in risk aversion." Sutton said key levels of support and resistance for thecurrency rest between the 100-day moving average of C$1.0316 tothe U.S. dollar and the 200-day moving average of C$1.0494. BONDS ALSO PRESSURED Canadian government bond prices were lower across the curveas investors awaited key retail sales and inflation data laterin the week. "We know the Bank of Canada is going (to raise interestrates) in June or it's going in July. We know that the bank iscompletely data-dependent at this point," said said IanPollick, a portfolio strategist at TD Securities. "Those are the two real last pieces of information we need... That will really give us a good sense of what the bank isgoing to do." Bond prices tend to fall when interest rates go up as theirlow-yielding fixed payments seem less lucrative compared withrising yields on other investments. The two-year government bond  dipped 11 Canadiancents to C$99.25 to yield 1.877 percent, while the 10-year bond Canadian bonds lagged their U.S. counterparts with theCanadian 10-year bond yield almost 2 basis basis points abovethe U.S. 10-year yield, compared with 2.2 basis points below onFriday. "Today's just one of those days where we're seeing lightflows across the market. It's pretty much dead to be honestwith you," said Pollick.
