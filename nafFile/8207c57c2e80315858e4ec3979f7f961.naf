<raw><![CDATA[ * Says fiscal leg will be sufficiently strengthened * Inflation rise temporary * Stress tests need to be tougher, but not too much  (Adds quotes, background, comments on inflation) BRATISLAVA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Stronger fiscal coordinationamong euro zone countries will form a sufficient basis for thesurvival of the single currency, European Central Bank GoverningCouncil member Jozef Makuch said on Wednesday. Speaking at an economic seminar, Makuch echoed comments byfellow central bankers that inflation in the euro area couldrise further above the bank's 2 percent target in the first halfbut fall back after that. European governments have been discussing ways to strengthenthe euro zone's fiscal framework to avoid profligacy amongmember states which led to Europe's debt crisis. Makuch said he was optimistic about the euro's futurebecause the crisis was a fiscal one and it was being addressed. "The optimism that the euro will survive is optimismstemming from (the fact that) large fiscal projects are beingimplemented not only in those countries directly threatened butalso in others," Makuch told an economic conference inBratislava. "There is an assumption that the fiscal leg, although notfull-fledged ... is strengthening, and it will be sufficient tohold up the euro together with the monetary leg." European leaders have been discussing a number of measuresto boost fiscal discipline in the euro zone and at the same timeboost the capacity of the main debt crisis-relief tool, theEuropean Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). No specific decisions have yet been taken -- and may not beuntil EU leaders meet to discuss next steps at a summit on March24-25 -- but trial balloons and proposals are being releasedthat suggest some of the tactics under consideration.   Echoing other ECB policymakers, Makuch said an inflationrise above the ECB's target of below but close to 2 percent wasa temporary problem."It (inflation rise) has so far been viewed as a temporaryissue, it can go a little higher in the first half but then itshould get toward the ECB's long-term target," he said. Makuch said the euro zone's next round of banking stresstests must be based on stricter criteria than last year's testswhich failed to reveal risks in banks' balance sheets, but atthe same time an overly strict approach would also be wrong. Another ECB Governing Council member Marko Kranjec, whoheads Slovenia's central bank, said on Wednesday the next roundof EU bank stress tests would be conducted in February and thecriteria for banks would be much tougher than tests carried outlast year.
