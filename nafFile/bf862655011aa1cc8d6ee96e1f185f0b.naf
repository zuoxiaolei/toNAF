<raw><![CDATA[ * Members can tap fund in case of FX liquidity squeeze * First move by Asia to protect itself from crisis * Scheme seen nowhere near European Union-styleintegration (Updates with details) By Yoo Choonsik SEOUL, Dec 28 (Reuters) - East and Southeast Asiancountries said on Monday it will launch a $120 billionemergency fund in March, the first such alliance in the regionto shield itself from a financial crisis. Under the scheme, known as the Chiang Mai InitiativeMultilateralization (CMIM), Japan, China, South Korea, HongKong and the 10 members of the Association of Southeast AsianNations (ASEAN) can each swap its own currency into U.S.dollars in case of a liquidity crunch. "The core objectives of the CMIM are to address balance ofpayment and short-term liquidity difficulties in the region andto supplement the existing international financialarrangements," a joint statement said. The four non-ASEAN members committed the bulk of money tothe fund, which will be launched on March 24. The move comes as Asian economies have been leading theworld out of the worst economic downturn in several decades andamid increasing calls for global economic diplomacy, especiallywithin the Group of 20 arena. Policymakers in Asia, home to seven of the world's top 10holders of foreign reserves, have agreed on the need to pursuea stronger alliance within the region to avert the repeat ofthe 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. But analysts say the region is nowhere close to setting upa full equivalent of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or aEuropean Union-style regime. Some also say the CMIM is partly hamstrung as access to 80percent of the available funds is tied to conditions set by theIMF, which is seen in Asia to have mismanaged the 1997/98crisis. "The launch of the CMIM marks an important achievement instrengthening the region's capability to counter a short-termliquidity crisis and putting the intra-regional financialcooperation onto a higher level," South Korea's financeministry said in a statement. The ASEAN Plus Three first agreed in May to set up the fundby transforming a network of mostly bilateral currency swaparrangements between the member economies, valued at $78billion, into a single $120 billion pool of funds committed bythe members.
