<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar touches lows vs Swiss franc, euro, sterling * Euro tests barriers at $1.5050 but gains short-lived * Sterling advances on short-covering ahead of Q3 GDP * Yen falls on crosses as fundamentals return to focus By Kaori Kaneko TOKYO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The dollar ground to its latest lowfor the year against the euro on Friday as the market took aim atoptions barriers, while sterling, a laggard in the broad rallyagainst the dollar, rose ahead of UK growth data. The dollar has been under persistent pressure this year overexpectations that U.S. interest rates will remain low for a longtime, a view reconfirmed on Thursday by Chicago Federal ReservePresident Charles Evans who said policy accommodation was stillthe top priority. With that view intact, talk of options triggers up at$1.5050 on euro/dollar encouraged dollar selling, although thefall was not substantial and the euro quickly ran into salesafter hitting a 14-month high at $1.5061. Sterling rose to its highest in a month against thegreenback, extending a steep rebound from a five-month lowearlier in October as short-term speculators have covered shortpositions. One trader said the short-covering looked to be nearly overbut had given the pound a bit more upward drive ahead of GDP datadue at 0830 GMT, which may show Britain returned to growthbetween July and September after five quarters of recession. "After (BOE Governor) King's recent bullish comments, if GDPis good, that will help sterling," said said Kazuyuki Kato,treasury department manager at Mizuho Trust & Banking. "But the pace of sterling's gains will likely moderate asspeculator short-covering nears its end." The pound rose 0.2 percent on the day to $1.6651, afterclimbing as high as $1.6679. Minutes from the Bank of England and comments from itsgovernor Mervyn King have encouraged views that it may not extendits 175 billion pound ($290.8 billion) quantitative easing nextmonth, although another BOE policy maker threw that back intodoubt on Thursday.The euro got a bit of a leg up this week when it crossed apsychological barrier at $1.5000. Traders said the next set ofoptions triggers were thought to lie around $1.5050, which wereduly tested and the level broken. The euro returned to stand flat on the day at $1.5034 but atrader for a Japanese trust bank said the market was alreadyeyeing $1.5100 as the next target, although he said the euro'srise might be gradual. The dollar also dipped briefly to a 15-month low at 1.0033Swiss francs but was holding just above a 14-month low against abasket of six major currencies set this week at 74.94. It was steady on the day at 75.082, although some in themarket are not ruling out an eventual fall to a March 2008 lowaround 70.7. Since April, the dollar index has lost about 12 percent,with selling picking up in recent weeks as Asian central banksdiversified into other currencies, and on growing talk the dollaris becoming the funding currency for leveraged carry trades. "The U.S. dollar looks vulnerable to a short, brutal moveto the spring 2008 lows," said David Watt, senior currencystrategist at RBC Capital. But it rose against the yen, gaining 0.4 percent on the dayto 91.66 yen as the Japanese currency was sold against the higheryielding Australian dollar and the British pound. Dealersexpected resistance at 91.75 yen and then around 92.30. Traders said speculative accounts were growing doubtful aboutJapan's currency, with some building yen-selling positions ondomestic issues which did not bode well for the economic outlook,such as a crisis at cash-strapped Japan Airlines and concernsabout rising government debt supply. The Australian dollar was up 0.5 percent at 84.96 yen afterhitting a one-year high at 85.02 yen. The euro rose 0.4 percent to 137.75, touching its highest intwo months, and sterling to a one-month high of 152.65 yen. Datawise, investors will look to the euro zone provisionalOctober PMI data and German IFO index, while in the U.S.Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke speaks at 1230 GMT.
