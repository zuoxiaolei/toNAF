Adjusted for oil reserves and oil products revaluation,operating profit is expected to be slightly negative, thecompany said. In the first quarter of 2010, Unipetrol's operating profitwas 517 million crowns ($93.57 million). In the fourth quarter2010, the petrochemical group, majority owned by Poland's PKNOrlen, showed operating profit at 122 million crowns. Exchange rate developments helped boost Unipetrol's resultby 100 million crowns in the period, the company added in thestatement.
