<raw><![CDATA[ * Wall St pares gains after reports of Korea ship sinking * Euro climbs on news of accord on Greece safety net * Oil sheds gains as U.S. GDP data dents bullish mood (Updates with close of European markets) By Herbert Lash and Jennifer Ablan NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - Global stocks slipped andgovernment debt prices edged higher on Friday as worries aboutthe sinking of a South Korean naval ship dashed optimism over astandby financial aid accord for debt-stricken Greece. Seoul played down reports that one of its navy ships withmore than 100 people on board may have been hit by an allegedNorth Korean torpedo attack. For details see: [ID:nnSGE62P0GW] Market sentiment turned quickly on news of the unconfirmedattack, with global stocks paring gains to turn negative andthe CBOE's volatility index , often referred to as WallStreet's fear gauge, turning positive after being down about 4percent. "We've been seeing a lot of concern today specifically onthe situation over in the Koreas. That's got people's attentionright now," said Dave Lutz of Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore. "Aside from that we're seeing very low volume. It kind offeels like a buyers' strike," he said. The ship's sinking curbed enthusiasm about a deal unveiledlate Thursday under which Greece would receive both bilateralloans from its euro zone partners and International MonetaryFund funding if Athens faced severe difficulties.[ID:nLDE62N2R1] Shortly after 1 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.44 points, or 0.01 percent, at 10,842.65. TheStandard & Poor's 500 Index  was down 1.39 points, or0.12 percent, at 1,164.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 7.74 points, or 0.32 percent, at 2,389.67. European shares closed lower, with drug makers giving upsome recent gains and energy companies lower on weaker crudeoil prices, after data showed that the U.S. economy grew latelast year at a slightly less brisk pace than the government hadpreviously estimated. Gross domestic product expanded at a 5.6 percent annualrate, the U.S. Commerce Department said in its final report forthe fourth quarter, instead of the 5.9 percent pace earlierreported. [ID:nN26185940] U.S. Treasuries slid, keeping benchmark yields nearnine-month highs, as the market remained under pressure in thewake of poorly-bid debt auctions this week. Prices edged higherafter news of the South Korean ship sinking. [ID:nN26135476] The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up7/32 in price to yield 3.86 percent. The euro rose broadly after euro-zone leaders agreed on thesafety net for Greece, although uncertainties remained over thecountry's long-term fiscal soundness. [ID:nN26141303] The euro  was up 0.86 percent against the dollar at$1.3392. The plan did not alleviate longer-term worries about Greeceand other fiscally vulnerable economies in the region, such asPortugal and Spain, limiting the euro's gains. The package "reduces some of the biggest risks on Greeceand we are obviously seeing the euro respond to that," saidDaniel Katzive, a director for global foreign exchange atCredit Suisse in New York. "But ultimately, the markets remain apprehensive over theirfiscal situation and it will be hard for the euro to gain realtraction against the dollar in the short term," he said. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For a graphic on the euro zone crisis seehttp://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/0210/EUROZONE_REPORT.html ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies,with the U.S. Dollar Index  down 0.49 percent at 81.72. Against the yen, the dollar  was down 0.18 percent at92.51. Yields of Greek government bonds fell and outperformedbenchmark German Bunds after the Greece accord, but thecountry's large, upcoming refinancing needs temperedenthusiasm. [ID:nLDE62P1UD] "The imminent risk of default has been lowered as a resultof the support plan," said Charles Diebel, strategist atNomura. However, the aid was not a quick fix for Greece'sfiscal problems, and had "only put a band-aid on it." Oil lost all its gains to trade under $80 a barrel afterthe data on the U.S. economy's growth rate in the fourthquarter of 2009 and the aid plan for Greece failed to quellconcerns of a still fragile recovery. [ID:nSGE62P08C] U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell 57 cents, or 0.71percent, to  $79.96 per barrel. Spot gold prices  rose $13.45 to $1,104.30 an ounce.
