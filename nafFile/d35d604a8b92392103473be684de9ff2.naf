<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The New Zealand dollar declined against its U.S. counterpart on Friday, trimming a weekly gain as risk aversion sharpened after government data showed the U.S. economy added zero jobs in August, dampening demand for growth-linked currencies.  NZD/USD hit 0.8571 on Wednesday, the highest since August 4; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.8475 by close of trade on Friday, adding 0.75% on the week, the second consecutive weekly gain. The pair was likely to find support at 0.8384, the low of August 29 and resistance at 0.8571, Wednesday’s high and a four-week high. The U.S. Department of Labor said Friday that non-farm payrolls were unchanged last month, the weakest reading since September 2010. Economists had expected non-farm payrolls to rise by 74,000 in August.July’s figure was revised down to an increase of 85,000 from a previously reported 117,000. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 9.1% in August.The dismal jobs data prompted investors to shun riskier assets, such as stocks and high yielding currencies and flock to traditional safe haven assets like the yen, Swiss franc and gold.The kiwi came under further pressure as concerns grew that the euro zone’s sovereign debt crisis was worsening after negotiations between Greece’s government and the International Monetary Fund were suspended after the debt-laden country failed to meet deficit reduction targets.        The cost of insuring Greek sovereign debt against default surged to a euro-lifetime high following the news, adding to worries over a potential default. The kiwi jumped to a four-week high of 0.8571 on Wednesday after official data showed that the number of building permits issued in New Zealand in July rose the most since April 2008, jumping by 13%, after declining by a revised 1.0% in June.
