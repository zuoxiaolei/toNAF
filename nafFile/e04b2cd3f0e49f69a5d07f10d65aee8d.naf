<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar/Swiss and euro/Swiss firm * Traders cite talk of SNB intervening in FX forwards * Euro slips vs dollar as Europe shares fall (Updates prices)	 By Anirban Nag	 LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc fell against theeuro and the dollar on Thursday, with traders citing talk theSwiss National Bank was intervening in the forwards market aspart of efforts to curb the surging currency.	 The dollar rose against commodity-linked currencies like theAustralian dollar while the yen was supported asEuropean stocks fell and money market strains drove investors tothe relative safety of the U.S. and Japanese currencies.	 The dollar gained 0.8 percent to 0.7966 francs whilethe euro rose 0.4 percent to 1.1440 francs , havingearlier climbed to 1.1515.	 "They (the SNB) have been in the FX swap market," said ChrisWalker, currency strategist at UBS. "But we think the euro/Swissfranc will still fall back towards parity."	 The franc soared to record highs against the dollar and theeuro earlier this month in a rush towards perceived safe havenssparked by euro zone sovereign debt worries and concerns about aglobal slowdown.	 In a fresh attempt to tame the franc's runaway rise, the SNBsaid on Wednesday it would boost liquidity by expanding sightdeposits to 200 billion francs from 120 billion, and said itwould take additional steps if needed.	 The SNB on Thursday declined to comment on the latest talkthat it was intervening in the forwards market. 	 Forward market intervention involves selling Swiss francs inshort-dated maturities to flood the market with francs,then buying them back or rolling them over at a later date.	 Traders said by undertaking franc-selling operations in theforwards instead of in the spot market, the SNB was seeking todrive the return on holding francs even lower, making it lessattractive to potential investors.	 Swiss money market rates moved deeper into negativeterritory. The December 2011 Euroswiss contract traded at100.51, implying a three-month Swiss franc Libor rate of -0.51percent in December. <0#FES:> The contract has risen from around100.04 at the start of the week, implying the SNB's action wasworking for the moment.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	 Swiss intervention threat to cap big franc gains	  SCENARIOS-What Switzerland could do to fight strong franc	  FACTBOX-Swiss govt measures to counter strong franc	  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	  GLOBAL GROWTH PANGS	 Meanwhile, the dollar index was up 0.5 percent at74.088 while the euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.4351 ,tracking a 2.5 percent fall in European shares . 	 Technical support around $1.4360, the euro's 100-day movingaverage, and bids seen at $1.4350 were expected to limit furtherbig losses, while steady sovereign demand at lower levels hasbeen a pillar of support for the single currency. 	 However, a lack of more radical measures from Tuesday'sFranco-German summit to address the euro zone debt crisis andlingering worries about some large European banks are likely tokeep the euro under downward pressure. 	 It was lower against the yen at 110.10 yen whilethe dollar was flat at 76.54 yen , not far from its recordlow of 76.25 yen struck in March.	 Traders said the greenback could test this record low nextweek, when most Japanese players return from holidays and asJapanese exporters may sell the dollar in end-of-the-month transactions.	 One factor that could weigh broadly on the dollar is marketspeculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may eventually launchanother asset-buying programme.  	 Investors are focusing on whether Fed Chairman Ben Bernankewill drop any hints about such further monetary easing measureswhen he speaks at the annual Jackson Hole event next week.	 Before that, a slew of data on Thursday will provide clueson whether further U.S. stimulus will be needed. Consumer priceinflation data, the Philly Fed survey, initial unemploymentclaims, existing home sales and leading indicators are all due .	 "The most important one will be the CPI and the market ispositioned towards a stable to slightly lower number," said AdamMyers, senior currency strategist at Credit Agricole.	 "If we get a lower number, Bernanke may prepare the groundfor more QE but a higher-than-expected number will make thatcase difficult and could see the dollar rally."	 The dollar's gains against commodity-linked currenciespushed the Australian dollar down 0.7 percent to $1.0460 .
