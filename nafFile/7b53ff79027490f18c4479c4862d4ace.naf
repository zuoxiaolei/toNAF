<raw><![CDATA[ In one of the most blatant recent cases, a formerconservative environment minister was caught building a summerhouse near Athens with an expired permit. He was not sacked. But no scandal has shaken Greece in recent years more than amonastery land swap that helped bring down the conservativegovernment in 2009 and illustrated the state's failure to takeadvantage of its own assets. In 2008, monks at the wealthy MountAthos monastery of Vatopedi convinced government officials toexchange cheap farmland for prime Athens real estate, in a dealthat cost taxpayers millions of euros in lost land value.Despite parliamentary investigations, no senior politician hasso far been charged. Such scandals have created suspicion among voters who seepoliticians and their business friends profiting from opaquereal estate trades with seeming impunity. For the privatisationplans to work, local property experts say, they will have to besqueaky clean. "It must be so transparent that it convinces everyonenothing dirty lurks behind, nothing suspicious that will makesome rich from stealing the people's property," said AristotelisKarytinos, head of group real estate at the National Bank ofGreece (NBG), the country's largest commercial bank.  'WE MUST CHANGE' But there's a problem with that: corruption helps grease theslow wheels of bureaucracy. Red tape can delay projects for years, said Yannis Perrotis,managing director of CB Richard Ellis-Atria and part of acommittee set up in 2003 by the then-socialist government totarget one billion euros in state property development. Thatplan was interrupted when the conservative New Democracy partycame to power in 2004, and then again when the Vatopedimonastery scandal broke. While small local developers can virtually raise buildingsanywhere, for a major foreign investor red tape is adisincentive. "Many foreigners have had very bad experiencesgoing through unimaginable troubles from Greek bureaucracy,"said Karytinos. Even if the problems of corruption and bureaucracy are dealtwith, things can get tangled quickly for other reasons. The airport at Hellenikon is exhibit A. The government hopesbulldozers will start work there for the project with Qatar --which it says was attracted by the unique location of the site-- as early as the first quarter of 2012. That would give Greecea much-needed psychological boost and give a signal to investorsthat Greece can work. "Hellenikon will add value, create jobs and motivate theinternational business community. It is a womb that will bearmany children," said Harris Pamboukis, State Minister in chargeof major projects, in March. But the project's opponents, led by mayor Kortzidis, aredetermined to stop it. The soft-spoken leftist admits thatfinancially strapped local municipalities cannot afford tomaintain the huge public park he is fighting for, but insiststhey will fight all the same. His town hall in the southwesternAthens suburb of Argyroupoli is a picture of neglect, withpeeling paint and littered steps. "Just because we can't take care of a square doesn't mean wehave to hand it over to private interests. We must change, wemust do things better ourselves," said Kortzidis. Greece has a long history of protesters blocking projects.Neighbours held up the construction of the new Acropolis Museumfor more than a decade. This time, the government says it isdetermined to avoid delays. "We will clash with anyone who has an agenda of doingnothing," said Pamboukis, the minister. "The only way to stop aproject is through the law. The government will be very tough onillegal actions which are often politically motivated." Qatar's interest in Hellenikon shows the demand is there, hesaid. "Foreign investors are interested in Hellenikon because itis rare, and rare is desirable. It will unblock things andinspire others and that is why the prime minister is urging usto go faster." Well, sort of. Prime Minister George Papandreou tried tocalm public disquiet by telling parliament in February that "notan inch of Greek land will be sold". That added to the confusion-- it seems to mean that only buildings would be sold, but landwould be leased or parcelled out using a more complexinstrument, such as a holding company selling shares toinvestors. In the current depressed international economy, suchdeals might be hard to sell. Apart from Qatar, demand for projects may come from China --its Cosco Pacific signed a 3.4 billion euro concession to runthe port of Piraeus in 2008 -- Russia or Japan. "No one else hasthe money," said one euro zone finance official, who discountedthe prospect of a European buyer. But potential buyers are wary. A Qatari consortium walkedaway from a 3.5 billion euro energy project in western Greece inOctober, a setback for Greek hopes to lure up to $5 billion ininvestment from the cash-rich Arab emirate. Government officialssaid at the time the two Qatari companies involved, QatarPetroleum and the Qatar Investment Authority, could not agreewith their Greek partners on the viability of the plan.  EXPENSIVE ODYSSEY Advisers to the government have so far issued a list of 20initial potential assets to sell, including land on the islandof Rhodes which might be turned into a golf course, and an areanext to the spectacular Rio-Antirio bridge near the western portcity of Patras that could be used for tourism or businessdevelopment. How much might Greece really own? A first glimpse came in areport last November by the ISTAME think tank, which put thevalue of property owned directly by the state at 272 billioneuros. This did not include tourist assets such as marinas,camping sites and spas, or Olympic Games venues that belong totwo different state organisations, and ISTAME admitted itsfigure may be way off. "Commercial value can certainly be more but it will hinge onhow one exploits it," said ISTAME President, Elias Mosialos, asocialist MP. "It depends on how it can be used, if it has legalor infringement issues, and if it can be developed." Greek officials and bankers started to bounce the 300billion euro figure off investors in London and New York duringtrips in late 2010. With the figures in the open, Europe and theIMF pushed harder and after an inspection visit in February aninitial government target of 1 billion euros in privatisationrevenues in 2011 was revised dramatically upwards, to the 2-3billion this year and 15 billion by 2013. Much rides on Hellenikon. Clinching a deal with Qatar andsmoothly launching the project will offer foreign investorsconcrete proof that things in Greece can change. But that willhave to be followed by an overhaul of the property anddevelopment laws. "We must offer projects that are ready to go,if possible with permits obtained to avoid such problems in thefuture," NBG's Karytinos said. This makes a no-go of sites redolent with historic appealthat draw millions of tourists every year. They are often soentangled in archaeological, environmental and legalrestrictions that from a property developer's point of viewthere's nothing to be done with them. That rules out landmarkslike the Acropolis, even though Germany's media have suggestedthat Greece sell it off to pay down its debts. "A monument may be priceless but it has no real estate valuebecause we are looking for development," Karytinos said. "Wemust look at what we have and how best to take advantage of itwithout getting stuck in Greece's legal jumble." Can Greece do it? Pamboukis said the effort will combine theexperience of the public sector with the international view anddynamism of the private sector. "Imagine it as a Greek Odyssey," he said. "Odysseus reachedIthaca following an idea. He didn't have a map but he made ithome." It took Odysseus a decade.
