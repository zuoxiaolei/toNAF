<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar falls vs yen on retail sales, jobless claims * ECB keeps rates on hold, Trichet mentions strong dlr * Aussie boosted by better-than-expected jobs data (Recasts throughout. Adds comments, details.) By Vivianne Rodrigues NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The dollar fell versus theJapanese yen on Thursday as lackluster U.S. data reinforced theview the Federal Reserve will keep rates on hold in theforeseeable future. But the dollar held gains versus the euro after theEuropean Central Bank kept policy unchanged as expected andPresident Jean-Claude Trichet reiterated the importance of astrong U.S. currency. Economic reports showed U.S. retail sales unexpectedly felllast month, while jobless claims rose last week. Analysts said the combination of Thursday's data with aweaker-than-expected payrolls report last Friday raised concernabout the outlook for the global recovery.   "The U.S. continues to recover at a really slow pace," saidJoe Manimbo, a currency trader at Travelex Global BusinessPayments, in Washington D.C. "If you add that to last week'sjobs data, that certainly dampens expectations of an early Fedrate hike. Consequently, that sets the stage for a weakerdollar." In morning trading in New York, the dollar was 0.15 percentdown at 91.25 yen, after hitting a session low of 91.13,according to Reuters data. It traded as high as 92.04 yenbefore the release of the data. The ECB kept its main interest rate on hold at a record lowof 1 percent for the eighth month running. It also left itsovernight deposit rate, which acts as a floor for moneymarkets, at 0.25 percent and its marginal lending rate at 1.75percent. The euro reacted little to the ECB decision but lost groundafter Trichet commented on the importance of a strong U.S.dollar. He also mentioned Greece and said the country had muchwork in front of it. The European currency was last 0.2 percent down on the dayat $1.4483 after trading as high as $1.4555 earlier. Investor confidence in Greece has fallen as its deficit hasballooned and credit ratings have been cut, which also weighedon the euro in the past couple of months. The Australian dollar rose against the yen and hit atwo-month high versus the U.S. dollar earlier after data showedAustralia's jobless rate at an eight-month low, adding to thecase for higher interest rates. The Australian dollar was last up 0.6 percent at $0.9297after hitting $0.9331, close to the 2009 high of $0.9407,according to Reuters data. Investors also awaited U.S. corporate earnings, withresults from Intel Corp. and JPMorgan Chase due out this week. (Additional reporting by Steven C.
