<raw><![CDATA[ * Japan finmin refuses specific comment on intervention * Banking min says intl coordination may be needed (Adds details, government and analyst comment) By Stanley White TOKYO, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Japan's finance minister raised theprospect of a Group of Seven joint statement on currencies tocool the yen's rally as the dollar tumbled to a 14-year lowagainst the yen on Friday. The greenback slumped to a low of 84.82 yen as investorsshunned riskier assets due to concerns about Dubai's debtproblems, but it pared its losses after comments by FinanceMinister Hirohisa Fujii. "I would respond flexibly to a joint statement oncurrencies," Fujii told reporters after a cabinet meeting. Fujii said he was also flexible about contacting currencyauthorities in the United States and Europe, adding that he wasvery nervous about currency moves and it was possible Japan couldrespond. He declined to comment on intervention, saying he was not ina position to use the word due to commitments with other G7countries on currency flexibility. Traders doubted if Fujii's comments were strong enough toreverse the greenback's slump, as joint intervention seemedunlikely. A joint statement might not be enough to rattleinvestors focused on the likelihood that interest rates in theUnited States will remain low and on worries about exposure toDubai's debts, traders say. The last time the G7 issued a statement on currencies was inOctober 2008, when rich countries warned that wild swings in theyen threatened financial stability after it surged to a 13-yearhigh against the dollar and a six-year peak versus the euro. Theyen rose after the statement as G7 countries stopped short ofactual intervention. "I would not be surprised if the G7 or the Group of 20 issuesa statement to prevent the dollar from weakening further,although it is unclear if they will act now or wait until a G7meeting in February," said Koji Fukaya, a senior currencystrategist at Deutsche Securities in Tokyo. "But the statement would unlikely be the kind issued inOctober last year, because the current situation stems from aweak dollar." The yen has risen 5.3 percent since the end of 2008. Intrade-weighted terms, its rise is also modest with the currencywell below highs hit in January. "I have not heard of intervention at this point but in thefuture there will be various options and if necessary I'll talkto ministers involved," National Strategy Minister Naoto Kan toldreporters. Japan's authorities intervened heavily earlier in the decadeto stop a rising yen from harming exports, but they stopped doingso in March 2004 after selling 35 trillion yen over a 15-monthperiod to shield a struggling economy. Japan's Democratic Party-led government, which swept to powerin an election in August, has criticised the previousadministration for catering to the country's exporters by keepingthe yen weak.But this criticism has come back to haunt the new government,in power for just two months, as the dollar's tumble against theyen threatens export earnings and could push the economy backinto recession. The pressure is mounting on Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama'sadministration as public support for his cabinet is slipping andthe Democrats face an election for the parliament's upper housenext year that will determine whether it can govern withoutneeding the support of two small coalition partners. The dollar has been falling broadly recently as expectationsthat interest rates in the United States will remain low,speculation that Japan won't intervene in currency markets, and about of risk aversion all snowballed into a sell-off. Banking Minister Shizuka Kamei also weighed in on thedollar's slump against the yen, saying he had talked to Fujiiabout coordinated international action.
