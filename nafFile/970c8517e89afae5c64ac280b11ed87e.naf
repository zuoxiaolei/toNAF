Market expectations were for retail sales to fall by 1.5% in July.Meanwhile, the euro was higher against both the British pound and the Japanese yen, with EUR/GBP up by 0.06% to hit 0.8847, and EUR/JPY rising 0.07% to hit 110.26.Weekly initial jobless claims data from the U.S. Department of Labor and the Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) for the euro zone were due for release later Thursday.             ]]></raw>
