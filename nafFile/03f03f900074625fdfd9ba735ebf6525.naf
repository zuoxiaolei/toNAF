<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar slips, more Fed QE likely to trigger selling * Open-ended approach from Fed the key to further weakness * Euro/dollar option expiries set to influence price action (Adds comment, updates prices)  By Neal Armstrong LONDON, Nov 3 (Reuters) -  The dollar edged lower onWednesday as the Federal Reserve looked set to add more stimulusto spur a flagging recovery, a move analysts said would weigh onU.S. yields and ultimately put more pressure on the greenback. Currency movements were subdued as investors were unwillingto make new bets ahead of the U.S. central bank's policydecision due at around 1815 GMT, with option expiries expectedto dictate price action. Markets were generally priced for the Fed initially tocommit to buying at least $500 billion in Treasuries over fivemonths in a fresh bout of quantitative easing, but traders wereeager for details of the scope and pace of bond purchases. "There is uncertainty over the details of the Fedannouncement but ultimately QE leads to lower yields and shouldmean the dollar goes down in the long term," said AdrianSchmidt, currency strategist at Lloyds Banking Group. The dollar slipped as much as 0.2 percent versus a currencybasket to 76.597. The euro inched up slightly on the day to $1.4050, held in a$1.4000/50 range for much of the European session. Optionexpiries at $1.4000 and $1.4050 later in the day were seeninfluencing intraday price action. Sterling hit a nine-month high of $1.6147 afterstronger-than-expected UK services sector activity dataadded to the argument that the Bank of England may not implementmore QE anytime soon.  LIQUIDITY DRIES UP Traders said liquidity had dried up since the start of theweek, with one trader in London saying his turnover in the pasttwo days had been the lowest in five years. He added the market was expecting the Fed announcement tooffer more clarity on whether the dollar's latest sell-off sinceSeptember would continue through the end of 2010. "The market is hoping the FOMC is going to break us out oneway or the other," the trader said, adding, "It could be thisweek gives us the last thing to focus on before year-end." Against the yen, the dollar stood at 80.62 yen, unchanged onthe day, as a Japanese holiday led to subdued trading, but theoutlook was still skewed to the downside. "Irrespective of recent ratcheting down of Fed QE2expectations from $1 trillion to $500 billion, a likelyopen-ended approach (of say $100 billion per month) should inour view keep (the dollar) on a depreciation path," said TomLevinson, currency strategist at ING in a note to clients. "An absence of BOJ asset purchases of a similar scaletogether with USD/JPY's strong correlation with U.S. Treasuryyields will keep the former biased lower." Dollar/yen hovered close to this week's 15-year low of80.21, with the all-time low at 79.75 close by, as the marketstayed sensitive to potential for fresh Japanese intervention tostem the yen's rise.       The dollar remained weak, but showed some signs ofsteadying after a fall on Tuesday. A widely expected outcome of U.S. midterm elections, wherethe Republicans took control of the House of Representativeswhile the Democrats were set to hang on to the Senate, alsooffered some support. The Australian dollar was at $0.9985, retreating from a28-year high above parity after weak building sector data tooksome of the shine off the currency, which rallied on Tuesdaywhen the Australian central bank raised interest rates.
