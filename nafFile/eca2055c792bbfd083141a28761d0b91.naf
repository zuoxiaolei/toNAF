<raw><![CDATA[ * U.S. to assure Gulf countries on U.S. economy * Gulf Arab states major holder of dollar-dominated assets  By Ulf Laessing and Glenn Somerville RIYADH/LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Treasury SecretaryTimothy Geithner will seek to reassure Gulf Arab states thisweek that U.S. dollar assets they hold in large quantitiesremain a strong investment. A recent decline in Saudi foreign assets shows the purchaseof U.S. treasuries by Washington's Gulf allies, five havingcurrencies pegged to the dollar, at levels seen in the pastdecades should no longer be taken for granted. Geithner, offering assurances on the United States' abilityto pull out of recession, is combining a visit to Saudi Arabiaand the United Arab Emirates, the Arab world's largest andsecond-largest economies, with a trip to Europe. He is unlikely to encounter any challenge to the dollar'sglobal dominance on his visit to the world's biggest oilexporting region, analysts and diplomats said. China and Russia have expressed concerns about the weakenedU.S. currency staying as the only dominant reserve currency. ButBeijing, which itself holds large quantities of U.S. assets,suggests any change would be a long-term affair. "The U.S. is looking to reassure Saudi Arabia and the GCC(Gulf Cooperation Council) countries on the outlook of thedollar and U.S. investments given the challenges for the U.S.economy and fiscal position," said Monica Malik, a regionaleconomist at EFG-Hermes in Dubai. Riyadh-based analyst John Sfakianakis added the trip was "animportant customer visit to one of the biggest holders of U.S.government paper and a seminal dollar supporter". U.S. officials played down expectations that Geithner wouldpursue any major initiatives, but indicated that one of the aimswas to ensure foreign investors would not lose faith in theUnited States as a primary target for their investments. "We will want to reiterate that we're open to foreigninvestment from the region," a U.S. official said.Malik said realignments in world trade had already made theirmark on GCC reserves. "There is already likely to have been a diversification ofGCC reserves in terms of currencies over the last few yearsgiven the dollar weakness and the expanding trade with Asia andEurope," said Malik. Saudi net foreign assets have fallen by around 183 billionriyals ($48.80 billion) since November, according to centralbank data, as the world's biggest oil exporter dips intoreserves built up over decades thanks to high crude prices. Central Bank Governor Mohammad al-Jasser said in May thekingdom was not selling any foreign assets but was drawing on reserves to continue spending to keep the economy going. Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf told Reuters in May theG20 member kept diverse foreign exchange reserves, broadlyreflecting trends in the kingdom's trade and needs.  TRADE COMPETITION Geithner will address Saudi business leaders on Tuesday inJeddah before holding talks in the UAE on Wednesday. The United States is still the main trading partner forSaudi Arabia but Asian or European countries are making inroads. A consortium including China Railway Construction Corp<0390.HK> <601390.SS> won a Saudi infrastructure deal worth $1.8billion, while European aerospace group (EADS)  just wonits second defence contract in the kingdom, beating U.S. firms. Another purpose of Geithner's visit was to to make sureregional investors were not still put off by the politicalcontroversy that followed Dubai's DP World's acquisition in 2006 of a British firm that would have given itcontrol over some U.S. ports. Some U.S. lawmakers objected on national security groundsand state-owned DP World eventually transferred the operation ofthe terminals to an American entity. "We have a new process post-DPW and we want to make sure theprocess is fair and transparent and predictable, that it focusesappropriately on real national security concerns," the U.S.official said.
