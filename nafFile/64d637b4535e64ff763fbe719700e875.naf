<raw><![CDATA[ FRANKFURT, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank issticking to its goal of fighting a rise in the franc against theeuro as it mulls the right moment to start withdrawingextraordinary support for the economy, Chairman Jean-Pierre Rothsaid late on Monday. Roth told the International Club of Frankfurt BusinessJournalists that prospects for the Swiss economy had improved,although the risk of deflation could come back if the financialcrisis were to intensify again. The SNB has fought the financial and economic crisis bycutting interest rates to historically low levels, buying bondsand intervening in markets to stop the franc rising -- astrategy Roth said had not changed. "We will decisively prevent a rise ... in the franc againstthe euro," he said in comments approved for release onTuesday."Our strategy from March has not changed, we stick tothis strategy." The franc was trading at around 1.5075 against the euro onTuesday, close to the level where analysts and traders say theSNB could intervene, and was also close to parity against theU.S. dollar.  Some traders said the SNB intervened to stop a rise in thefranc against the dollar after it hit a 19-month high lastThursday. Asked if the SNB was also concerned about the dollarexchange rate, Roth noted that the euro zone accounted for 60percent of Swiss trade and therefore the euro-franc rate was of"great importance" to the SNB. He joined international colleagues in urging China to letits currency move more freely, after summit talks with theEuropean Union failed to bring a change in tone. "The relationship between the renminbi and the dollar iscause for concern. Why is U.S. monetary policy the best policyfor China?" the SNB chief said. "China should be independent with its own independentcurrency and its own independent prices and not (have) a fixedexchange rate."  OUTLOOK BRIGHTER The SNB is expected to keep monetary policy loose at itsnext meeting on Dec. 10, targeting a three-month Libor rate of0.25 percent, and will also release updated economic forecastsfor growth and inflation. Data earlier on Tuesday showed the Swiss economy pulled outof recession in the third quarter with growth of 0.3 percent inthe three-month period, and manufacturing activity rose to a20-month high in November. Roth said the Swiss economy had proved more resilient thanexpected earlier in the year, but risks still remained.  "We expect measured growth," he said on the 2010 growthoutlook. "We expect growth next year, so no more recession, butof course not strong growth."The outlook for prices had also improved, as the SNB said inSeptember, but the risk of deflation had not entirely gone. "If the crisis were to be not fully over, we could come backinto this situation (of deflation risk) relatively quickly,"Roth said. Banks would have to reckon with worsening credit portfoliosand further writedowns, he said. Germany's Bundesbank estimatedlast week the country's banks faced up to 90 billion euros inwritedowns by the end of 2010. SNB policymakers have said the central bank will have tocorrect policy settings as the economy improves, but Roth gaveno hint on when this might come. All central banks were thinking about when and how tocorrect their extraordinary measures to support growth, and eachhad to take the decision based on local conditions. "But when, the day and hour, that is like in the Bible," hesaid. "We don't know the day or the hour ... and advance noticeis out of place. Central banks have a price stability goal andwe know that with rates close to zero, one cannot have pricestability in the long term. All central banks know that."
