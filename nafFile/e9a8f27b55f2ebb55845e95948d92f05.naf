<raw><![CDATA[ * Talks involve tricky beef and auto trade issues * South Korea is America's seventh-largest trading partner (Updates with talks continuing) By Doug Palmer COLUMBIA, Maryland, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The United States andSouth Korea were continuing high-stakes talks into the night onThursday in the hopes of resolving auto and beef issues thathave blocked approval of a free trade pact for three years. Carol Guthrie, a spokeswoman for the U.S. TradeRepresentative's office, would not comment on the possibilitythe talks would be extended into a fourth day on Friday. Norwould she say whether a deal was imminent. South Korean Trade Minister Kim Jong-hoon told reportersbefore heading into an afternoon session that the two sideswere still "far away" from an agreement. U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk seemed to offer a moreupbeat assessment, telling reporters "things are good" whenasked how the talks are going. He did not elaborate. Although Kim has said both sides are committed to getting adeal this week, U.S. officials have said their main goal is tomake progress on the outstanding issues. Negotiators failed to meet a self-imposed deadline lastmonth to solve the problems. South Korea is the United States' seventh-largest tradingpartner and eighth-largest export market. Last year, the UnitedStates exported $28.6 billion worth of goods to South Korea andimported $39.2 billion of products from that country. The two countries signed a free trade agreement on June 30,2007, but it has been stuck in the U.S. Congress because ofopposition from the U.S. auto industry. South Korean barriersto U.S. beef have also delayed action. The United States is asking South Korea to renegotiate theauto terms of the agreement, something that is politicallydifficult for Seoul to do without getting concessions of equalweight from Washington in return. The United States exported 7,663 cars and light trucks toSouth Korea in 2009 while it imported 476,857 from automakersthere, according to U.S. Commerce Department figures. Ford Motor Co and its supporters in Congress complain thelopsided trade is due to South Korean tax and regulatorybarriers the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) fails toadequately address. "STRONGEST MARKET-OPENING PROVISIONS" Karan Bhatia, a former deputy U.S. trade representative,defended the agreement he helped negotiate while serving in theadministration of George W. Bush. "This is probably the strongest FTA (free trade agreement)with the strongest market-opening provisions that have everexisted in an FTA. That's true with respect to services. That'strue with respect to agriculture and that's true also withrespect to manufacturing," Bhatia said. "The notion that we might not get that benefit because weare trying to satisfy one auto company -- I just think thatwould be tragic." Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus also wantsSeoul to commit to a process for fully reopening its market toU.S. beef exports, another politically difficult demand becauseof strong South Korean public opposition. U.S. beef exporters have already recovered much of theirlost market share in South Korea under a voluntary industryagreement to address lingering concerns about several cases ofmad cow disease found in the U.S. cattle herd as far back asDecember 2003. Much of the beef industry is eager to have the pactapproved because it phases out a 40-percent South Korean tariffon U.S. beef and because a major competitor, Australia, isnegotiating its own free trade pact with South Korea. U.S. officials have declined to say if the United States iswilling to make concessions on its side to compensate SouthKorea for changing the terms of the deal the two countriessigned in 2007 after a year of negotiation. The deal would be the second-largest U.S. free tradeagreement after the North American Free Trade Agreement withCanada and Mexico. Supporters also see it as linchpin of U.S.economic engagement in the fast-growing Asian region. (Reporting by Doug Palmer; Editing by Philip Barbara)             ]]></raw>
