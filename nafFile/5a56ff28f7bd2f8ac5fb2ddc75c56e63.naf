<raw><![CDATA[  * Wall Street opens higher on bargain-hunting * Greek CDS at record high; euro at record low vs Swiss * China data, U.S. growth concerns prompt risk unwinding * U.S. oil prices fall, gold near 10-day lows (Updates to U.S. markets;, changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Richard Leong NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks rose onMonday after cheaper prices after six-weeks of losses enticedbargain-hunting investors back into the market, even as theeuro fell on nagging worries over Europe's attempts to solvethe Greek debt crisis. Weaker Chinese data fueled concerns about slowing globalgrowth, briefly knocking non-U.S. shares to a 12-week low. Reduced risk appetite led to an unwinding of positions inoil and precious metals. "The market has been oversold over the last six weeks, so ashort-term rebound on short-covering is not out of thequestion," said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Stifel,Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New Jersey. The S&P 500 index  and other benchmarks opened higheron Monday. The S&P 500 sagged nearly 7 percent on the back of abarrage of soft economic data after closing on April 29 at itshighest closing level in nearly three years. [US/] The gains in U.S. and European stocks  helped theMSCI world equity index  to rise 0.2 percentafter hitting its weakest since mid-March. The world stock benchmark has lost nearly 8 percent sincehitting a three-year peak in late April and is very close toerasing all of its 2011 gains. In Asia, Chinese stocks ended at a 4-1/2 month low, hit byworries about the impact of monetary policy tightening in aneconomy which is a key driver of world growth. China's money growth slowed to a 30-month low in May andbanks extended fewer new loans than expected, while exports tothe United States and EU hit their weakest since late 2009. An increasingly gloomy economic backdrop and Greece'sfiscal predicament have stacked the odds against risk-taking. Investors are concerned by signs policymakers arestruggling to reach an agreement on a second bailout for Athensand that any steps taken to involve private investors will windup triggering a technical debt default. The cost of insuring Greek sovereign debt against defaultrose to an all-time high, while the euro hit a record lowagainst the safe-haven Swiss franc. Uncertainty over future U.S. monetary policy after theFederal Reserve's $600-billion bond purchase program ends thismonth also added to investor aversion to taking on riskierassets, especially going into the thinly-traded summer months. "Equities look like a buy at these sorts of levels on a oneto two year view, but I would not read too much into it," saidDavid Coombs, fund manager at Rathbone Brothers, which has 15.2billion pounds under management. GREEK DEAL European leaders are due to complete a new rescue packagefor Greece at a Brussels summit on June 23-24, but deepdivisions remain about how to get the private sector involved,while the deal would not help reduce Greece's massive 340billion euro debt load. Five-year credit default swaps on Greek sovereign debt rose58 basis points on the day to a record high of 1,600 bps,according to data monitor Markit. "What the euro needs is a resolution to the Greek crisisand the politicians and the central bankers do not appear to beclose to finding one," said Kit Juckes, currency strategist atSociete Generale in London. "That uncertainty is weighing onthe euro." The euro fell against the Swiss franc, but gained versusthe U.S. dollar on expectations that euro zone interest rateswould remain higher than those in the United States. The euro touched a record low of 1.2004 Swiss francs on theEBS trading platform . The Swiss franc is seen as aglobal barometer for risk aversion. The euro  was up around 0.2 percent at $1.4375 aftercentral bank buying erased earlier losses. In the oil market, U.S. crude oil  fell 0.76 percentto $98.53 a barrel on a report of more supply from SaudiArabia. The world's biggest oil exporter will raise output to10 million barrels per day in July, Saudi newspaper al-Hayatreported on Friday, as Riyadh goes it alone in pumping moreoutside official OPEC policy. In gold trading, bullion prices fell to its lowest in about10 days as the euro eased against the dollar. Spot gold was down 0.3 percent at $1,527.11 an ounce, above a session lowof $1,523.44.
