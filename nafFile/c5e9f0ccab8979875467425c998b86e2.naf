Bank shares were battered in Europe as investors feared theimpact of a Greek default on holders of the country's bonds,such as Franco Belgian financial group Dexia , whosestock slumped nearly 10 percent. Demand for safe-havens such as U.S. government bonds andthe Japanese yen was on the rise. Treasuries prices were alsosupported by the Federal Reserve's first bond purchase forOperation Twist, its latest bond program aimed at helping theU.S. economy. The 2012 draft budget approved by Greece's cabinet onSunday predicted a deficit of 8.5 percent of gross domesticproduct for 2011, well over the 7.6 percent target. "There continues to be very little clarity with respect toa solution (in Europe). More time is needed, and there's noreal driving influence to put money back in the market," saidJoseph Cangemi, managing director at BNY ConvergEx Group in NewYork. European policymakers appeared no nearer to agreeing on adefinitive solution to the crisis. Officials meeting on Mondaywere discussing ways to leverage the bloc's rescue fund andpressure Greece to implement agreed structural reforms. Fordetails, see [ID:nL5E7L20LD].
