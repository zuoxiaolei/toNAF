<raw><![CDATA[ (Corrects ranking of French arms export markets to show Moroccosecond and Saudi Arabia third)  * Shift away from heavy reliance on Middle East * Brazil tops list of French arms export markets * Report coincides with new U.S. air tanker contest  (Recasts, adds details) By Tim Hepher PARIS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Deals with Brazil, Saudi Arabiaand Morocco pushed French arms sales up 13 percent last year totheir highest level since 2000, the government said on Monday. The increase follows a drive under President Nicolas Sarkozyto support defence export companies that, according to thegovernment, directly or indirectly provide 50,000 jobs inFrance. French companies took new orders worth 6.6 billion euros($9.7 billion), strengthening France's grip on fourth place inthe league table of global arms exporters behind the UnitedStates, Britain and Russia, the defence ministry said. France has about 7 percent of the global arms market, whichis shifting away from a heavy reliance on the Middle East. Sarkozy this month led an arms export delegation to Brazil,which finalised a deal to buy four conventional submarines andis pondering whether to buy French Rafale warplanes, built byDassault Aviation. "We are getting away from the classic idea that France onlyexports to the Middle East and we are doing what is necessary torespond to the needs of Europe, Asia and Latin America," defenceministry spokesman Laurent Teisseire told a news briefing. Brazil and France signed a defence accord in December lastyear worth up to 8.6 billion euros, including the supply of 50EC725 Super Cougar helicopters built by EADS subsidiaryEurocopter. France had seen its defence exports come under pressure formost of the decade as it struggled to repeat the success ofDassault's previous generation of Mirage warplanes with themulti-role Rafale, which has not yet found a buyer. France sold weapon systems worth 8.2 billion euros in 2000. Morocco was France's second-largest client in 2008 with acontract to buy FREMM frigates built by a state-controlledcompany 25-percent owned by electronics firm Thales. France suffered an embarrassing setback at the end of theprevious year when Morocco snubbed a French offer of Rafales infavour of Lockheed Martin F-16 fighters, prompting Sarkozy toorder a shake-up of France's arms export system. In third place last year was Saudi Arabia, thanks in part toa deal to buy air refuelling tankers converted from passengerplanes built by EADS subsidiary Airbus. Details were presented to the French parliament as EADS andU.S. partner Northrop Grumman embarked on a fierce battle withU.S. contractor Boeing to secure a far bigger order of mid-airtankers for the U.S. Air Force. Washington published draft bidding rules on Friday for acontest now said by a senior U.S. military official to bepotentially worth as much as $50 billion.  Shipments of arms sold in previous years fell in 2008 to3.17 billion euros from 4.6 billion in 2007, but the figures arenot final because of bureaucratic delays in compiling data. "The orders we are seeing now will lead to an increase indeliveries in future years," Teisseire said. ($1 = 0.6810 euro)(Editing by David Holmes and Simon Jessop)             ]]></raw>
