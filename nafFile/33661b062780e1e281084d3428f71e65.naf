<raw><![CDATA[ * Asia stocks drop 1 pct, hold up after Wall St slide * More profit-taking in risky assets expected beforeyear-end * Aussie and higher-yielding FX bounce back from early drop * VIX spike spooks, but Nikkei implied vol rise limited By Eric Burroughs HONG KONG, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Asian stocks slipped to aone-month low on Monday after a sell-off in banking sharesslammed Wall Street, a slide viewed as a sign that investorsare losing faith in the economic recovery. European shares were set to edge higher at the start, withfutures on the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 inching up 0.1 percent. Worries about the U.S. financial sector resurfaced afterCIT Group Inc, the lender to small and mid-sized U.S.companies, filed for bankruptcy and an accounting expert saidCitigroup may need further write-downs. But the fallout on Asian equity markets was limited andhigher-yielding currencies quickly recovered from early losses,with some market players blaming the volatile moves onprofit-taking and portfolio reshuffling before year-end. Chinese manufacturing activity accelerated to an 18-monthhigh in October, underscoring that Asia's engine of growth ispowering ahead even as demand from the United States and othermajor economies remains weak. The dollar dipped while oil prices edged higher to bounceback from a sharp drop on Friday along with shares. U.S. crudeoil was up 35 cents a barrel to $77.35. Hedge funds and other players were cited as sellers ofemerging market stocks and currencies last week, looking totake profits on their best trades before many funds close theirbooks for the year in November. "We have seen modest redemptions out of our pool of fundsand that is mainly because of a brief round of profit takingand risk reduction by clients who allocated early this year,"said Adam Matthews, head of the Asian client portfoliomanagement team at JP Morgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. "Judging from the money parked on the sidelines by pensionfunds, insurers and private banks its difficult to believe themarket can fall more than 10-20 percent in the short term. Inthe long term we don't expect the yo-yo like volatility in theregion's markets to continue as institutional allocation ishere to stay," said Matthews, who manages funds worth $58billion. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1percent, touching a one-month low but still up nearly 60percent this year. The Thomson Reuters index of regional stocksshed 1.5 percent. Investors sold $530 million in shares in Asia ex-Japan lastweek but have snapped up $50.6 billion so far this year, withSouth Korean and India taking in the biggest amount of funds. Japan's Nikkei average dropped 2.3 percent, mirroring the2.8 percent slide in the U.S. S&P 500 on Friday -- its biggestone-day drop since July. But futures on the S&P edged up inAsia, providing some relief that the selling pressure would notextend into the new month. VOLATILIY IS BACK A spike in the VIX volatility index on the S&P, known asWall Street's fear gauge, also stirred worries that investorswere starting to brace for a deeper drop in stocks. But the move in the equity options market was not mirroredin Asia. Implied volatility, a gauge of option marketexpectations of future moves, on Nikkei futures edged up onlyslightly. The slide in U.S. shares came despite an array of positivethird-quarter earnings. Thomson Reuters data shows that 80 percent of the 344companies in the S&P 500 that reported earnings so far havebeat expectations. Gains in higher-yielding currencies weighed on the dollar.Its gauge of its performance against six major currenciesdipped 0.2 percent to 76.250. The Australian dollar rose 0.7 percent to $0.9044, whilethe euro edged up 0.2 percent to $1.4745. Some of the early volatility in higher-yielding currencieswas due to a sharp fall in the South African rand tied toselling by a Japanese margin trader broker. Traders suspectedthat a mistaken trade may have sparked the sharp drop. Government bonds gained on the stock market woes. Thebenchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield dipped 3 basispoints to 1.375 percent, down from a 2-Â½   month high reachedlast week.
