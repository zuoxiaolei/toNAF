The yen climbed across the board and sterling hit a 13-yearlow against the Aussie dollar, while oil topped $71 a barrel. Many Asian investors are pinning their hopes on Chinaleading a regional recovery as Western economies continue tosputter, but Chinese data for July showed that although exportsrose from June, industrial output did not grow as much asexpected. "This data argues for some moderation in growth in Q3versus the big gains we saw in Q2. The recovery is still ontrack, at least at the headline level," said Ben Simpfendorfer,an RBS China economist in Hong Kong. Major European stock futures were up 0.3 percent while U.S.equity futures were down 0.01 percent. Shares in Hong Kong and Shanghai recovered early losses bylunchtime while Tokyo shares hit a 10-month closing high for afourth consecutive trading day.

The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady at 0.1percent, and said the economy had stopped worsening but wasstill in a difficult situation. South Korea's central bank also kept rates on hold, withGovernor Lee Seong-tae saying it was still unclear the economywas back on solid footing and warning that bond markets haveoverpriced the chances of a rate rise. Lee's comments sparked a rally in government debt, pushingfive-year treasury bond yields down 11 basis points to 4.88percent. The MSCI Index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan, whichhas rallied nearly 80 percent since a global rebound inequities began on March 9, was up 0.2 percent but blue chipswere mixed. EXPORTERS SLIDE The yen and the U.S. dollar rose in reaction to China'seconomic data, notably against the Aussie and the New Zealanddollar The market has begun to price in tightening by the FederalReserve as early as February, a shift encouraged by last week'sencouraging jobs report. That has helped lift the dollaralthough analysts are wary on the outlook. "Whether a paradigm shift is taking place with regards to aloosening in correlation between risk aversion and the U.S.dollar is still too early to call," said Jonathan Cavenagh, acurrency strategist at Westpac in Sydney. The greenback was at $1.4145 per euro against $1.4143 latein New York, and at 96.88 yen from 97.08. Sterling fell to a 13-year low against the Australiandollar at 50.9 UK pence in early Asian trade, after slumping inoverseas trade as investors fretted about the Bank of England'sshock expansion of quantitative easing last week and possibledeflationary pressures in the UK economy. The Aussie dollar is also benefiting from marketexpectations for a rate hike before the end of the year. Singapore's stock market was the best performer in theregion, gaining 2.2 percent by early afternoon and catching upafter a public holiday. The government sprung a surprise byupgrading its final second-quarter GDP growth but it warnedthat economic recovery would be neither "quick nor strong" Shares in Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto extendedMonday's losses after China stepped up spying allegationsagainst the firm.
