<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar hit session highs against the euro and the yen on Wednesday, as stronger-than-forecast U.S. retail sales figures for February fuelled optimism over the strengthening U.S. economic recovery.During U.S. morning trade, the dollar hit session highs against the euro, with EUR/USD dropping 0.73% to 1.2937.The Commerce Department said U.S. retail sales rose 1.1% in February, beating expectations for a 0.5% increase. Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, rose more-than-expected, climbing 1.0% compared to expectations for a 0.2% gain.
