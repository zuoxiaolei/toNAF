<raw><![CDATA[ * China aims to expand yuan trade settlement plan nationwide * C.bank says to broaden channels for yuan to flow back * China to support foreign c.banks to buy yuan for reserves (Adds PBoC quotes, further details)  By Zhou Xin and Koh Gui Qing BEIJING, March 2 (Reuters) - China wants to allow importersand exporters across the nation to settle trades in the yuanthis year, the central bank said on Wednesday, a move that wouldgrow the currency's role in international financial markets. The plans, published by the People's Bank of China after ameeting about the yuan's role in cross-border deals, underlinedBeijing's ambitions to turn the presently tightly-controlledyuan into a convertible and dominant currency in coming years. "The market's demand for cross-border use of the yuan isrising, and cross-border yuan business is expected to growstrongly," the central bank said in a statement. Besides relaxing its hold over the yuan in cross-bordertrade deals, the central bank said it would also: -- increase the number of channels through which the yuancan flow back into China. That would be done in part by allowingmore foreign banks to buy bonds in China's inter-bank market. -- Respond "actively" to any demands from foreign centralbanks to use the yuan as a reserve currency; -- seek bilateral currency swap deals to encourage the useof the yuan in bilateral trade and investment; -- trial a programme for overseas investment using the yuan; -- study the possibility of allowing foreign directinvestment in China using the yuan; -- give China's monetary policy committee, an advisory body,a bigger role in policy making; -- study and research possible impacts from yuan flows onmonetary policy, interest rates and exchange rates. China first experimented with plans to relax its controlover the yuan last year by allowing importers and exporters in20 provinces to conduct their businesses in the yuan. The trial, which now covers 67,000 companies, has proven tobe a success. The total value of trade settled in the yuanrocketed to 506.3 billion yuan ($77.06 billion) in 2010. As a by-product of Beijing easing its control over the yuan,the offshore yuan business in Hong Kong has exploded as well,with foreign banks eager to get a foothold in the rapidlygrowing yuan deposit and bond issuance businesses. As of December, only five foreign banks including HSBC  and Standard Chartered are allowed to trade in the Chinesebond market within a quota of 29.2 billion yuan the central banksaid. China has inked eight bilateral currency deals, worth atotal of 803.5 billion yuan, since the end of 2008 in a move togive the yuan a bigger international role.
