<raw><![CDATA[* MSCI world equity index down 1.9 pct at 265.76 * Sharp falls in China, Japan spill over to Europe * Oil tumbles; dollar, government bonds firmer  By Natsuko Waki LONDON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - World stocks fell by nearly 2percent on Monday, led by sharp drops in Asia, while governmentbonds and the dollar rose as doubts about the strength of aglobal economic recovery triggered a risk asset sell-off. The benchmark MSCI world equity index  headedfor its biggest one-day loss since early July. Chinese stocks hit a two-month low and posted their biggest daily dropin 9 months, having rallied more than 85 percent since January. Friday's data showing a further deterioration in U.S.consumer confidence overwhelmed a report on Monday that Japanbecame the third G7 country after Germany and France to pull outof recession. "There is now a realisation that coming out of a recessionis one thing, but building a recovery is another," said JustinUrquhart Stewart, director at Seven Investment Management. "We are now down to how companies are going to grow. Thegrowth we have seen out of Japan as well as Europe looks like ithas been primarily based on government stimulation ... Thequestion is, is this sustainable?"MSCI world equity index  was down 1.9percent, having hit a 10-month high on Friday. The FTSEurofirst300 index  lost 2 percent. U.S. stock futures  were down more than 2 percent,pointing to a weaker open on Wall Street later. Friday's datafrom the Reuters/University of Michigan surveys showed consumerconfidence fell more than expected in early August, hitting itslowest level since March. "We seem to have been a bit spooked with the U.S. consumerconfidence figures and that has followed through into the FarEast," said David Morrison, market strategist at GFT Global. "It all just feels like we're running out of steam. We'vehad a great summer so far... It might be the start of arealisation that we have really overcooked this." Emerging stocks  fell 3.2 percent.   CHINA FEARS Shanghai stocks  fell 5.8 percent to their lowestclose in two months on worries about added share supplies andcommodity price declines. The index is down more than 17 percentfrom its 14-month high hit a fortnight ago. According to Thomson Reuters data, the price to earningsratio -- a valuations measure -- on Shanghai stocks has nearlydoubled to 28 times since the start of the year following therally. This compares with the P/E ratio of 15.7 times on the S&P500 index . U.S. crude oil  fell 2.5 percent to a two-week low of$65.80 a barrel. The September Bund futures  rose 30 ticks to atwo-week high. In Britain, the yield on two-year gilts hit a newall-time low of 0.852 percent  as prices surged. The dollar  rose 0.7 percent against a basket of majorcurrencies while the yen was 0.15 percent firmer at 94.64 perdollar. "A creeping rise in risk aversion could provide the dollar with a temporary boost," Citi said in a note to clients. "A more decisive market correction could be triggered by aresumption of flows into the market and/or evidence that Chinalacks control over its overheating economy and its frothyfinancial markets. We expect the yen to remain well bid in thiscontext." (Additional reporting by Joanne Frearson and Harpreet Bhal;editing by Stephen Nisbet)             ]]></raw>
