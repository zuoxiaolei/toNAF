<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar falls; near 15-near year low versus yen * Investors debate possibility of intervention by Japan * US jobless rise; Philly Fed lowest in a year (Adds comment, updates prices, adds byline) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar on Thursdaydropped near a 15-year low versus the yen but rose against theeuro after weak U.S. economic data and steep losses in thestock market ignited a return to risk aversion. Mid-Atlantic factory activity contracted in August for thefirst time in more than a year and new U.S. jobless claimsscaled a nine-month high last week, delivering another blow tothe fragile U.S. economic recovery. Investors flocked to safe havens such as the U.S. dollar,yen and Swiss franc. The yen also gained versus the greenbackas U.S. bond yields fell on worries about the economy, thoughinvestors were reluctant to chase it higher amid fears Japaneseauthorities may take steps to rein in its strength. "If you look at the Swiss franc and if you look at what theequity markets are doing, the euro's weakness would beconsistent with higher risk aversion," said VassiliSerebriakov, currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. "But we would suspect that the markets are wary of pushingthe yen too high at this juncture, given the possibleescalation in rhetoric from Japanese officials," he added. In afternoon trading, the euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.2814,after touching a session trough of $1.2773, according toReuters data. Support comes in at the 100-day moving averagearound $1.2776. The dollar was down 0.2 percent at 85.27 yen. It hit asession low of 84.89 on electronic trading platform EBS, withinstriking distance of a 15-year low of 84.72 hit on EBS lastweek. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its businessactivity index fell to minus 7.7, confounding markets that hadexpected a rise to 7.0. "The Philly Fed number is shockingly bad, resulting in theU.S. 2-year making new lows in yield," said Douglas Borthwick,managing director at Faros Trading LLC in Stamford Connecticut."With yields at these lows the dollar is quickly becoming thefunding currency of choice." Though not inherently bad for the dollar, being a fundingcurrency weakens the unit as investors borrow it, thenimmediately sell it. Carry trade involves borrowing in a lowyielding currency to buy higher yielding assets elsewhere. DOLLAR GAINS CAPPED The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, which measures thegreenback versus a basket of currencies, rose 0.3 percent to82.467. Gains in the dollar were limited, HOWEVER, as a recentstring of weak U.S. data fueled worries about the possibilityof a double-dip recession and sparked talk of additional easingmeasures from the Fed to boost the economy. "People are still questioning whether to sell the dollar onweak U.S. data or buy it on a general move away from risk,"said Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown BrothersHarriman in New York. Wells Fargo's Serebriakov expects to see some dollardeclines in the short term if weak U.S. data continues to bereported, but he added this may be somewhat offset shouldglobal stocks react negatively and boost safe-haven demand. "As long as the U.S. economic soft patch persists and aslong as the global recovery broadly continues, we should see asomewhat weaker dollar in the months ahead." The Swiss franc rose broadly. The dollar hit a seven-monthlow versus the franc and was last down 0.9 percent at 1.0322.The euro lost 1.3 percent to 1.3231. Investors were watching to see if the Bank of Japan willtake more monetary easing steps -- such as expanding liquidity-- ahead of a meeting between Prime Minister Naoto Kan and BOJGovernor Masaaki Shirakawa expected on Monday. The yen earlier slipped as rumors circulated that thecentral bank would hold an emergency policy meeting. Althoughsources later said this was unlikely.
