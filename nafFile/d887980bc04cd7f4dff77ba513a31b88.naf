<raw><![CDATA[   * Q1 sales 978 million stg, up 5 pct vs company poll 951 mln * 2011 sales to grow faster than market, margins to improve * Shares up 3.6 percent in London   (Adds CEO comment, analyst reaction, updates shares)  By Paul Sandle and Georgina Prodhan  LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - IT services company Logica Plc  beat quarterly sales growth forecasts due to strongerprivate-sector demand for outsourcing and said its Britishoperation should return to growth in the second half. The Anglo-Dutch company, hit by public spending cuts inEurope, said on Wednesday it continued to expect growth abovethe market rate and a modest margin improvement this year, afterfirst-quarter orders rose 29 percent. Chief Executive Andy Green told reporters he expected tomarket to grow by "low single digits" this year, driven bycontinued demand for outsourcing and low-level growth inconsulting. "There are clear of economic recovery across many of ourmarkets and we believe we are well placed to benefit from that,"he said. Customers have been reluctant to embark on major IT upgradesduring the downturn, putting pressure on Logica's consulting andsystems integration unit, although the company has benefitedfrom demand for outsourcing as firms cut costs. Industry research group Gartner said on Wednesday thatworldwide IT services revenue returned to growth in 2010 afterthe global recession in 2008 and 2009, with spending up 3percent to $793 billion. Logica's first-quarter sales grew 5 percent to 978 millionpounds ($1.6 billion), above a forecast for 951 million in acompany poll and boosted by 13 percent growth in outsourcing. Logica shares rose 3.6 percent in London and 3.3 percent inAmsterdam by 0921 GMT against a 0.3 percent weaker Europeantechnology sector.  NEW HIRES Panmure Gordon analyst George O'Connor said the firstquarter update indicated that Logica was trading in line withfull-year expectations. O'Connor said revenue and order book were both ahead of hisexpectations, but he noted that in the early stages of recoveryIT service companies have a tendency to miss margin guidance asoverall staff utilisation weakened due to additional hires. Green said Logica was recruiting in offshore locations likeIndia as well as in the UK and France.  "First-half profitability will be affected by costs toensure we have the right skills base in place to meet marketdemand" Green said.  Logica's rival Accenture reported an increase of 9 percentin dollars and 14 percent in local currency in Europe for itsfiscal second quarter to end-February.  Logica said a 30 million pound restructuring it wasundertaking would deliver around 15 million benefit startingfrom the end of the second quarter and contributing to theexpected 2011 margin improvement. In Britain, where the government has been imposing deepspending cuts, Logica reported a 4 percent fall in revenue withpublic-sector revenue down 9 percent, but orders from othercustomers, including oil company Shell, rose threefold. France, Logica's biggest market and which accounts for about23 percent of revenue, increased sales by 11 percent and Logicamade 400 new hires to support growth. Units in northern andcentral Europe, Sweden and outside Europe also grew. Benelux sales fell 5 percent because of public-spendingcuts, and Logica used only about 75 percent of its capacitythere. The company said it was seeking to move more employees inBenelux onto commercial-sector work. (Editing by Dan Lalor and Andrew Callus) ($1 = 0.6072 pound)             ]]></raw>
