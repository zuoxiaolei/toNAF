<raw><![CDATA[ BEIJING, March 22 (Reuters) - Four employees of mininggiant Rio Tinto, including Australian national Stern Hu, facedtrial in China on Monday, charged with receiving bribes andinfringing commercial secrets. Here is an explanation of the case and its implications. WHAT ARE THE FOUR ACCUSED OF? Australian Stern Hu and three Chinese executives of theAnglo-Australian miner, which does much business with China,were formally arrested in July. The three Chinese are LiuCaikui, Ge Minqiang and Wang Yong. They were arrested on suspicion of illegally obtainingcommercial secrets and bribery. Initial Chinese media reportsthat they faced accusations of stealing state secrets did notmaterialise. Under the commercial secrets charge, courts can jail peoplefor up to three years, or up to seven years in "especiallyserious" cases. The bribery charge could draw jail terms of up to 20 years,according to Zhang Peihong, a lawyer for one of the accusedChinese nationals, Wang Yong. Rio has said the four did nothing wrong. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? The trial has opened in Shanghai, China's coastal financialcentre, where the four employees were based. It is scheduled tolast three days. In Chinese trials there is sometimes a wait ofdays or weeks before a verdict is announced at a separatehearing. China's courts come under the heavy influence of the rulingCommunist Party and rarely reject prosecution arguments. Butthe Australian government and Rio, and the defendants'families, will be watching the trial carefully. Australian consular officials will be allowed to observethe part of the trial dealing with the bribery charges, butthey will be excluded from the part about infringing commercialsecrets, the Australian government said. Chinese trials are seldom open to foreign reporters, andthe Shanghai court has not granted them access this time. If convicted, the four men can appeal. Chinese investigators may also take up additional casesagainst steel executives accused of bribery and providingbusiness secrets in the Rio case. At least two executives at Chinese steel companies wereearlier detained in connection with the Rio case, but it isunclear whether they have also been formally charged. WHAT DOES THE CASE MEAN FOR THE STEEL INDUSTRY? Rio's China team managed details of term contracts for ironore, a necessary raw material for China's vast steel industry,as well as tracking market information. The Rio trial will add an element of uncertainty andwariness to already contentious iron ore negotiations betweenChina and the three big miners: Rio, its fellow Australianminer BHP Billiton and Brazil's Vale. Last year China's crude steel output accounted for almosthalf the world's total. Steel output and iron ore imports bothsoared to record highs in 2009. China and Rio had hard feelings even before the arrests,following the collapse of a deal by Chinese state-ownedaluminium firm Chinalco to increase its stake in Rio. Traditionally, Asian steel mills accept whatever deal issettled first between any mill and any of the big three globalore suppliers. China's steel industry association refused tosettle on that price last year and sought to change the basisof talks for 2010 prices, which take effect April 1. This year, the Chinese side has been led by Baosteel, whichjoined the Chinese steel industry association and other majorChinese steel mills in a plea to the government to step intothe talks. WHAT ARE THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS OF THE CASE? The detention of the four has stoked investors' worriesabout doing business in China's murky legal environment. The trial comes as Google's dispute with China overInternet censorship and hacking complaints has also broughtinto focus foreign business complaints about the country'sways. Google has indicated it expects a conclusion soon in itsdispute. HOW WILL THIS IMPACT CHINA-AUSTRALIA RELATIONS? Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd earlier warned Chinait had major economic interests at stake and the world waswatching how it handled the case. Both governments appear to want to insulate broader tiesfrom any contention over the case, especially after the statesecrets spying accusation was dropped. But China's decision to deny Australian officials access topart of the trial could stoke tensions, putting domesticpolitical pressure on Rudd. Much is at stake for both sides. China is Australia'sbiggest trade partner. Australia exported $15 billion worth ofiron ore to China in 2008 -- 41 percent of its iron ore importsin that period. Despite the arrest of the executives, Australian firms,including Rio, continue doing business and deals with China.(Editing by Ken Wills and Sanjeev Miglani)             ]]></raw>
