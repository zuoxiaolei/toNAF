<raw><![CDATA[ By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Signals from the currencyoptions market are exposing concerns about the outlook for theSwedish crown, one of the latest symbols of risk appetite,moving in lock step with the rise in global equities. The Swedish crown's implied volatility, or "vol," a measureof how much investors expect a currency to move in eitherdirection over a specific period and seen as a barometer ofrisk, has stayed elevated this year even as economies worldwidehave started to improve. Analysts said Sweden's prospects remain uncertain amid itsbanks huge exposure to the crisis-hit Baltics region,particularly Latvia, which may face more problems from itsbanks in the future. In contrast, options pricing reflects improved economicexpectations for Norway, Sweden's Scandinavian peer. Historically, Swedish vols tend to trade lower than thoseof the Norwegian currency, also called the crown. The Norwegiancrown's volatility traditionally tends to be higher because ittypically moves with commodity prices due to the country'sstanding as the world's fifth largest oil exporter. But Swedish vols are now outpacing Norway's, which havehave tracked the decline in the currency market's overallvolatility. Lower volatility has emboldened investors toventure into riskier currency bets given signs of an imminentrecovery around the world. "Swedish crown volatility stems from the Latviansituation," said Matthieu Zaradzki, FX options strategist, atBarclays Capital in Paris. "With Swedbank AB and SEB AB beingthe biggest banks in Latvia, there are concerns about defaultson loans in the region, which would cause large losses forSwedish banks." Latvia is reeling from Europe's harshest recession after alending-induced real estate boom collapsed, prompting thecountry to seek international aid to prevent bankruptcy. The Baltic economy pegs its lat currency to the euro aspart of its exchange-rate mechanism, but the financial crisisforced its government to implement austere measures to keep itseconomy competitive. HIGHER IMPLIED, HISTORICAL VOLATILITY One-month implied vols on the euro/Swedish crown pair were10.75 on Friday, Reuters data show, while similar vols for theeuro/Norwegian crown were 9.65. The Swedish currency over the past year has been sensitiveto swings in risk appetite, which analysts said was due tocurrency transactions of Swedish pensions funds related tohedging of international equity portfolios. As Swedish funds hedge their currency exposure, a declinein the value of their portfolios would cause the funds to sellthe crown, while a rise would prompt them to buy it. The Swedish crown's one-month historical volatility versusthe euro, which measures the currency's deviation from itsaverage, was also higher, at around 11.6 on Friday, comparedwith 10.00 for the Norway unit. That's higher than normal. This rise in volatility EUR/SEKreflects fear the Latvian government may de-peg the lat fromthe euro, weakening as a result and causing a significantdecline in Swedish bank assets. Three-month EUR/SEK vols, another key measure, were 10.10on Friday, compared to an average of 5 percent up until 2007. Aditya Bagaria, derivative strategist at Credit Suisse inNew York, said one-month EUR/SEK vols had traded "one vollower" than EUR/NOK from 2004 to mid-2008. In the spot market, the Swedish crown has gained 7.9percent against the euro so far this year, recovering abouthalf of its 14 percent losses in 2008. Barclays' Zaradzki believes the risk priced into theSwedish crown has been too high and believes EUR/SEK vols coulddecline as Latvia stabilizes. "In our view, the risk of a latdevaluation will lessen over time." NORWAY'S BULLISH OUTLOOK In contrast, most investment banks have adopted a bullishview on the Norwegian crown. Norway is expected to contract ata slower pace this year than most G10 economies. Calyon FX strategist Stuart Bennet, for instance, expectsNorway to "return swiftly to positive growth in 2010 at a rateexpected to be bested only by Canada." Morgan Stanley in a research note reckoned that the NorgesBank would be the first central bank to start tightening itsmonetary policy after the bank at its August meeting said itmay be appropriate to raise interest rates earlier thanexpected. Norway's crown has surged 13 percent so far in 2009 versusthe euro after plunging 18.6 percent last year. Much like theSwedish unit, the crown has become one of the proxies for riskgiven Norway's inks to oil as a major exporter. The crown typically benefits when the global economyexpands with higher oil demand. But unlike other commodity currencies, the Norwegian crownsuffers less from lower oil prices, analysts said. Norway'spetroleum fund plays a key role in hedging against crude falls,investing its large surplus in overseas markets. (Editing by Leslie Adler)             ]]></raw>
