<raw><![CDATA[ * Cbank cites growing inflation risks * Rate rise boosts dinar * Raiffeisen bank says more restrictive policy expected  (Corrects year in paragraph 8) By Ivana Sekularac BELGRADE, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Serbia's central bank surprisedmarkets by raising interest rates  by 50 basispoints to 8.50 percent on Thursday, citing a growing risk ofinflation at a time of dinar weakness. The move, the first interest rate decision under new centralbank governor Dejan Soskic, gave a small boost to the Serbiandinar, which hit a record low against the euro earlier this weekand has lost about 11 percent this year. "The executive board decided that the 0.5 percentage pointhike of the repo rate is necessary to reach targeted inflation,"the bank said in a statement. A Reuters poll published on Wednesday showed 12 out of 14currency dealers and bank analysts expecting an unchanged rateof 8 percent, with a rate hike more likely in September. After the interest rate hike, the Serbian dinar picked upand traded in 105.77-105.97 range to the euro, from the morninglevel of 105.94-106.14 range, a trader said. The Serbian unit of Raiffeisen International said after theannouncement that more bank moves could be forthcoming. "Once triggered, psychological inflationary pressures arehardly tackled via mild rational moves. Thus, in order to regainthe shattered trust, we expect even sharper moves," it said. The central bank estimated July consumer price inflation ataround 5 percent, up from 4.2 percent in June and 3.7 percent inMay. The bank targets 2010 inflation in the 4-8 percent range. In an interview published earlier on Thursday Soskic said aone percent depreciation in the dinar increases inflation by 0.3percentage point."In the future the bank will have to movetowards a more restrictive policy to maintain targetedinflation," Soskic told the weekly NIN. The bank had cut its benchmark interest rate by a total of9.75 percentage points in a cycle of easing stretching back toJanuary last year, with the last cut in May bringing it down to8 percent.  MOVE IN RIGHT DIRECTION Raising interest rates is clearly an effort to attract moreinvestors to dinar investments, such as bond investors lookingfor higher yields. Yet the unstable dinar has deterred many thisyear. Serbia's currency has fallen more than any other country inEurope in 2010, boosting exports but creating a risk thatgovernment borrowing costs will rise as investors grow waryabout dinar treasury bills. Sojan Stamenkovic, an economist and member of Serbian primeminister's economic council, said the central bank move wasaimed to boost the dinar. "I am not sure how successful it will be, we'll see, butit's a move in the right direction," he told Reuters. He said he was not confident the move would draw moreinvestors to invest in dinar treasury bills that are used tofinance the budget deficit. "The problem with our exchange rate is that we have anegative credit balance, when you exclude the IMF credits," hesaid.  Serbia's economy remains weak and the International MonetaryFund expects 2010 growth of just 1.5 percent, after a 3 percentcontraction in 2009. The impact from higher interest rates on Serbia's growth maybe less than in many countries as banks make the overwhelmingbulk of their loans in euros, not dinars. Last month, Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic said Serbia'seconomy grew 1.8 percent year-on-year in the second quarter --triple the pace of first-quarter growth.The central bank executive board will meet again on August19 to decide on rates.
