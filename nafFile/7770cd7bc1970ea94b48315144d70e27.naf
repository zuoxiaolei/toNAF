<raw><![CDATA[ * Bearish news spurs profit taking after long rally * Charges against Goldman, China property curbs rattle mkts * Asian stocks down 2.2 pct in sharpest fall in 10 weeks * Commodities drop as oil, copper prices fall * Analysts say sell-off temporary; corporate earnings eyed SYDNEY, April 19 (Reuters) - Asian stocks suffered theirbiggest loss in 10 weeks on Monday after U.S. regulators filedfraud charges against Goldman Sachs and China clamped downharder on property speculation, giving investors an excuse totake profits after markets had rallied to multi-month highs. The pull-back in equities was matched by a decline incommodity prices, while benefitting assets deemed to be lessrisky. Government bond prices, the yen and the U.S. dollar allrose. The sell-off looked set to carry over into Europe, withfinancial spreadbetters expecting Britain's FTSE 100 ,Germany's DAX  and France's CAC 40  to open asmuch as 0.7 percent. Yet some investors and analysts thought Monday's shift wasonly temporary, given expectations that stocks and commoditieswere due for a pull back anyway after recent rallies. "I don't see this as a beginning of a bear market," saidBratin Sanyal, head of Asian equities with ING Asset Managementin Hong Kong. "The market has gone up so strongly, a bit of acorrection was overdue." But Sanyal, who manages $2.5 billion worth of assets inAsia outside Japan, said that did not mean Asian equities wouldnecessarily grind higher from here. Asian stocks are already priced for firms to deliver strongprofits as the world economy heals. So they may drift sidewaysas investors wait for those earnings to materialise. Forinstance, Japan's earnings season moves into high gear nextweek. The fraud charges against Goldman weighed on regional bankstocks [ID:nN18153952] even though most Asian banks werenowhere near as active as their U.S. peers in the subprimemortgage business. The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan shed 2.1 percent, its sharpest daily loss sinceFeb 5, and retreating further from a 22-month high hit onThursday. In Tokyo, the Nikkei  was down 1.7 percent afterbreaching its closely-watched 25-day moving average. Top Japanese bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group <8306.T>fell 3.1 percent, while Mizuho Financial Group <8411.T> lost2.7 percent. Airline and tourism stocks also fell as flights to Europeremained grounded due to a volcanic ash cloud from Iceland. Japan's major travel agency Kinki Nippon Tourist Co Ltd<9726.T> lost 6.1 percent, and All Nippon Airways Co <9202.T>fell 2.4 percent. Singapore Airlines , the world'ssecond-largest carrier by market value, shed 3.6 percent. Shanghai stocks  fell 4.6 percent to just below3,000 points and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index  shed 2.3percent after Beijing announced fresh steps over the weekend torein in property speculation, which policymakers fear couldlead to a destabilising asset bubble. [ID:nSGE63H03N]. Property developers and banks were hardest hit. China Vanke<000002.SZ>, China's second-biggest home builder, skidded 6percent, while Minsheng Bank <600016.SS>, the most activelytraded stock on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, dropped 5.1percent. But traders said further declines would be limited in thenear term, predicting firm support for the Shanghai index atthe psychologically important 3,000-point level. "Both the property clampdown and Goldman news areshort-term factors, while a full recovery of China's economy isstill on the cards, preventing the market from falling toomuch," said Zheng Waigang, head of investment at ShanghaiSecurities. Worries that China may tighten policy too aggressively tokeep the economy from overheating have weighed on Chinese andglobal stocks off-and-on all year. The Shanghai stock index is down 7.8 percent this year. Yet, data from Thomson Reuters' Starmine Professional showChinese stocks are still the priciest in Asia, with a price toforward earnings of 15.7 times. Japan trades at 9.6 times. COMMODITIES, CURRENCIES Oil  sank nearly 2 percent to a three-week low ofbelow $82 a barrel [O/R]. Copper, which struck 20-month highs last week, also fell,though analysts said losses merely reflected softer shareprices and did not reflect the outlook for metal demand.[MET/L] The retreat in equities markets boosted interest insafe-haven government bonds. U.S. Treasuries edged up [US/] andfive-year Japanese yields fell below 0.5 percent to a one-monthlow. [JP/] Yields for government debt in Asian emerging markets,deemed riskier than their developed market peers, rose asinvestors use the chance to take profits after recent pricerallies. [ASIA/DBT] The yen , a poster child for safe currencies, rose asfar as a one-month high of 91.85, up 0.3 percent from latetrade in New York on Friday. The U.S. dollar  also got a boost, rising 0.4 percentagainst a basket of major currencies, as investors retreatedinto the safety of its liquidity. The euro  was soft $1.3458 . For the first timein weeks, Greece's debt woes were not the focal talking pointin the market. With a trip to Greece by European and IMF officials delayedby the volcanic ash cloud, no major updates were expectedbefore Wednesday on whether Athens will be forced to ask foraid. [ID:nLDE63H0MA] However, Greece will face a key test on Tuesday as it triesto raise 1.5 billion euros via an auction of T-bills.
