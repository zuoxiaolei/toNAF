<raw><![CDATA[ * Exports fall 49.0 pct to $20.54 bln in Jan-Jul * Imports fall 53.8 pct to $23.67 bln  (Adds details) KIEV, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Ukraine's foreign trade deficitfor goods shrank to $3.13 billion in the first seven months of2009, data showed on Thursday, crushed by the global crisis toless than a third of its size in the same period of 2008. The State Statistics Committee said the volume of exports inthe seven months to July fell 49.0 percent to $20.54 billion,while imports fell by 53.8 percent to $23.67 billion. The foreign trade deficit for goods was $11.01 billion inthe first seven months of 2008. The world financial crisis has driven down prices and demandfor the steel and chemicals that account for the bulk ofUkraine's overseas sales. The trade deficit narrowed because imports, undermined bythe devaluation of the hryvnia currency and tight credit in thebanking sector, fell even more sharply than exports.
