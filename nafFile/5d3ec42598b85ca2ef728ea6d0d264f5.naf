<raw><![CDATA[ * Markets await possible Fed move to prop up economy * Crude, copper down as China imports slow in July * Chinese stocks fall nearly 3 pct By Dominic Lau LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The dollar rose and world stocksslipped on Tuesday as investors stayed cautious ahead of likelymoves by the U.S. Federal Reserve to warn about and possiblyprop up a faltering economic recovery. Commodity prices eased after data showed Chinese importsslowed in July. Speculation has been growing that the U.S. central bank willat its meeting later on Tuesday signal a need for more stimulusto support growth or possibly restart asset purchases, as datasince the Fed's last policy-setting meeting in late June hasbeen weak. U.S. consumer spending is petering out and manufacturing islosing steam, while the unemployment rate is stuck at 9.5percent. Mere acknowledgement of a blip might disappoint someinvestors who have been betting the Fed would make a moreconcrete move, such as buying bonds to pull down market rates,known as quantitative easing. "We're seeing some squaring up of short positions ahead ofthe Fed, and there is some risk-off sentiment as well as Asianstocks closed lower, prompting a sell-off in high yielders suchas the Australian dollar," said Christian Lawrence, currencystrategist at RBC Capital Markets. The euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.3153 , sterlingslipped 1 percent to $1.5749  and the Australian dollarwas down 0.7 percent at $0.9103 . The dollar advanced 0.5 percent against a basket ofcurrencies . Against the yen the greenback was down 0.1percent at 85.87 yen . The Bank of Japan on Tuesday held off on new policy steps tocombat a stronger yen, saving its limited firepower in case thecurrency's rise accelerates and threatens the country's fragilerecovery. World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index eased 0.7 percent, and the Thomson Reutersglobal stock index  fell 0.6 percent.  CHINESE SIGNALS The MSCI emerging markets benchmark  dropped 1percent, with China's Shanghai Composite Index  down 2.9percent after data showed Chinese import growth belowexpectations, pointing to slowing domestic demand and economicactivity. EPFR Global, which tracks funds domiciled globally with $13trillion in total assets, said on Monday emerging market equityand bond funds attracted sizeable inflows during the week endingAug. 4 as disappointing U.S. data hinted at a weaker dollar. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300  index lost 0.7percent, led lower by basic resources stocks  followingthe Chinese import data. U.S. stock index futures    fell 0.5 to0.6 percent, indicating softer opening for Wall Street. Copper  fell 2.5 percent and oil prices  weredown 1.3 percent to trade below $81 a barrel, on concerns ofless crude purchases by China, the world's second largest energyconsumer. Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries  fell1 basis point to 2.8180 percent, while those on 10-year GermanBunds  were up 2 basis points at 2.547 percent. Societe Generale said it was bullish on U.S. Treasuries onthe possibly of more quantitative easing. "Scaring the market with an early move is a clear drawback,but acting late to fight the deflation risk would be even morecostly," it said in a note. "All in all, Treasuries might pull back a touch if the Fedfails to deliver today, but this will prove to be a buyingopportunity: the QE debate will come back soon anyway unless theeconomy or the inflation data quickly turn around."(Additional reporting by Tamawa Desai; Editing by JohnStonestreet)             ]]></raw>
