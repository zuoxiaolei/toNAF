<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The U.S. dollar remained sharply lower against the other major currencies Thursday, after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi vowed to do everything in his mandate to save the euro, while U.S. data sparked expectations for easing measures by the Federal Reserve. During U.S. afternoon  trade, the dollar was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD surging 1.07% to 1.2300. In a speech in London, Draghi also appeared to indicate that the ECB would be prepared to intervene to lower Spanish and Italian bond yields, saying that government borrowing costs would fall within the central bank’s mandate if they interfered with the 'transmission' of monetary policy. The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds dropped back to 6.99% from a session high of 7.38% following the remarks, while the yield on Italian 10-year bonds pulled back to 6.06%. The greenback was also down against the pound, with GBP/USD up 1.28% to 1.5697. Elsewhere, the greenback edged higher against the yen, with USD/JPYadding 0.09% to 78.24 but posted steep losses against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF dropping 1.19% to 0.9762. The greenback was sharply lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD down 0.58% to 1.0096,AUD/USD gaining 0.81% to trade at 1.0391 and NZD/USD jumping 1.52% to 0.8012. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.5% earlier Thursday and said there was still a “limited” risk that conditions in the euro zone could deteriorate significantly. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, dropped 1.03% to 82.81. Also Thursday, a string of mixed U.S. data sparked fresh expectations that the Fed will implement fresh easing measures to shore up growth. The U.S. National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index fell by 1.2% in June, disappointing expectations for a 0.2% increase. Pending home sales for May were revised down to a 5.4% increase from a previously reported gain of 5.9%. The data came after the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending July 21 fell by 35,000 to a seasonally adjusted 353,000, compared to expectations for a decline of 8,000 to 380,000.  The previous week’s figure was revised up to 388,000 from a previously reported 386,000. Separately, official data showed that U.S. durable goods orders rose 1.6%, beating expectations for a 0.4% increase and following a 1.6% rise in May. The report also showed that core durable goods orders, which exclude transportation items, fell unexpectedly in June, declining 1.1% after a 0.8% rise the previous month.             ]]></raw>
