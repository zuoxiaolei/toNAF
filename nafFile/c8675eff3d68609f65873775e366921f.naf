<raw><![CDATA[ BERLIN, March 22 (Reuters) - Germany on Monday rejectedFrench pressure for Berlin to boost domestic demand, saying thatEurope as a whole needed to raise its competitiveness to correctimbalances in the euro zone. French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde triggered outragein Berlin last week with an article in the Financial Timessaying Germany's huge trade surplus threatened thecompetitiveness of other euro zone countries. [ID:nLDE62E19L] Lagarde urged Germany to expand its domestic demand. But German government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm said in aletter to the same paper that Berlin had already taken steps tofoster demand at home. He also used the debate to focus attention on othercountries' public finances, saying that if those with currentaccount deficits could become more competitive they would findit easier to reduce their public deficits. "It is wrong to claim that German policy is insufficientlygeared towards boosting domestic demand," he wrote. Wilhelm pointed to reductions in income tax and socialsecurity contributions as measures Germany has taken in recentyears to foster domestic demand, along with an increase in childbenefits and a cash-for-clunkers car purchase incentive scheme. "That has increased purchasing power and domestic demand,"he said of the policies. "That some of these sums have gone intoprivate savings is appropriate, given that Germany's populationis ageing more quickly than in many other EU countries." Wilhelm said the key to correcting imbalances in the eurozone and restoring fiscal stability lies in raising thecompetitiveness of Europe as a whole. "The more countries with current account deficits are ableto increase their competitiveness, the easier they will find itto decrease their public and foreign trade deficits," he said. "A less stability-oriented policy in Germany would damagethe eurozone as a whole," he added. Germany was the world's biggest exporter of goods from 2003to 2008, when its was overtaken by China.
