<raw><![CDATA[Euro gains as investors applaud European bank stress testsInvesting.com - The euro firmed against the dollar on Monday after soft U.S. pending home sales clouded expectations as to when U.S. interest rates may rise, while solid European banking stress tests supported the single currency.In U.S. trading, EUR/USD was up 0.30% at 1.2707, up from a session low of 1.2666 and off a high of 1.2723.The pair was likely to find support at 1.2612, last Thursday's low, and resistance at 1.2840, last Tuesday's high.Pending home sales in the U.S. rose less than expected in September, dampening optimism over the health of the housing sector, industry data revealed on Monday.The National Association of Realtors reported earlier its pending home sales index rose by 0.3% last month, disappointing expectations for a 0.5% gain. Pending home sales in August fell by 1%.Year-on-year, pending home sales rose 1.0% in September, missing expectations for a 2.2% reading following a 4.1% decline in August.Moderating price growth and sustained inventory levels are keeping conditions favorable for buyers.“Housing supply for existing homes was up in September 6% from a year ago, which is preventing prices from rising at the accelerated clip seen earlier this year,” said Lawrence Yun, the association's chief economist.The numbers weakened the dollar by clouding expectations as to when the Federal Reserve may hike benchmark interest rates.While the U.S. central bank is seen closing its monthly bond-buying stimulus program likely this week, spotty U.S. data have made it unclear when rate hikes might begin in 2015.On Friday, the Census Bureau reported that U.S. new home sales rose 0.2% in September to 467,000 units, missing expectations for an increase to 470,000 units.The August figure was downwardly revised to a 15.3% climb to 466,000 units from a previously estimated 18.0% jump to 504,000 units.Still, the dollar didn't plunge, as a longer-range view of economic indicators still points to a sustained U.S. recovery, including in the housing sector.Earlier last week, the National Association of Realtors reported that U.S. existing home sales increased 2.4% to a 5.17 million units last month from 5.05 million in August. Analysts had expected existing home sales to rise 1% to 5.10 million units in September.Meanwhile in Europe, the single currency saw support after results of stress tests on Europe’s largest banks revealed that most of the region’s top lenders have enough capital to survive another financial crisis.The European Central Bank announced the results of yearlong tests to assess the finances of 150 banks on Sunday.A total of 25 banks were found to have capital shortfalls, but most have already taken steps to resolve these issues, the ECB said.Elsewhere in Europe, German research institute Ifo reported earlier that its business climate index slid to 103.2 in October from 104.7 in September. This month's reading was the lowest level since December 2012 and missed forecasts for a 104.3 reading, which capped the euro's gains.German firms reported that they are gloomier about current conditions and future prospects than last month, fueling fears for a disappointing fourth-quarter growth rate.Germany's economy grew by 0.7% in the first quarter of the year, but then contracted by 0.2% in the three months to June. The country is to release data on third quarter growth next month.Elsewhere, the euro was flat against the pound, with EUR/GBP unchanged at 0.7876, and flat against the yen, with EUR/JPY unchanged at 137.01.On Tuesday, the U.S. is to release data on durable goods orders and a report by the Conference Board on consumer confidence.             ]]></raw>
