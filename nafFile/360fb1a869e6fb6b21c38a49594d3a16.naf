<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com â€“ The U.S. dollar was up against most major rivals on Tuesday as rumors of an impending credit rating downgrade for Spain spooked markets, heightening fears that Greece's debt crisis will spread across the euro zone.The greenback was up against the euro, with EUR/USD slumping 0.77% to hit 1.3093 as Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service Inc. moved to dispel the rumors, stating they both maintain their AAA ratings and stable outlooks for Spain's sovereign debt.The rumors over Spain, which was downgraded by one notch to AA by Standard & Poor's ratings services last week, came amid concerns that an EU-IMF bailout for Greece would not work. Also Tuesday, German government officials said that Greece must raise funds from capital markets to meet part of its financial needs not covered by the rescue package, Reuters reported.Meanwhile, the dollar rose versus sterling and the Swiss franc, with GBP/USD dropping 0.58% to hit 1.5159 and USD/CHF gaining 0.79% to hit 1.0944. The greenback also rose against its Australian, Canadian and New Zealand counterparts: AUD/USD tumbled 1.11% to hit 0.9157, USD/CAD jumped 0.81% to hit 1.0189 and NZD/USD slid 0.73% to reach 0.7254.But the greenback was down against the yen, with USD/JPY slipping 0.1% to reach 94.44.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.65%.Also Tuesday, a closely watched monthly survey of purchasing managers showed that British manufacturing grew at its fastest rate in April since September 1994, boosted by strong growth in exports.Later in the day, the National Association of Realtors, a U.S. industry group, was set to publish a report on pending home sales, a leading indicator of the housing market's health and that of the entire U.S. economy.             ]]></raw>
