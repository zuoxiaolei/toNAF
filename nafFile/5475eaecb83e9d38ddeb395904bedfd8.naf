<raw><![CDATA[ * Violence in Western Sahara turns EU against fisheries * EU-Morocco fish pact must aid Sahrawis - EU fish chief (Adds U.N. Security Council discussion of Western Sahara) By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck BRUSSELS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Moroccan security force actionagainst protesters in Western Sahara has boosted opposition inthe EU to a treaty that would allow European fishing in watersoff the territory, activists and EU lawmakers said on Tuesday. "We will not accept an EU fisheries accord with Morocco ifit includes the waters of Western Sahara," Raul Romeva, aSpanish lawmaker and member of the European Green party, toldfellow deputies during a European Parliament hearing. Romeva, who has led debate on the issue, said Europeanlawmakers from across the political spectrum -- includingSocialists, Liberals, Conservatives and Greens -- are beginningto question the accord, which is planned for March 2011. At issue is the renewal of a four-year fishing pact wherebythe EU acquires the right from Morocco to fish in its waters,including those belonging to Western Sahara, a former Spanishcolony annexed by Morocco in 1975. That annexation prompted a rebellion by the oppositionPolisario Front. The United Nations brokered a ceasefire in1991 but a political settlement to Africa's longest-runningterritorial dispute has eluded negotiators. Polisario said in a letter to the U.N. Security Council onMonday that more than 36 Sahrawis protesting for better housingand working conditions last week died in clashes with Moroccansecurity forces and 163 were detained, and demanded a U.N.investigation of the clashes. The Moroccan government has denied excessive use of forceand accused Sahrawi activists of "brutal practices" includingcutting the throat of a Moroccan policeman. In New York, a closed-door Security Council meeting wasbriefed by a senior U.N. peacekeeping official on Tuesday onthe clashes and "deplored the violence," British AmbassadorMark Lyall Grant, current council president, told reporters. The meeting ended without immediate action, diplomats said.Developing countries and human rights groups want U.N.peacekeepers in Western Sahara to take on rights monitoring,something Morocco and its ally on the council, France, oppose. A senior Western diplomat said the divided council wasunlikely to mount the fact-finding mission sought by Polisariobut that there could be a case for it making a trip, possiblynext year, to the territory, which it last visited in 1995. SARDINES FOR EUROPE In Brussels, Ivo Vajgl of the EU Liberal Democrats saidEU deputies opposed to a new fishing deal should turn to theirnational governments for support. European fishermen widely fish the waters of Western Saharaunder a current 2007 agreement, mainly for sardines and octopusdestined for European restaurants and processing plants. Activists estimate about 70 percent to 80 percent of fishcaught under the fisheries accord are caught in the disputedwaters. That figure is disputed because of the difficulty intracking fishing boats and the fish themselves. The deal by the EU, which champions human rights andgovernance in its diplomatic and trade relations, contrastswith an agreement between the United States and Morocco, whoseeffects stop at Morocco's southern border with Western Sahara. Responding to mounting concerns, EU fisheries chief MariaDamanaki has said the EU Executive Commission can only proposea renewal if Morocco proves the deal will benefit Sahrawis. "For that to be substantiated, an assessment needs to becarried out. This assessment would have to be based on solidinformation and facts. There is no other way," Damanaki told EUdeputies last month. EU deputies on Tuesday said any assessment should includeinput from Polisario. Aminatou Haidar, a prize-winning human rights activist,warned against unchecked mining operations for Western Sahara'sphosphates and sands, which -- unbound by state-to-stateaccords -- are largely being exploited by foreign operators. "This will extinguish the mining resources of WesternSahara. It will have very serious repercussions on WesternSahara's economy and environment," Haidar told deputies.
