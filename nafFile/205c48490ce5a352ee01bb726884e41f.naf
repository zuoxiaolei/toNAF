<raw><![CDATA[ STOCKHOLM, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Libyan leader Muammar Gaddaficalled on Friday for the removal of 'unjust' rich-country farmsubsidies and more emphasis on helping the poor in world tradetalks. Gaddafi, who chairs the African Union and has ruled Libyafor 40 years, also urged the creation of a world economiccouncil, saying the Group of 20 did not go far enough. "G20 is not enough to deal with the problems that have notonly economic but social dimensions," he said in a statementdistributed to journalists at a European Union developmentconference in Stockholm. Gaddafi did not attend in person. Gaddafi's statement said the World Trade Organisation's DohaRound of negotiations should remove agricultural subsidies thatput poor African farmers at an economic disadvantage. "We do not understand the grossly unjust trading system thatpunishes the farmers in Africa," the statement said. WTO chief Pascal Lamy said on Friday the goal of signing anew global trade deal in 2010 was out of reach unless countriesaccelerated their negotiations. Gaddafi called for new rules for the financial system toprotect the world's poor, and global taxes on luxury consumptionto finance development. Gaddafi, who holds the titles of "King of African Kings" and"the Internationalist Leader", presides over Africa's biggestproven oil reserves in a country that ranked 52nd out of 179 inthe latest U.N. human development index. In September, he celebrated the 40th anniversary of hiscoming to power in September 1969. "We concur that democracy is important for development,however, we disagree that democracy, as expressed in westernforms, is suitable," his statement said.
