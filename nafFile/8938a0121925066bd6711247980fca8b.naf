<raw><![CDATA[ * Six new issues launched, make eight for the week * European banks have 391 bln euros redeeming in 2010 * Thrifty Santander opts to print despite wide spreads  By Alex Chambers LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - European banks launched a rash ofbond deals on Wednesday to try to plug massive gaps in theirfunding, potentially making this the busiest week for new issuessince the Greek debt crisis intensified. European banks ING, Santander and Banco Popolare alllaunched new issues, following similar moves by Barclays Bankand UBI Banca on Tuesday. Bank treasurers tend to wait for optimal market conditionsbefore borrowing on the capital markets because their netinterest margin -- the difference in price between where theysource funds and that at which they lend -- is vital. However, the Markit iTraxx Europe index, a barometer of thecredit market's mood, stands at 100 basis points (bps), versus alow for the year of 63 bps on Jan. 11. "I think things are better because there is less of a fearfactor. Investors backed off due to a number of factors," saidZia Huque, global head of debt syndicate, Deutsche Bank. After frantic supply from European banks in January, whenfinancial institutions issued some $146 billion equivalent,volumes tapered off dramatically to just $63 billion inFebruary, according to data from Thomson Reuters.

Negative sentimentfrom the rest of the euro zone periphery and on UK banks alsohit prices in, and investor appetite for, new issues. Just as it did following the default of Lehman Brothers, thecost of insuring against a credit default on a basket of financials exceeded that of the wider credit default swap index. The spread widened to 14 bps at one point in early Februaryversus 10 bps back in 2008. It currently stands at 11bps.  http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/0210/EZ_FNCDS0210.gif  Despite the widening in spreads, analysts at ING said thatcash bonds remained relatively well supported by investorsbecause of the technical strength of the market. According to ING, 2010 has seen a total of 220 billion eurosof coupons and redemptions paid by financials and corporates buttotal issuance stands at just 137 billion euros, meaninginvestors have cash to spare. "For bank issuers that are in a good place, from a creditperspective, they are saying there is not much point in waitingfor things (spreads) to improve," said one banker who heads afinancials institutions group (FIG) at a major bank. It has meant a hectic pace for deals so far this week, withjust under 6 billion euros issued from six banks and another twoyet to price on Wednesday. "This is the kind of pace we need to be at if we are to fillthe global financing need of institutions," said Huque. Thomson Reuters data shows that European banks have 391billion euros of long-term bonds maturing in 2010.  SOUTHERN COMFORT? ING's analysts said that recent market stability has seen aretracement of some of the excessive widening that affectedsouthern European banks. "Santander is very interesting. Them doing a deal is arecognition that the (widening) move is not a temporary thing,"said the FIG banker. Bankers said that Santander is very aware about the priceit's paying for wholesale funding. One of its UK banksubsidiaries, Abbey, pulled a covered bond because of price. Late on Wednesday, Santander issued a 1 billion eurofive-year bond at a spread equivalent of 105 bps over mid-swaps.In January it paid just 45 bps over 3-month Euribor for atwo-year floating rate note. "What is... interesting about today's primary activity isthe message the size of the books of a southern European Bankwill send to the market. A strong reception would be a bullishsignal for further Southern European retracement," said ING. (Additional reporting by Jane Merriman; editing by SimonJessop)             ]]></raw>
