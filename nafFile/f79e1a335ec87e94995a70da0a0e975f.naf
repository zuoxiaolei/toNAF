<raw><![CDATA[ * Investors cut back on stock holdings in January * Bond, cash holdings also ease, suggesting no panic  By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Global investors cut back onequities in January in the face of worries about the economy,potentially tighter monetary policy and in reaction to lastyear's stellar gains. Reuters poll of 44 leading investment houses in the UnitedStates, Japan, Britain and continental Europe showed an averageportfolio holding 55.1 percent of its assets in equities. This was down from 56.2 percent in December and level withwhat they held in March last year when the global rally inriskier assets began. But the polls also suggested that investors had pulled backrather than fled. Holdings of both cash and bonds -- traditionalhomes in times of risk aversion -- eased. Bond holdings were 33.7 percent compared with 33.8 percentin December while cash coffers dropped to 4.1 percent of abalance portfolio compared with 4.4 percent. The remaining percentage of flowed into alternativeinvestments such as property and hedge funds. On average, meanwhile, the 44 respondents were moderatelyoverweight in equities and neutral in all other major assets,suggesting that the long-term view of a recovering world economyis still in place. "We should be a little bit cautious in the first half of theyear. (For) the second half of the year, I would be quiteoptimistic," said Johannes Maier, head of asset allocation, fundof funds, at Germany's Postbank. Investors, however, have been battered so far this year byworries about the removal of pump-priming liquidity from centralbanks and by rising sovereign risk, particularly in Greece. On top of that, U.S. President Barack Obama's plans to scaleback the clout of large banks threw additional uncertainty intothe mix. "A sustained rotation to more defensive areas of the marketcould occur if investors become concerned about exitstrategies," said Chris Paine, associate director of assetallocation at Henderson Global Investors.  REGIONALLY U.S. fund managers stuck with big bets on equities inJanuary. Eleven U.S.-based fund management firms held an average of64.8 percent of their assets in equities, compared with 65percent in December -- the highest point in 2009 for equityexposure. The group also cut bonds. Respondents held an average of29.4 percent in January, down a touch from 29.5 percent lastmonth. Cash was cut to 1.8 percent from 2.1 percent. Continental European investors remained wedded to equitiesand other riskier assets. The poll of 12 European-based asset management firms showeda typical mixed portfolio to hold 51.2 percent of its assets inequities to 36.8 percent for bonds and 5.3 percent cash. Direct comparison with previous months was not possiblebecause of changes in the sample, but the survey showed strongappetite remained for equities, alternatives such as hedgefunds, and corporate bonds. Japanese fund managers cut their average weighting forglobal equities. The average stock weighting among 11 respondents stood at45.8 percent. That is below 51.5 percent in December, possiblyexaggerated by changes to the survey. The weighting for global bonds rose to 48.1 percent, fromDecember's 43.9 percent.  British fund managers eased back allocations to equitiesand bonds.  Allocations to equities among fell among 10 respondent to58.7 percent in January, from 60.3 percent the previous monthwhile bond allocations dropped to an average of 20.4 percentfrom 21.2 percent.
