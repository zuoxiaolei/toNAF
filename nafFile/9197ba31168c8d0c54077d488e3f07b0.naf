<raw><![CDATA[ * G20 source: Several models seen used to screen imbalances * Source: No single 'magic number' for imbalance thresholds * Source: Only big economies seen liable for remedial action * Source: G20 to hold door ajar for yuan joining SDR basket  By Jan Strupczewski BRUSSELS, April 6 (Reuters) - The world's top economies arelikely to set next week a cornerstone of a system for correctingeconomic imbalances, and open the door to future inclusion ofChina's renminbi in the SDR currency basket, a G20 source said. Finance ministers and central bank governors from the 20biggest developing and developed economies meet on April 15 inWashington to decide, among other things, how to use a list ofeconomic indicators agreed in February to detect worrying trendsthat could lead to global economic crises. Setting up the list was tough because China, which managesits currency to help exports and has amassed the world's biggestcurrency reserves as a result, blocked the inclusion of exchangerates and currency reserves in the set of indicators. But it does include including public debt and fiscaldeficits, private savings and borrowings, and balance ofpayments components.[ID:nLDE71I02C] Setting common numerical thresholds for signallingimbalances would have been even more challenging to agreebecause different economic models give different results. "There are now four models on the table, one is structuraland three are statistical," a G20 source with insight into thepreparation of the Washington meeting said. "If you give countries a choice, they will never agree onthe best method, as all have limitations. So what we will try toagree -- and I think it will go through one way or another -- isto use a combination of these methods," the G20 source said. "I think that we will reach an agreement, we aresufficiently close." A deal would eliminate the need to agree a single thresholdnumber for an indicator for all G20 countries, which would bepolitically sensitive for different countries and indicators. "Within each method of course there will be numbers, butsince the methods are different, there will be no single magicnumber," the G20 source said. "We would use all the four methods and if two out of thefour or two out of three say that a country might show excessiveimbalances, then you move to the next stage," the source said.  POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS The next stage would involve the International Monetary Fundand the country in question analysing the imbalances andproposing remedial action. G20 countries that would go to the stage of an in-depth IMFanalysis and then get policy recommendations would be limited to"systemically important" ones, the source said. If the screening methods are agreed in Washington next week,the process could start immediately with a view to having theanalysis ready for the next G20 ministerial meeting in October. Ideally, recommendations would be ready for a G20 leaders'summit in November, the G20 source said, noting however, that notimetable has been agreed yet. G20 finance leaders will also discuss an overhaul of theglobal monetary system, controls on the flow of capital,financial safety nets, how to identify which financialinstitutions are too big to fail and liquidity provision.  RENMINBI AND SDR Part of the monetary overhaul could be to include thecurrency of the world's now second biggest economy, China, inthe basket that makes up the Special Drawing Right (SDR) -- aninternational reserve asset of the IMF. Some economists say a bigger base for the SDR could help cutan overreliance on the dollar as the world's reserve currency. The basket is now made up of four currencies -- the dollar,euro, pound sterling and Japanese yen. Created in 1969 it doesnot reflect the rising importance of China. But the United States and Europe say China's renminbi couldonly become part of the SDR once Beijing allows the market toset the unit's exchange rate. Since this is unlikely to happen very soon, the source said,the G20 is likely to signal the possibility that the currencymight become part of the SDR basket in the future. "In the G20 conclusions it is likely to be phrased in a moreveiled way," the source said. (Reporting by Jan Strupczewski, editing by John Stonestreet)             ]]></raw>
