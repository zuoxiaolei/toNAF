<raw><![CDATA[ * Air traffic bans hit salmon harvest in Norway * Harvest volume cuts to prevent oversupply to Europe * Norwegian fish industry lost $5 million last week -analyst * Iceland's fresh fish exports put on ice * Shares in Norwegian fish farmers slump  (Adds quotes and background) By Wojciech Moskwa and Mia Shanley OSLO/STOCKHOLM, April 19 (Reuters) - The world's largestfish farmer, Norways's Marine Harvest, reduced its salmonharvest and Iceland put fresh fish exports on ice as air trafficwoes curbed exports. Marine Harvest said it would curtail its harvest volumesfrom Monday to avoid oversupplying Europe while exports to Asiaand North America suffer from extended bans on flights acrossEurope due to volcanic ash spewed from Iceland. Norwegian fish farmers usually send about 10-15 percent oftheir volumes by air, feeding the growing sushi industry, withthe bulk going by refrigerated road and rail shipments. Spokesman Jorgen Christiansen said the volume reduction wassomething Marine Harvest would have had to do regardless of thevolcano situation, as high demand from European customers hadled to fish farmers harvesting at a lower weight than optimal. Marine Harvest last week harvested salmon as light as 3.8 kg(8.6 pounds), against an optimal weight of 4.5 kg. "Due to low seawater temperatures off Norway during thefirst quarter (which curbed fish growth), and high demand inEurope, we are currently selling fish that are below optimalweight," he said. "This is the best timing to reduce volumes." Marine Harvest said it has flown fish out of central Europeas well as Scandinavian airports over the past few days todeliver to customers in the United States and Asia. "Even if this situation (with flight bans) drags on, demandis still very strong and farmers will have to match the demandto their supply," Chirstiansen said.   With the ash cloud crimping air traffic between Reykjavikand Europe, Iceland has been forced to put on ice fresh fishexports that make up more than 13 percent of its foreign-boundfish, the country's trade council said on Monday. No-fly zones across Europe have kept Iceland's fresh cod,halibut, plaice and haddock from reaching markets in Belgium,the Netherlands, Germany and France. "This is a nuisance because we've been building up thesemarkets for fresh fish," Jon Asbergsson, Icelandic trade councilgeneral manager, told Reuters. "It's now feeding into the frozenfish industry. It's being diverted into frozen fish for a littleless value." Most of Iceland's fish exports, worth an annual $2 billionor about 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product, aresent abroad on ships and have been unaffected, he said. Flight bans are taking an increasing toll on the industry. Curbs last week may have cost the Norwegian salmon industrysome 30 million crowns ($5.15 million), said Klaus Hatlebrekke,an analyst at DnB NOR Markets. European salmon prices slumped to38 crowns per kg from 42 crowns. Analysts said that the United States had become anincreasingly important export market for Norwegian producers,taking market share from Chilean farms hit by fish disease. "A week or two is not so serious but if disruptions lastlonger it can have major consequences for the entire sector,"Hatlebrekke said. "At some point in the summer the fish in the sea must beharvested and the inventories reduced." Marine Harvest has roughly a fourth of Norway's fish farmindustry, followed by Cermaq, Leroy Seafood and Austevoll. Shares in Marine Harvest, Cermaq and Austevoll were all downbetween 3.0 and 4.6 percent on Monday, lagging a 1.8 percentfall on Oslo's benchmark index.
