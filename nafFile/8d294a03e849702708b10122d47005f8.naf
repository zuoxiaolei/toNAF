<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The New Zealand dollar advanced toward a record high against its U.S. counterpart on Thursday, after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said it sees little need for the March 2011 "insurance cut" to remain in place much longer.NZD/USD hit 0.8736 during late Asian trade, the daily high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.8729, gaining 0.35%.The pair was likely to find support at 0.8609, the low of July 26 and short-term resistance at 0.8764, Wednesday’s high and the pair’s highest since exchange rate controls ended in March 1985.RBNZ Governor Alan Bollard said, "Provided current global financial risks recede and the economy continues to recover, the Bank sees little need for the March 2011 'insurance' cut to remain in place much longer." In March, the central bank cut the benchmark interest rate to 2.50% to offset the impact of the earthquake that devastated the city of Christchurch in February. The rate has remained unchanged since then.But the kiwi’s gains were limited after Bollard said that persistent strength in the New Zealand dollar "is likely to reduce the need for further official cash rate increases in the short term."The kiwi was also higher against its Australian cousin, with AUD/NZD slipping 0.11% to hit 1.2650.Later in the day, the U.S. was to release government data on unemployment claims and pending home sales.             ]]></raw>
