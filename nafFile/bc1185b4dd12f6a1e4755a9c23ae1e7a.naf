<raw><![CDATA[ * Obama says country moving in right direction * Says takes time to fix problems developed over decade (Adds pollster comment) By Alister Bull and Caren Bohan WASHINGTON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama onMonday said times were still tough for many Americans, as hedefended his policies during aggressive questioning after theworst U.S. recession since the 1930s was declared over. As audience members at a townhall-style meeting voicedexasperation and disappointment at his administration, and onewoman said she was "exhausted" from defending him, Obamastressed he understood that people were frustrated. "Even though economists may say the recession officiallyended last year, obviously for the millions of people who arestill out of work ... it is still very real for them," Obamatold the meeting, hosted by CNBC television. Obama's Democrats risk punishment in November congressionalelections from voters worried by U.S. unemployment, stuck near10 percent, and by the still-fragile state of the economy. His first questioner wasted no time in laying out hergripes with the Obama administration. "I'm one of your middle class Americans. And quite franklyI'm exhausted. I'm exhausted of defending you, defending youradministration, defending the mantle of change I voted for, anddeeply disappointed with where we are right now," she said. Obama stuck to his guns, arguing the measures he hadundertaken since taking office in January 2009 were slowlypulling the country back to health. "My goal here is not to try to convince you thateverything's where it needs to be -- it's not. That's why I ranfor president. But what I am saying is ... that we're moving inthe right direction," he said. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the officialarbiter of the U.S. business cycle, said on Monday the longestdownturn since the Great Depression ended in June 2009. But the pace of recovery since then has remained largelybelow the level needed to quickly replace the millions of jobslost in the recession, and recent economic indicators signalgrowth has softened again in the past couple of months. DEEP HOLE "Something that took 10 years to create is going to take alittle more time to solve," Obama said. Republicans are expected to profit from the uncertaineconomic outlook in the Nov. 2 midterm election, with pollssuggesting they may well capture the U.S House ofRepresentatives and have an outside shot at the Senate. All 435 seats in the House and 37 of the 100 Senate seatswill be contested. With his poll numbers under pressure, Obama's supporterswarned he was losing the communications battle with Republicansand urged him to fight back. "I need you to help us understand how you can regain thepolitical center, because you're losing the war of sound bites.You're losing the media cycles," said a small business ownerfrom Pennsylvania. Pollster Cliff Young of market research firm Ipsos said thepresident had an uphill battle in changing the narrative aboutthe economy in time for the November election. "It doesn't matter what he says right now. People havetuned out in some ways because they are not feeling thepositive impact in daily life," he told the Reuters       Washington Summit. Obama has sought to boost growth through an $814 billionemergency spending bill in February 2009. But additional stepsto use fiscal policy to lift hiring have been blocked byRepublican lawmakers worried about the record U.S. budgetdeficit, predicted to hit $1.47 trillion this year. The White House proposes spending a further $180 billionover the next 10 years to renew U.S. infrastructure, boostresearch and encourage corporate investment. Obama also wants to help consumer spending by makingBush-era tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 a yearpermanent, while allowing them to rise on richer Americans.Republicans want the tax cuts extended for everyone. Some parts of the business community complain Obama isvilifying them and this sense of outrage is shared on WallStreet, which fiercely opposed his shake-up of financialregulations that became law earlier this year. "I represent the Wall Street community," said one man whoruns a hedge fund. "We have felt like a pinata. Maybe you don'tfeel like you're whacking us with a stick, but we certainlyfeel like we've been whacked with a stick."
