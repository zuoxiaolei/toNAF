<raw><![CDATA[ * US dollar sags under weight of global imbalances pre-G20 * Fed outlook also weighs on dollar, euro at 1-year high * Market sentiment firmly to sell dollars on any rally (Recasts, updates prices, adds detail, changes byline) By Leah Schnurr NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slid to aone-year low against the euro on Tuesday just over $1.48 ascrumbling sentiment on the U.S. currency prompted selling aheadof a Federal Reserve meeting and Group of 20 summit this week. Traders took advantage of a dollar rally in the priorsession to sell on views the Fed will signal plans to maintainloose monetary policy well into 2010. Currency investors are also eyeing a meeting of G20 leaderson rebalancing the global economy this week, a process thatwould almost certainly require a weaker dollar. A document obtained by Reuters showed how Washington wouldurge G20 leaders to launch a new push this year to get debtornations like the United States to save more and exporters likeChina, Germany and Japan to spend more. "The big questions will be what will happen at these twomeetings, and after that you'll be able to get a strongerview," said Jessica Hoversen, fixed-income and currency analystat MF Global in Chicago. "(After) the FOMC meeting if nothing changes, and if themarket puts the G20 meeting in the rear view mirror, I thinkthe dollar does tend to trend lower." The euro was up 0.7 percent at $1.4785 afteroptions-related demand and strong Asian buying pushed it above$1.48 for the first time since September 2008. The dollar fell0.9 percent to 91.19 yen and 0.8 percent to 1.0244 Swissfrancs, near a 14-month low touched earlier. Sterling rose 0.9 percent to $1.6353, while the New Zealanddollar jumped 1.8 percent, after earlier climbing more than 2percent to hit a 13-month high after dairy exporter Fonterraraised its estimated payout to farmer shareholders. Fonterraaccounts for about 7.0 percent of the New Zealand economy. With no major economic data on the calendar, traders said$1.4825 may be the next target in euro-dollar, with manypredicting an eventual move back to $1.50. "Every time we get to a round number in euro-dollar, we'llprobably try to chip away on the way to $1.50. But for now$1.4825 is the next line in the sand, and then we'll have towait and see about $1.49," said Steven Butler, head of FXtrading at Scotia Capital in Toronto. DOLLAR IN FOCUS AT G20? European Central Bank Governing Council member Axel Webersaid on Tuesday recent moves in currency markets were "not outof line" given the euro zone's economic performance relative toother areas. Some said this suggested the ECB was comfortable with theeuro's level and was a green light to push it even higher,especially in light of the U.S. proposals to put fixing globalimbalances on the G20 agenda in Pittsburgh this week. But others said there is still a risk of dollar bearishnessengulfing the market and selling turning into a rout. "A discussion at the G20 on currencies, and especially thedollar, is not only appropriate but essential, as this movecould accelerate swiftly," said Maurice Pomery, managingdirector at Strategic Alpha in London.
