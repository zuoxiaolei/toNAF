<raw><![CDATA[ * Arch-hawk Andrew Sentance to leave MPC at end of May * Successor could tilt balance on nine-member committee * A female appointee would end all-male dominance  By Christina Fincher LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Britain's coalition governmentcould swing the balance of the Bank of England's rate-settingcouncil towards easier policy with an impending appointment,although it would risk new charges of interference by doing so. Arch-hawk Andrew Sentance departs the 9-strong MonetaryPolicy Committee at the end of May and his replacement couldradically alter the voting dynamics at a time when its membersare unusually divided. Sentance -- whose replacement is expected to be announcedwithin days -- has called for higher interest rates since lastJune and has won over two supporters this year -- MPC newcomerMartin Weale and BoE chief economist Spencer Dale. The remaining six members of the committee voted to keepinterest rates at a record low 0.5 percent, but minutes showedseveral would be prepared to tighten policy if the economicrecovery looked more assured. [ID:nLDE71M0TH] The government nomination is a sensitive one, not justbecause of the tussle on the committee -- one that even GovernorMervyn King has not tried to conceal -- but also on gendergrounds, given that the panel is currently all-male. "Sentance is by far and away the most hawkish person on theMPC so the balance of probabilities is that he will be replacedby someone less hawkish," said Ross Walker, UK economist at RBS. "There's clearly a lot of speculation it will be a woman butthe key thing is to get the right person for the job." While the government has stuck to the mantra that the BoE isindependent, at a time of severe budget cutbacks, it would suitit for monetary policy to remain supportive of growth in spiteof inflation that is twice the bank's target. The four "external" members of the MPC are appointed by thegovernment and serve a three-year term, which may be renewed.The remaining five MPC members are BoE "insiders" and comprisethe governor, two deputy governors and two executive directors. The selection of an external MPC member gives the governmenta rare opportunity to influence the tone of Britain's monetarypolicy debate, an area where politicians are traditionallyreluctant to tread. However, predicting the stance of an MPC appointee will votewhen in office is not always easy. Sentance's businessbackground led many to predict he would be on the dovish end ofthe spectrum -- something that proved not to be the case.  WOMAN CANDIDATES The MPC has been an all-male institution ever since KateBarker left in May last year after serving an unprecedentedthree terms, each of three-year duration. Only four women have served on the MPC since its creation in1997 when the Bank of England was granted operationalindependent from government. A number of women have been tipped, among them Vicky Pryce,a former head of the government's economic service, BridgetRosewell, the founder of several economics consultancies andLucrezia Reichlin, professor of economics at London BusinessSchool and a former research director at the European CentralBank. Other names touted include Sheila Dow, emeritus professor atthe University of Stirling and Janet Henry, chief Europeaneconomist at HSBC. Pryce told Reuters on Monday that she had not applied forthe job. "I think it would be a very good thing to have a woman onthe MPC but it was not the right time for me unfortunately," shesaid. She said current arrangements, under which "external"members of the committee are only paid for a three-day week, didnot economists in government or the private sector. "Being on the MPC severely restricts what you can do for theremaining two days. It may appeal to academics who can continuethat line of work but otherwise it's very restraining." If the government opts to appoint another man, JohnLlewellyn, a former chief of staff at the Organisation forEconomic Co-operation and Development, and Geoffrey Dicks, afounding member of the Office for Budget Responsibility havebeen touted as good candidates. However, a member of Llewellyn'soffice told Reuters on Monday he had not gone for the job. (Additional reporting by David Milliken; editing by PatrickGraham)             ]]></raw>
