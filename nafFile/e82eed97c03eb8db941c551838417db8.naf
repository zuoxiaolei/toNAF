<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen hits fresh 15-year high vs dlr after Noda's comments * Traders see no indication Tokyo ready to step into market (Adds quotes, details) By Stanley White TOKYO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister YoshihikoNoda said on Tuesday he was watching currency moves with greatinterest as recent moves were clearly one-sided, toning up hiswarning against sharp yen gains, but his remarks were not strongenough to stop the market from pushing the yen higher. The Japanese currency rose to a fresh 15-year high againstthe dollar and a nine-year high against the euro after Noda'scomments, which traders said gave no indication that Japaneseauthorities were ready to step into the market to curb yenstrength. "It's clear that recent currency moves are one-sided.Excessive and disorderly currency moves could have a negativeimpact on the stability of the economy and the financial system,"Noda told reporters in a hastily arranged news conference. "I consider currency moves to be very important and amwatching currencies with great interest." The remarks were a somewhat stronger warning against yengains than his past comments, in which Noda only said he waswatching market moves carefully. Noda declined to comment on the chance of currencyintervention. "The yen's rise has really picked up speed now, but all we'rehearing are really restrained comments," said Hiroichi Nishi,general manager, equity division, Nikko Cordial Securities. "What the market wants to see is a more resolute attitude, amore resolute response. But all they're doing is verbalintervention, over and over." Japanese policymakers have tried to talk down the yen as astrong yen clouds the outlook for the country's export-relianteconomy, which is already slowing. But the verbal intervention has failed to keep yen gains incheck, as traders are sceptical that Tokyo would resort toyen-selling intervention or that any such measure would beeffective.
