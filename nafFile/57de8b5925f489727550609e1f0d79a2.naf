<raw><![CDATA[ LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Britain's economy appears tohave rebounded at the start of the year after December'sweather-related disruption, Bank of England Governor Mervyn Kingsaid on Tuesday. King was giving evidence to lawmakers hours after datashowed British manufacturing growth matched January's recordhigh last month and mortgage lending picked up in January. Britain's economy suffered a shock 0.6 percent contractionin the fourth quarter, much of which was due to severe weatherin December which closed businesses and left many Britonsstranded at home. Minutes from the BoE's last policy meeting showed three ofthe nine committee members voted for an immediate interest raterise and others were prepared to consider supporting one if therecovery appeared more assured after the fourth quarter dip. "Surveys that we have for the beginning of this year suggestthat activity did pick up in the first part of this year," Kingsaid. "The nature of the recovery with the rebalancing going onmeans that it is quite likely that this recovery will be, in thephrase I used some months ago, choppy." King said the central bank was monitoring inflationexpectations closely but there was no clear evidence yet thatmedium term inflation expectations had risen. He acknowledged that oil prices had risen much faster thanthe BoE had assumed in last month's inflation projections butnoted that some of the factors driving prices -- such astensions in the Middle East -- could drive inflation down aswell as up. "An awful lot will hinge on how far this rise in oil pricespersists, whether the situation in the Middle East becomesclarified and it falls back again," he said. "These are very uncertain factors, these are the things thatdo move inflation around, not just up but down too." (Reporting by Christina Fincher; editing by Patrick Graham)             ]]></raw>
