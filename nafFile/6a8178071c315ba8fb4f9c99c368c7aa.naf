<raw><![CDATA[  * Wall Street, European stocks fall on disappointing data * Reported China interest in Portugal bonds lifts euro * Oil falls, erases gains; gold weakens from 3-week high (Updates market action, changes dateline, previous London) By Richard Leong NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks and oil fell onThursday due to disappointing economic data, while the euro hita one-week peak versus the dollar, helped by a report onChina's possible interest in "bailout" bonds for Portugal. This encouraging development for the euro zone trimmedsafe-haven demand for gold, pushing it down from a three-weekhigh set on Wednesday. Investor conviction to own stocks, commodities, and otherrisky assets remains fragile as the United States struggles tosupport growth and European policy-makers deal with thepersistent debt problems of peripheral nations. "Market sentiment is cautious. Right now the improvement(in U.S. growth) has paused. Europe is a visceral negative,"said Mark Pawlak, market strategist with Keefe Bruyette & Woodsin New York. Wall Street stocks and the FTSEurofirst 300 index fell about 0.3 percent. In its second estimate on U.S. economic performance, thegovernment did not upwardly revised its first-quarter growth of1.8 percent as forecast by economists. Adding to the latestbatch of disappointing U.S. data was a surprise rise in weeklyjobless claims.

The Financial Times quoted the head of the EuropeanFinancial Stability Facility (EFSF) as saying China and otherAsian investors were expected to buy a "strong proportion" ofPortuguese bailout bonds when the euro zone's rescue fundstarts auctioning them next month. See [ID:nL3E7GQ04U] The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.4149 , while Thedollar  fell half a percent against a basket of majorcurrencies. However, investors remain concerned about the possibilityof Greek debt restructuring, uncertainty over whether Greecewill agree new austerity measures and the potential forcontagion into the likes of Spain and Italy.

Tokyo's Nikkei  closed 1.5 percent higher, followingTuesday's in U.S. and European equities. In the oil market, U.S. crude oil  fell 93 cents to$101.37 a barrel, erasing earlier gains.
