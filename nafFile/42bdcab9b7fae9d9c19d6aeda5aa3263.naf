<raw><![CDATA[ By Jan Strupczewski BRUSSELS, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministersagreed on Sunday to create the European Stabilisation Mechanism(ESM) -- a permanent mechanism for resolving sovereign debtcrises -- from mid-2013. Talks on the ESM, which ultimately envisages privatebondholders sharing the cost of a sovereign debt restructuring,were initially due to take place in mid-December. But the discussions were pushed forward by concern thatPortugal and Spain might also be forced by financial markets tofollow Greece and Ireland in seeking financial support. Below are some details of the mechanism disclosed byEuropean Union officials on Sunday:  WHAT IS IT? The ESM will be based on the current European FinancialStability Facility (EFSF) which provides financing to euro zonecountries cut off from the markets, but under strict conditions.  WHEN WILL IT BE OPERATIONAL? The mechanism would become operational only from July 1,2013. The overall effectiveness of the mechanism would beevaluated in 2016 by the European Commission and the EuropeanCentral Bank.  HOW WILL IT WORK? All new bonds issued in the euro zone from July 1, 2013 willcarry collective action clauses (CACs) which allow a specifiedmajority of bond holders to overrule minority ones when seekinga debt restructuring deal with the sovereign.  Paris said the required majority would be 75-80 percent ofbondholders to reach a deal. The CACs would be modelled onexisting ones in the United States and Great Britain.  HOW WILL IT HANDLE DIFFERENT CRISES? The mechanism will differentiate between liquidity andsolvency crises.  LIQUIDITY CRUNCH: In a case where a euro zone government issolvent, but experiencing temporary liquidity problems, theEuropean Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF wouldconduct a debt sustainability analysis. On the basis of thatanalysis private investors would be encouraged to maintain theirexposure to the debt of the sovereign. The EU would provideliquidity support to the government in trouble without anyobligation for private sector involvement.  SOLVENCY CRISIS: If the liquidity crisis turns into asolvency crisis, each case would have to be negotiatedseparately to reach an agreement with the creditors. There wouldbe no automatic solutions. The country in trouble would have tonegotiate a comprehensive restructuring plan with privatecreditors and the ESM could provide liquidity assistance.  WHAT FORM WILL PRIVATE SECTOR INVOLVEMENT TAKE? This will be decided on a case-by-case basis, in line withIMF policies.  Among the options available, private investors could beasked for a moratorium on debt repayment, a delay in interestpayments and writedowns on the value of interest or even theprincipal owed to them by the government. The principles of restructuring and support would be thesame as the International Monetary Fund's and all creditorswould be treated in the same way.  HOW BIG WILL THE SUPPORT FUND BE? The size of the ESM in terms of billions of euros has notbeen decided yet, but Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynderssaid the pool of money would have to be bigger than the current440 billion euros of the EFSF. The ESM would function in the same way as the EFSF now -- itwould raise money on the market with euro zone governmentguarantees. No taxpayers' money would be paid into it up front.  WHAT WILL THE STATUS OF ESM LOANS BE? ESM loans will have preferred creditor status, junior onlyto IMF loans.  HOW WILL THE LEGAL GROUNDS BE PREPARED? Changes to the EU treaty, necessary to create the ESM, willbe discussed by EU leaders in mid-December.  (Reporting by Jan Strupczewski; editing by Timothy Heritage)             ]]></raw>
