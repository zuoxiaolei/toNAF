Major European stock markets were expected to open as muchas 0.4 percent higher, following gains in U.S. and Asianmarkets, according to financial bookmakers. U.S. labour and inflation reports overnight supported theprevailing view that monetary policy will stay growth-friendlyand liquidity will remain abundant while investor confidencebuilds, helping Wall Street stocks to an eighth day of gains. Investors have been pulling cash out of low-yielding moneymarkets at a record pace and pouring it into stocks and bondsin search of higher returns. However, the two biggest uncertainties in investors' minds-- Greece's debt crisis and inflation in China -- lingered. "Greece's woes are one of the factors that will continue tokeep a lid on the global markets, but on the other hand, manyinvestors don't seem to expect the most devastating outcome,"said Kenichi Hirano, operating officer at Tachibana Securitiesin Tokyo. The Greek finance ministry denied a media report onThursday that said the heavily indebted country was planning ongoing to the International Monetary Fund for aid in earlyApril. Japan's Nikkei share average rose 0.8 percent, led by bigexporters such as Canon Inc and Honda Motor, which gained 2.4percent and 1.9 percent, respectively. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was up0.31 percent on the day. It looked set to rise for a sixthconsecutive week, the longest string of gains since March-April2009, when a global equity rally began. Thailand chalked up the biggest equity gains in the regionon Friday, with foreign investors strongly attracted to thevalue and growth potential of the market despite persistentpolitical uncertainty. The benchmark SETI rose 1.2 percent andis on track to close at its highest level since July 2008. In South Korea, shares of Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd wereup 0.9 percent after Asia's biggest technology firm said it wastargeting double-digit sales growth in 2010 and planned forcapital spending to increase this year. "The global economy is likely to sustain its growthmomentum this year, helped by economic stimulus measures takenworldwide...but we see increased competition, which willtoughen our business outlook," said Choi Gee-sung, who tookover as Samsung's chief executive in December. The expiration of U.S. stock index futures, stock indexoptions, stock options and individual stock futures, known asthe quadruple witching, may cause very low volatility toincrease in the final hour of trading on Wall Street on Friday. Traders will have to settle contracts or roll them over. The euro was steady at $1.3615 after dropping overnight onfears that Greece's fiscal crisis may be a harbinger of what isin store for other weaker economies in Europe. The dollarinched up 0.1 percent to 90.45 yen U.S. oil futures slid 0.3 percent to $81.95 a barrel, withexpectations that the U.S. dollar would keep appreciatingweighing on crude prices.
