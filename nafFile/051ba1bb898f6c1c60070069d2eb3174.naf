<raw><![CDATA[   * Strong export data contrasts with govt concern about outlook* Exports may keep growing as global economy recovers* Toyota recall woes raise concerns (Adds details) By Rie Ishiguro TOKYO, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Japanese exports rose more thanexpected in January from a year earlier, allaying concerns thatChina's moves to rein in lending may choke off demand there andput a brake on Japan's economic recovery. Imports also rose from a year earlier for the first time inmore than a year as the world's second-largest economy shook offthe malaise of the global financial crisis. The 40.9 percent annual jump in exports in January may beencouraging for the government, which has expressed concern thatthe rapid recovery in shipments to Asia may slow down. Toyota Motor Corp's recall of more than 8.5 million vehiclesworldwide is also a worry, a Ministry of Finance official saidafter Toyota's president apologised in written testimony to bedelivered to the U.S. Congress. "Japan's exports will continue to be strong as domesticdemand in Asia isn't showing signs of falling off," said YoshikiShinke, senior economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute inTokyo. "The U.S. jobs market will rebound eventually, which willalso help. China's monetary tightening isn't aggressive enough toslow Japan's exports. Japan's economy will continue to grow." January's jump in exports was the third-biggest on record, asshipments to China logged their biggest rise since August 1985and those to the United States climbed for the first time in 29months, finance ministry data showed. The rise also beat economists' median forecast for a 38.4percent gain. Still, the positive signs likely won't discourage thegovernment from pressuring the Bank of Japan to combat deflationas Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's cabinet eyes an upper houseelection expected in July. "The Japanese economy continues to be driven by exports asdomestic demand remains weak and companies are only cautiouslyincreasing raw material imports," said Junko Nishioka, chiefeconomist at RBS Securities in Japan. Recent oil prices, in fact, accounted for much of the upturnin imports. "Exports may not pull back sharply, but a slowdown is stillexpected, meaning the government will continue to face the needto stimulate the economy," she said. Exports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan'stotal exports, jumped 68.1 percent from a year earlier, fasterthan the 31.1 percent rise in the year to December. Exports to China jumped 79.9 percent from a year earlier,while those to the United States rose an annual 24.2 percent. Gains in Japan's exports to China were likely exaggerated asthe Lunar New Year last year was in January, whereas this yearthe week-long holiday came in February, Shinke said. But he addedthat excluding this factor, exports to China were still healthy. March 10-year JGB futures rose 0.18 point at 139.59, butinvestors were reacting more to weaker share prices and a surgein U.S. Treasuries rather than Japan's trade data. Chinese authorities ordered banks to slow and in some caseshalt loan approvals in January. Beijing has also raised banks'required reserves twice already this year to slow inflation andprevent bubbles. These tightening moves caused global stock markets to swoon,but Japan's trade data for January and a record rise in SouthKorea's exports to China the same month suggest Chinese demandremains strong. Japan's trade balance came to a surplus of 85.2 billion yen($944.4 million), against the median estimate for a 108.5 billionyen deficit. A rebound in exports has been a major driving force behindJapan's recovery since the second quarter of last year, withshipments to Asia leading the way thanks to strong growth in theregion. Economists forecast that growth will slow down early thisyear as the boost from worldwide stimulus spending fades and asthe government cuts public works spending, though only a fewexpect the economy to contract again in the near future.
