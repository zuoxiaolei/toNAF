<raw><![CDATA[ * Count the added value not the bilateral flows * Trade deficits and surpluses seen changing By Jonathan Lynn GENEVA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - In an age of global supply chains,trade figures give an increasingly misleading picture of what isgoing on -- and trade statisticians are out to change that.Trade figures have become politically explosive -- witnessthe sensitivity of the U.S. deficit with China for relationsbetween the two powers. Trade is still measured in the traditional way -- looking atbilateral flows between one country and all the others.  Nowadays many goods are made up of components sourced frommany different countries, based on designs and research fromothers, and assembled in one before being sold.  Measuring where value is added at each stage gives a moreprecise picture of who is buying what from whom, and for howmuch."Economic reality is changing so fast that there is a needto change our statistics," said Hubert Escaith, chiefstatistician at the WTO. The World Trade Organization is keenly interested in allthis, and is hosting a meeting of experts this week. WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy cites a recent study by theAsian Development Bank Institute of the trade flows involved inApple's iPhone, assembled in China with components from manycountries then exported to the United States and elsewhere. Using traditional country of origin methods, the iPhonecontributed $1.9 billion to the U.S. trade deficit with China. But if China's iPhone exports to the United States weremeasured in value added -- the value added by China to thecomponents -- those exports would come to only $73.5 million, hewrote in the Financial Times on Jan. 24.  FROM BLACK-AND-WHITE TO COLOUR Deputy Director-General Alejandro Jara compares the newapproach to moving from black-and-white television to colour. This value-added approach will tend to reduce bilateraldeficits and surpluses, and could even reverse the plus or minussigns on small amounts, although a country's overall balancewith the rest of the world will be little affected. For instance the United States would have a smaller deficitwith China, but a bigger one with Malaysia and other countries. "The deficit between the United States and China will not bewhat it is, but is going to be less, definitely less," Jarasaid. "How much less? I don't know." Looking at figures in this way has huge implications forpolicymakers keen to defend or create jobs. "You may be focusing on the wrong cause of your lack ofcompetitiveness when you focus on one country," Escaith said. One obvious area for re-examination is bilateral exchangerates. Many politicians in the United States urge pressure onChina to appreciate the yuan and thus reduce the U.S. deficit.That may be the wrong -- or not the only -- target. Or it may turn out that offshoring -- having things madeabroad cheaply -- underpins more valuable research and designjobs at home. At this week's conference the WTO has invited 150statisticians from developed and developing countries to Genevafrom Feb. 2 to 4.  The meeting will lay out the research challenges for thecoming years and look at how to help developing countriesfinance the new way of counting. Research is likely to show that some countries, includingChina and states in Southeast Asia and the European Union, areheavily integrated into international supply chains. Other areas like Latin America -- with the exception ofMexico, some sectors in Brazil and Costa Rica -- appear not tobe, raising the question: Why? The new approach also looks at what combination of goods andservices goes into assembling a product, and shows that servicesmake up a much bigger share of trade than thought. To get a bunch of grapes from Chile to an Americansupermarket requires more than a farmer to grow it, Jara said.Transport, packaging, quality control, legal services,accountants, telecoms and agronomists all play a role.
