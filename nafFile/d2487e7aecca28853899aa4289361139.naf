<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar drops to lowest since Japan intervened last week * Dollar index drops to lowest in six months * Euro at five-mth high, Swiss franc at 2-1/2 year peak (Updates prices; adds quote)  By Anirban Nag LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Wednesday toits lowest level versus the yen since Japan intervened lastweek, with the dollar index hitting a six-month trough after theFederal Reserve raised expectations of more monetary easing. The euro vaulted option barriers at $1.3350 to a five-monthhigh of $1.3392 on electronic trading system EBS as investorsincluding a large U.S. investment bank sold the greenback andpiled into the single currency. But the market was wary about selling the dollar against theyen too aggressively, anxious it might trigger another wave ofintervention by the Japanese authorities that wrong-footed manyinvestors, including hedge funds, last week. "The Fed has lowered the bar for more quantitative easingand the market is just following the path of least resistance inselling the dollar," said Paul Mackel, director of currencystrategy at HSBC Markets. "Having said that, sellers of dollar/yen will have to bevery nimble as intervention risks are very high. We would expectthe Japanese to intervene once the price action gets tooone-sided." By 0945 GMT, the dollar was down 0.6 percent against the yenat 84.55, well off last week's high of 85.94 yen. It fell as faras 84.53 yen, still more than two yen above a 15-year low of82.87 set last Wednesday just before Japanese authoritiesintervened to send it three yen higher in a day. Many traders expect Japan to step in between 83.00 and 85.00yen. They said the authorities had called banks to ask if theywill be staffed on Thursday, a Japanese national holiday, in anapparent attempt to keep traders cautious over intervention. "I think they will intervene if the dollar falls to 84 yenor below," said Tom Levinson, FX strategist at ING. "Dollar/yenis pretty sensitive to the fall in U.S. yields, so it looks likepressure will be back on the Japanese authorities to intervene." Last week, Japan intervened minutes after the dollar fellbelow 83 yen, its first intervention since 2004.     Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan kept investors nervousby telling the Financial Times intervention was 'unavoidable' ifthere was drastic change in the currency.  RACE TO THE BOTTOM The dollar index, a measure of its performance against abasket of six currencies, fell 0.8 percent to 79.786 its lowestsince mid-March. The drop in the index came after the Fed expressed greaterconcern about sluggish U.S. growth and low levels of inflationin a statement that many took as opening the door wider topumping more dollars into the economy. A fall in U.S. Treasury yields compounded the dollar'sproblems, with short-dated yields at record lows after the Fedstatement, making U.S. debt less attractive to Japaneseinvestors.. "A break below the key 79.50-80 region appears to be just amatter of time," Robert Rennie, chief currency strategist atWestpac said in a note. "The coming weeks will be verychallenging for the U.S. dollar." The euro rose 1 percent versus the dollar after climbing 1.5percent on Tuesday, helped by buying by Middle East centralbanks, traders said. It firmed past its 200-day moving averageon Tuesday, pointing to more gains on the charts. "It is pretty much a one-way trade going on now," addedING's Levinson. "Investors are funding euro positions by sellingthe dollar. Also, this week the debt auctions went pretty well,so that's a boost to the euro." Portugal's sale of bonds saw strong demand on Wednesday,just a day after investors lapped up debt issuance from Greece,Spain and Ireland. The dollar also fell against the Swiss franc, dropping to0.9899 francs, its lowest since April 2008.             ]]></raw>
