<raw><![CDATA[ * Bankers campaign with regulators on trade finance * Encountering receptive response * To present default data and bank survey to G20 in June  By Jonathan Lynn GENEVA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Regulators are sympathetic to thepossibility of reforming rules on trade finance, but much workneeds to be done to demonstrate that it is relatively safe,senior banking industry officials said on Thursday. Bankers argue that trade finance loans -- simple short-terminstruments that are secured against exports and are liquidatedwith the delivery of goods -- are treated under bank capitalrules as if they are much riskier than they really are. Reviving trade finance, which funds about 80-90 percent ofthe estimated $15 trillion in annual world trade, but whichdried up in the credit crunch, is essential to underpin economicrecovery through growth in world trade. But in the aftermath of the crisis regulators are ifanything inclined to tighten rules on bank lending. Donna Alexander, chief executive of BAFT-IFSA, said that shebelieved the regulatory treatment of trade finance instrumentssuch as letters of credit was not intentional. "It's not really in line with the level of risk thathistorically these transactions incur," she told Reuters. BAFT-IFSA is the recently merged industry group comprisingthe former Bankers Association for Finance and Trade and theInternational Financial Services Association.  RECEPTIVE EARS Alexander, in Europe for talks with French and Britishofficials, said the association's work to convince regulators ofthe need for change was just beginning. "We're still in that educational campaign phase and we'vehad some very receptive ears," she said. British trade minister Mervyn Davies called earlier forregulators to relax restrictions on trade finance to reflecttheir less risky nature. A survey conducted by BAFT last year showed that many banks-- and a majority in industrialised countries -- found thecurrent rules for trade finance under the Basel II regimediscouraged them from extending trade credit. Alexander said BAFT-IFSA would be conducting a new survey onthe market, together with the International Monetary Fund, intime for the June G20 summit in Canada. Initial analysis of the default rates of trade financeshould also be ready for the G20 summit, said Dan Taylor, chiefoperating officer of BAFT-IFSA and vice-chairman of the bankingcommission of the International Chamber of Commerce. The chamber has launched a project with the AsianDevelopment Bank to create a trade finance loan defaultregistry. Taylor said initial findings, based on a first set of datafrom 10 banks and then widened to a broader circle, would bepresented to the summit. Bankers hope that the registry will put hard figures on whatthey already know anecdotally -- that trade finance is much lessrisky than other forms of credit. Taylor said he did not want toprejudice the conclusions, but said: "When you talk to individual banks, they are able to tellyou what their experiences are." Trade finance is reviving slowly as global demand picks up,he said. Major players in the market include Standard Chartered,Deutsche Bank and HSBC. After drying up in the credit crunch, trade finance receiveda stimulus at the G20 summit in London last April with a $250billion two-year package through the World Bank and regionaldevelopment banks. Alexander called on governments not to withdraw this packageotherwise they risk provoking a new trade slump and recession. "Our continuing cry is that we're not ready for thepublic-private partnership to dissipate right now," she said. (Editing by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Ron Askew)             ]]></raw>
