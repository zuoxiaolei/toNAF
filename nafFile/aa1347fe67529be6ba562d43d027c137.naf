<raw><![CDATA[ * Energy Secretary Chu says focus on tariffs premature * Chu supports more incentives for nuclear energy * U.S. business group has reservations about tariffs (Adds details)  By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The United States shouldfocus on cutting its own greenhouse gases and developing cleanenergy technologies before slapping tariffs on energy-intensivegoods from developing countries like China and India, EnergySecretary Steven Chu said on Tuesday. President Barack Obama has made climate legislation one ofhis top priorities and supports regulating gases such as carbondioxide blamed for warming the planet with a cap and trademarket on emissions. But Chu, a self-professed "energy efficiency nut," said forthe United States to cut its carbon footprint, renewable energyinvestors need stable prices. And he allowed that he wasconcerned about the economy as a whole as oil topped a one-yearhigh Tuesday. "Even $80 (a barrel) is making me nervous," he told theReuters Washington Summit. U.S. lawmakers, now wrestling with climate changelegislation in Congress, would support cap and trade market ifit includes border fees on carbon intensive goods imported fromdeveloping nations if those nations do not act to reduce theirown carbon emissions. But the carbon tariffs could be a headache for the U.S.government to administer and it's uncertain that they would beallowed under global trade rules. "You don't have to talk about tariffs yet," Chu told theReuters Washington Summit. "Let's figure out what the U.S. canand must do" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon tariffs have been backed by several U.S. senators,especially from manufacturing states hit by high unemployment. A plan for how the fees would work was included in theclimate bill narrowly passed by the House of Representatives inJune that promised to reduce U.S. emissions 17 percent from2005 levels by 2020. Under that bill, tariffs on imports of goods like steel,glass, cement and chemicals from China, India and othercountries would be triggered in the middle of the next decadeif the developing countries did not act on climate. Several senators have supported such border fees as aguarantee their homes states would not lose jobs and businessto cheap imported goods. To start off immediately considering tariffs "does no onegood," Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist said at the summitbeing held at the Reuters office in Washington on Oct 19-21. NUCLEAR POWER Instead the United States, which has less than 5 percent ofthe global population but is the world's top consumer ofenergy, should lead in the development of clean energytechnologies, like solar power, nuclear and energy efficiency,Chu said. That would boost the economy, said Chu, who has cut hishome's energy bills in half through measures like running fansduring the summer and putting insulation on hot water pipes. Chu called for more incentives for nuclear power in theclimate bill, which would help the United States produce morelow-carbon power. That could win votes from senators such asRepublicans Lindsey Graham and John McCain. The Senate needs 60votes to pass the climate bill, but it is uncertain if thereare enough. TRANSPARENCY The United States should also work to control prices of oiland rein in carbon permit prices in any future cap and trademarket to spur investments in renewables like solar, Chu said. The Department of Energy is working to teach big developingcountries to get a clear picture of petroleum supplies anddemand that could help cut down on speculation and keep a lidon prices, he said. [N2043841] Volatile oil prices have discouraged long-term investmentsin renewables for decades. In addition, Chu supports price limits on permits to emitgreenhouse gases in any U.S. cap and trade market. "Once youhave a price collar on this, that actually discourages a lot ofmanipulation," he said. Even though some lawmakers want a carbon tariff, a majorbusiness group has reservations. Bruce Josten, executive vicepresident for government affairs at the U.S. Chamber ofCommerce, speaking at a separate session of the Reuters summit,voiced concerns about climate legislation that could triggertaxes on imported goods."The United States is still the world's largest exporter ofgoods and services. So the country with the most to lose in atrade retaliation game is us," Josten warned.
