<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro slips vs dollar amid revived Greek debt worries * Traders eye EU summit next week to see if Greece gets aid * Euro/Swiss tumbles to 17-month low (Adds comment, updates throughout) By Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - The euro hit a one-week low onFriday, pressured by nagging concerns about Greece's deficitproblems as traders waited to see if Athens can secure aid fromeuro zone members at a summit next week. The currency had been knocked on Thursday after a mediareport that Athens saw limited prospects for euro zoneassistance highlighted uncertainty about whether the countrywill be able to service its debts. "The uncertainty over Greece is definitely weighing on theeuro today. I think the market doubts whether next week's summitwill produce anything more specific in terms of a plan forGreece," said Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING. Greece said on Thursday it could not achieve promiseddeficit cuts if borrowing costs remained high, and might have toturn to the International Monetary Fund. But it dismissed a report it was planning to turn to theglobal lender as soon as early April if EU leaders do not agreeon a rescue plan next week. "Greece is not off the radar yet. It will continue todominate headlines and weigh on the euro," said Sverre Holbek,currency strategist at Danske in Copenhagen. By 1110 GMT, the euro had slipped around 0.3 percent on theday to $1.3570 after hitting its lowest in more than a week of$1.3557. It was on track to end the week roughly 1 percentlower, its worst performance since early February. The premium investors demand to buy 10-year Greek governmentbonds over German benchmarks continued to rise on Friday.. SWISS GAINS The euro slipped over 0.4 percent against the Swiss franc totrade at 1.4320, its weakest since October 2008, in theaftermath of hawkish comments from a Swiss National Bankofficial. SNB board member Jean-Pierre Danthine said on Thursday Swissfirms and consumers should prepare for rising borrowing costsand exchange rates determined by the market as interest ratescould not stay low forever. "The Danthine comments have encouraged speculators to buySwiss francs. I can foresee a move towards 1.3500," said ING'sTurner. Traders were eyeing the next support level as the lifetimelow in the 1.4300 area. Options structures were said to beprevalent at that level. The SNB's statement last week made no change to its pledgeto counter excessive gains in the franc as it continues toappreciate against the euro. The dollar was broadly supported, edging up 0.3 percentagainst a currency basket to 80.516, and traded at 90.45 yenagainst the Japanese currency, little changed on the day. Sterling slipped over 0.6 percent versus the dollar, weighedby remarks from Bank of England policymaker Andrew Sentance, whosaid there was some risk of a double-dip recession in the UK. The Canadian dollar was boosted after Canadian coreinflation unexpectedly rose in February.. It traded close to a20-month high hit on Wednesday versus the U.S. dollar ofC$1.0071.(Additional reporting by Neal Armstrong, editing by JohnStonestreet)             ]]></raw>
