<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com- Last week saw the pound decline for the second consecutive week against the U.S. dollar, tumbling to a 3-month low amid concerns the U.K. economic recovery may be stalling. GBP/USD hit 1.5356 on Wednesday, the pair’s lowest since September 14; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.5434 by close of trade on Friday, slumping 0.51% over the week.Cable is likely to find support at 1.5295, the low of September 7, and resistance at 1.5567, the high of December 21.Sterling tumbled to a 3-month low after official data released earlier in the week showed that the country’s economy grew less-than-expected and the budget deficit swelled to a record high in the third quarter, while mortgage approvals in November dropped to the lowest level since March 2009.Meanwhile, the minutes of the December meeting of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee revealed on Wednesday that a growing number of policymakers worried about rising medium-term inflation risks.  According to the minutes, MPC member Adam Posen called for an increase of GBP 50 billion pounds to the central bank’s asset-purchase program, while fellow member Andrew Sentance urged interest rates to rise to 0.75% from 0.5%, while the other 7 MPC members voted for monetary policy to remain unchanged.On Thursday, in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Bank of England Markets Director Paul Fisher said that he expected U.K. interest rates to rise “to a normalized position” of about 5%, while adding that the possibility of an increase in quantitative easing by the central bank was less than what it was a year ago, “but it’s still not ruled out.”However, Mr. Fisher added that the U.K. economy may contract for one quarter in 2011, saying that, “The output growth of the U.K. tends not to be that volatile quarter-to-quarter but in this sort of situation when you are recovering from a deep recession it is not impossible to see contraction over one quarter”. In the week ahead, trading is expected to be thin in the run-up to the year’s end. Concerns over the euro zone sovereign debt crisis and an unexpected interest rate hike by China’s central bank over the weekend are likely to be in focus when markets open on Monday. Meanwhile, the U.S. is slated to release key weekly data on initial jobless claims as well as a report on pending home sales and consumer confidence, while the U.K. is to produce industry data on house prices.Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.
