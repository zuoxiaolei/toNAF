<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen rises broadly as risk aversion rises * Nikkei reports BOJ may be considering new steps * Weak U.S. housing data weighs on dollar (Updates prices) NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The yen jumped to a 15-yearpeak against the dollar on Tuesday on fears the global economyis slowing, testing Japanese authorities' resolve to stem thecurrency's climb. The yen's rise accelerated as stop-loss sales weretriggered in euro/yen at around 107 yen after the Japanesecurrency hit a nine-year high versus the euro. Traders citedmacro hedge-fund selling of the euro against the dollar. The U.S. dollar briefly pared losses against the yen afterthe Nikkei business daily reported the Bank of Japan isconsidering additional steps to loosen monetary policy. Japan'sMinistry of Finance may consider unilateral yen-selling marketinterventions if speculators drive up the currency, the papersaid. [ID:nN24264334] Declines in stock markets and far weaker-than-expected U.S.housing data had already helped buoy the yen and other safehavens such as the Swiss franc. "The market's obviously on high alert for some form ofintervention, but until we see it, the stronger yen trend willremain intact," said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.comin Bedminster, New Jersey. "With U.S. yields where they are,all simple intervention will do is give speculators betterlevels at which to buy yen." Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda declined tocomment on the chance of currency intervention, saying onlythat recent currency moves were one-sided and disorderly movescould harm the stability of the economy and financial system.For more, see: [nTKX006945] and [ID:nTOE67M02F]. Traders took his comments as a sign the authorities werenot yet ready to act to curb yen strength.

[ID:nN24196313] Investors "are buying yen as a hedge against obviously pooreconomic news in the U.S. right now," said Greg Salvaggio, vicepresident of trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington. "Wethink 80 is clearly the next level (in dollar/yen) now." YEN CROSSES The euro traded as low as 105.45 yen  according toReuters data and 105.44 on EBS  , its lowest since2001. It was last at 106.66 yen, down 0.9 percent on the day.

"However, the SNB was out yesterday commentingon intervention so that may in time come to weigh on the franctoo and traders will be forced to turn to the classic safe    haven, the dollar."
