<raw><![CDATA[Euro climbs to two-week highs vs. dollarInvesting.com - The euro rose to two-week highs against the dollar on Monday, buoyed up by expectations that the preliminary euro zone inflation report, due for release on Wednesday, would show that consumer prices ticked higher this month.EUR/USD touched highs of 1.3876, the most since April 11 and was last up 0.22% to 1.3864.The pair was likely to find support at 1.3813, the session low and resistance at 1.3895.The euro was supported by hopes that an uptick in the region’s inflation rate would ease pressure on the European Central Bank to implement additional monetary policy measures.In March, the annual rate of inflation in the euro zone slowed to 0.5%, the lowest since November 2009. The ECB targets an inflation rate of close to but just under 2%.The consensus forecast is for the inflation rate to rise to 0.8%.Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi reiterated warnings that further gains in the euro could trigger additional monetary easing to stop inflation from falling.
