But imports rose faster from the year-ago period, to$16.796 billion last month from $10.787 billion in August 2009.Imports in July totaled $16.316 billion. In May, Brazil's government announced long-awaited measuresto boost exports, including creating a lender, EXIM Brasil, tohelp in trade financing.
