<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds background, comments) BEIJING, Dec 1 (Reuters) - China has lifted its bans onimports of pork products from the United States, Canada andMexico, its quarantine bureau said on Tuesday, but analysts saidthe move would not likely lead to a surge of new imports. Earlier in the year, China banned imports from the threecountries on worries of outbreaks of H1N1 flu. After assessment of risks, the bans were lifted, the GeneralAdministration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantinesaid in a notice on its website (www.aqsiq.gov.cn). The lifting of the ban had been expected earlier by officialsin United States, the largest pork exporter, which exported $560million to China in 2008.. "The lift will not spur imports into the country," said GuoHuiyong, an analyst with Beijing Orient Agri-buiness ConsultantCo. Ltd. China's pork imports this year have fallen partly becauseChina, the world's biggest pork consumer, has increased its ownproduction, driven by Beijing's subsidies over breeding sows. Falling pork prices prompted Beijing to stockpile more than120,000 tonnes of pork. China's pork imports in the first 10 month were 110,000tonnes, only one third of 373,000 tonnes for the whole last year,according to figures provided by Beijing Orient.
