<raw><![CDATA[ LUXEMBOURG, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The current strength of theeuro does not yet cause too much concern, Eurogroup ChairmanJean-Claude Juncker said on Friday, but he added that he maybecome concerned if the euro continues to rise. Juncker also told a regular news briefing that he wouldvisit China with European Central Bank President Jean-ClaudeTrichet and EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almuniabefore the end of the year. "I'm not concerned too much by the exchange rate we areobserving. But if it continues in the way it started weeks ago,I could become concerned at a certain junction. Don't ask mewhere that junction is located exactly," Juncker said. Asked whether the weakness of the dollar and othercurrencies against the euro would be discussed by euro zonefinance ministers and the ECB when they meet on Monday, Junckersaid: "I would suppose that over the course of Monday's meeting wewill address the subject with the president of the ECB. We willtell you afterwards whether there is something new to be said ...but I would guess that the poem will stay as the poem was."  Juncker reiterated he did not like excess exchange ratevolatility and disorderly movements and said the euro zone was"always very happy" when U.S. authorities reiterated that astrong dollar was in the interest of the U.S. economy. He said it would be good if markets heard that message.  "The U.S. authorities made it crystal clear and I would behappy to see the markets take into consideration what the U.S.political and monetary authorities are saying in this verycontext," he said.
