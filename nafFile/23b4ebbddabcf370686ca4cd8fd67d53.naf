<raw><![CDATA[ * US employment grows at fastest pace in 4 yrs, boosts dlr * Euro rebounds; G7 finance officials discuss Greece * Euro on track for biggest weekly loss since Oct 08 * Sterling hits 1-yr low on uncertainty after UK vote  (Updates prices, adds comment, US data, changes byline,dateline) By Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the yenand recovered some losses against the euro on Friday after datashowed U.S. employment grew at the fastest pace in four yearslast month. Sterling hit a one-year low below $1.45 and fell sharplyagainst the euro after the UK election left no party with anoutright parliamentary majority. The addition of 290,000 jobs was far more than economistsforecast, bolstering expectations the U.S. Federal Reservewould likely raise interest rates ahead of central banks inJapan and Europe. "Overall, it's a solid number," said Joe Manimbo, a traderat Travelex Global Business Payments in Washington. "We did seea better-than-expected creation of U.S. jobs in April." The euro briefly retreated to $1.27, but remained above a14-month low near $1.25 hit on Thursday amid fears thatGreece's debt crisis could spread to other euro-zone states. Traders said sentiment toward the euro remained weak, evenafter Germany approved its share of a 110 billion euro rescuefor Greece. The currency was down 4.5 percent this week, onpace for its worst week since late 2008 and down 11 percentthis year. "It's very difficult to see how markets can draw a lineunder Greece, and they will keep coming back to the issue ofGreek solvency," said Adam Cole, global head of FX strategy atRBC Capital Markets. The euro was last up 0.4 percent at $1.2704, off a sessionhigh of $1.2797, but still far from Thursday's 14-month low ofjust above $1.25. It was also up 2.8 percent at 117.71 yenafter hitting its lowest level since late 2001 on Thursday. Thedollar rose to 92.50 yen, up 2.1 percent. Finance officials from the Group of Seven rich nationsconvened a conference call Friday morning to discuss the Greeksituation, although Japan's finance minister said he did notthink they were considering joint currency intervention. The U.S. jobs data came after Canada reported a record108,700 jobs gain in April that helped push the U.S. dollardown more than 1 percent to C$1.0385. Sterling fell to a one-year low of $1.4475, but recoveredto $1.4669 after Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said theConservatives, who won the most seats in parliament but fellshort of an outright majority, should try to form the nextgovernment.             ]]></raw>
