<raw><![CDATA[ * Risk appetite supported after US shares hit 9-month highs * Kiwi touches 10-month high vs dollar * Investors await BoE, ECB policy meetings By Masayuki Kitano TOKYO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The dollar was steady near 2009 lowsagainst the euro and sterling on Wednesday, after a surprisinglystrong U.S. housing report the previous day boosted hopes thatthe worst of the recession was over. The dollar has slid broadly since March as riskier assetssuch as equities and oil rallied on improving economic data,eroding demand for the safe-haven greenback. Better-than-expected U.S. second-quarter corporate resultshave helped reinforce optimism about the economic outlook, andthe dollar has extended its losses this week as data highlightedan improvement in global manufacturing activity. "When positive economic data comes out, people head towardstaking risk," said a trader for a major Japanese bank. Against this backdrop and due to firmness in commodities,currencies such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadiandollars have gotten a lift, the trader said. Those three currencies all hit 10-month highs against thedollar this week. The New Zealand dollar briefly scaled a peak of $0.6751earlier on Wednesday, its highest since early October, beforepulling back to $0.6727, down 0.2 percent from late U.S. tradingon Tuesday. Market players said the kiwi gained a boost after NewZealand's Fonterra Cooperative Group, the world's top dairyexporter, said international dairy prices surged at its latestauction, recovering after a recent run of falls. The dollar dipped 0.1 percent against a basket of majorcurrencies to 77.656, hovering near a 7-1/2-month low of 77.451hit earlier this week. The euro and sterling were little changed ahead of policydecisions by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Englandlater this week. Sterling was steady at $1.6933, hovering near a nine-monthhigh of $1.7005 hit on Tuesday. The euro was little changed at $1.4409, holding near a7-1/2-month high of $1.4445 hit earlier in the week. Data released on Tuesday showed that pending sales ofexisting U.S. homes rose for a fifth straight month in June, thefirst such advancing streak in six years, and that U.S. consumerspending rose in June. A big drop in personal income, however, pointed to a slowrecovery from the worst recession in decades. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's500 Index both hit nine-month highs on Tuesday.
