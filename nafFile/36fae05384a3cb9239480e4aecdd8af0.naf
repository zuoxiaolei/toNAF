<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds dropped word trillion to figure in 13th paragraph) * Obama to propose domestic spending freeze in FY 2011 * Three-year spending hold-down excludes U.S. security * Savings to add up to $250 bln over 10 years-officials By Alister Bull WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama,under pressure from deficit hawks, will seek a three-yearfreeze on domestic spending in his 2011 budget that would save$250 billion by 2020, administration officials said on Monday. Obama will outline the spending hold-down in his State ofthe Union address on Wednesday and will spell it out in detailon Feb. 1, when he unveils his second budget. Obama is under fire for a record deficit and has called fora bipartisan congressional commission to consider spending cutsand tax increases to improve the country's fiscal outlook. His proposed budget savings will need congressional backingand would exclude Defense, Veteran Affairs, Homeland Securityand spending on international affairs, the officials said. "We are in the midst of fighting a war and have securityneeds. We're going to fund those security needs as necessary,"one of the officials told reporters, speaking on condition ofanonymity. The officials declined to detail which agencies or programswould be hit, but said the overall freeze in so-calleddiscretionary non-security spending would not halt investmentin some areas, and would be balanced by cuts elsewhere. Adjusted for inflation, the freeze would mean effectivebudget cuts in those areas of spending, the officials said. Republicans dismissed the move as window-dressing byObama's Democrats after an "unprecedented spending binge." "This is like announcing you're going on a diet afterwinning a pie-eating contest," said Michael Steel, spokesmanfor House of Representatives Republican leader John Boehner. The 2010 budget allocated $447 billion to non-securitydiscretionary spending, or about one eight of the overallbudget. Agencies that could feel the pinch include theCommerce, Interior, Justice and Labor departments, as well asthe Environmental Protection Agency. The United States ran a record $1.4 trillion budget deficitin fiscal year 2009. Part of the problem, on top of a severe recession that hitgovernment revenue, are entitlement programs like socialsecurity and Medicare, the huge public healthcare program forolder Americans. Obama wants to reduce soaring Medicare costs through anoverhaul of the $2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare system, but hisreforms are bogged down in Congress. The officials said the proposed freeze would not affectentitlement programs but argued it could help set a tone offiscal discipline. "Imposing discipline here is one part of an overall pictureand ... helping to create a new atmosphere of fiscal discipline... can actually also feed into debates over other componentsof the budget," one of the officials said. The freeze would cut the deficit by between $10 billion and$15 billion in fiscal 2011. A total of $250 billion would bewrung from the budget by 2020, they said. But, the impact would not undermine the economy's recoveryafter the most prolonged contraction in 70 years. "From a macro-economic perspective, I don't think therewill be a huge affect in 2011," the official said. (Reporting by Alister Bull; editing by Anthony Boadle)             ]]></raw>
