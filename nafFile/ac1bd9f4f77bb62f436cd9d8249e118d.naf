<raw><![CDATA[ * Top EU climate official: U.S. "disappearing" as partner * Delbeke: Debate may resume on carbon tariffs on imports  By David Stanway and Pete Harrison BEIJING/BRUSSELS, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The European Union seesthe United States "disappearing as a partner" in internationalclimate talks after President Barack Obama suffered setbacks inmidterm elections, the EU's top climate official said on Friday. Obama has conceded that big Republican gains in Tuesday'selections undermined prospects for comprehensive legislation totackle climate change. "We're very disappointed about the United States going thatway and dropping climate legislation," said Jos Delbeke,director general of the European Commission's climate team. "We see the U.S. disappearing as a partner in achievingmeaningful climate action," he told Reuters in an interview. Obama's election in 2008 and his talk of saving a "planet inperil" briefly encouraged some countries to anticipatesignificant progress in talks on a new U.N. treaty to slowrising emissions of greenhouse gases. The U.S. election results have dented the few remainingexpectations for a significant result at the next climate talksin Cancun, Mexico, from Nov. 29-Dec. 10. Obama said at last December's Copenhagen summit that hewanted to cut U.S. emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by2020, a cut passed by the U.S. House of Representatives but notby the Senate. "We wonder how they can achieve their 2005 commitmentswithout going for a cap and trade scheme," said Delbeke. "Itwill make it even more problematic for international climatenegotiations." Cap and trade schemes cap carbon emissions by power plantsand factories by issuing a fixed quota of emissions permitswhich companies can trade among themselves. The U.S. reluctance to curb planet-warming emissions mayalso hit plans to raise a promised $100 billion a year by 2020to help poor nations cope with climate change. That plan partly hinges on curbs on emissions to push up theprice of carbon in mechanisms such as the EU's Emissions TradingScheme. But Delbeke remained upbeat that the Cancun talks couldachieve something. "Cancun can still deliver, for example decisions onadaptation and deforestation, while progress should be made onthe monitoring, reporting and verification question, but beyondthat, the outlook is worrying."  BORDER TARIFFS If countries such as the United States continue to avoidclimate cuts, while the EU keeps making its industry pay forpermits to emit carbon dioxide, trade imbalances will start tooccur. Some EU companies are already calling for border tariffsto be slapped on imports to restore the balance. "In the long term that may be a possibility," Delbeke toldreporters at a briefing earlier in the day. "If we live in a world where the EU is the only one that hasmade a commitment and the U.S. is doing nothing, and othercountries including China are doing nothing, then we would havea problem and I see this debate coming up. So far we have beenholding back," he said. "If China were to implement a cap and trade system thatwould be extremely helpful to help prevent such trade mechanismscoming into place."
