<raw><![CDATA[ BEIJING, May 20 (Reuters) - China will help the worldrecover from its current financial crisis by continuing to holdthe yuan stable, Commerce Minister Chen Deming has said. Speaking during a visit to Austria, Chen reiterated hislong-standing position that exchange rate stability wasessential to ensuring broader economic stability. He also said that exchange rate policy was a sovereign issuefor each country to decide "according to its own situation",Xinhua news agency reported late on Wednesday. The commerce ministry has been the staunchest opponentwithin the Chinese government for a resumption of yuanappreciation, after 22 months in which Beijing has frozen thecurrency at about 6.83 to the dollar to help cushion the economyfrom the global financial crisis. Some Chinese economists have said that sovereign debtworries in Europe offer Beijing an opportunity to let the yuanstart rising again, because the risk aversion sweeping throughglobal markets would limit inflows of much-feared speculativecapital looking to play the yuan's rise. But others have said that the potential debt crisis showsthat financial conditions are still turbulent, justifyingBeijing's prudence in maintaining its de facto dollar peg.
