<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro slipped lower against the dollar on Wednesday as investors remained cautious ahead of the outcome of Thursday’s European Central Bank policy meeting.EUR/USD hit 1.3554 during late Asian trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3556, sliding 0.20%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.3457, Tuesday’s low and resistance at 1.3658, Monday’s high.The single currency remained supported after data on Wednesday showed that the euro zone’s services purchasing managers’ index improved to a 10-month high in January, adding to signs of a recovery in the region.However, the report showed that the gap between Germany and France widened, with Germany’s PMI posting the largest one-month increase since August 2009, while France’s PMI tumbled to an almost four-year low.A separate report showed that retail sales in the bloc were sharply lower in December.The ECB was widely expected to keep rates unchanged at 0.75% on Thursday, while a post-policy meeting press conference by President Mario Draghi would be closely watched for indications on the future direction of monetary policy.Elsewhere, the euro was trading close to 15-month highs against the pound, with EUR/GBP dipping 0.05% to 0.8667 and was at 33-month highs against the broadly weaker yen, with EUR/JPY inching down 0.02% to 127.15.The yen weakened broadly after Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said Tuesday that he is to step down three weeks before the conclusion of his five year term in April, a move likely to speed up a transition towards more aggressive monetary easing by the central bank.Meanwhile, sterling remained under pressure as fears over the threat of a triple-dip recession and the risk of the U.K. losing its triple-A sovereign rating weighed.Germany was to release official data on factory orders later in the session.             ]]></raw>
