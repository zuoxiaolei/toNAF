<raw><![CDATA[ * China study questions 2 degrees limit to global warming * Says China can contain greenhouse gas emissions growth * Says effort requires major new spending * Experts say low-carbon path difficult and uncertain (Recasts to focus on global warming temperature target) By Chris Buckley BEIJING, Sept 16 (Reuters) - An international goal to limitglobal warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius appearsunreachable even if China embarks on a vast effort to tame itsgrowing greenhouse gas emissions, a Beijing think-tank has said. The report cast doubt on the prospects for the world to staywithin a commonly accepted threshold of dangerous climatechange, to avoid worse droughts, floods and rising seas, twomonths after world leaders including China acknowledged thelimit. China's Energy Research Institute also underlined in its newreport concerns among developing countries that a goal to halveglobal greenhouses gases by 2050, resisted by China and otheremerging economies, may cramp their growth.  Even if China embraces rigorous low-carbon policies, thechances were slim that the world could achieve that goal, saidthe report released in Beijing on Wednesday. "According to our calculations, these goals don't in factleave enough space for developing countries," Bai Quan, one ofthe researchers who wrote the report, told a meeting marking itsrelease. "You can't hang achieving this 2 degrees goal on China,"said Dai Yinde, deputy director of the Institute, adding that itwas up to the rich nations to lead with big emissions cuts of 90percent or more by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. Without these deep cuts, greenhouse gas concentrations arelikely to rise this century so the average global temperaturerises by around 2.8-3.2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrialaverage, says the study. China is the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, themain greenhouse gas from burning fossil fuels, and with enoughmoney and tough low-carbon policies, those emissions could peakaround 2030-35 and then by 2050 fall to the same level as 2005,the report found. IMMERSED Governments are immersed in negotiations seeking a newglobal treaty on fighting climate change by the end of 2009, andChina with its bulging greenhouse gas output is a key player. Chinese President Hu Jintao will present his government'sgeneral plans for tackling global warming at a United Nationsmeeting on climate change next week, the country's seniorofficial on the issue said on Tuesday. Wednesday's new report, "China's Low Carbon DevelopmentPathways by 2050," examines policy options that could help Chinaavoid emissions levels that could tower over those of the UnitedStates, long the world's biggest emitter. The report does not amount to government policy. But comingfrom a prominent institute that advises officials, itilluminates some of China's key concerns less than three monthsbefore the climate pact negotiations culminate in Copenhagen. "This kind of research confirms the impression that China'sposition (on climate change) is shifting and there's a veryhealthy debate," said Jim Watson, an expert on energy policy atthe University of Sussex who studies China's emissions. "That's heartening. But the numbers are still reallydaunting," Watson said in a telephone interview before itsrelease. "They just show the sheer scale of the challenge." BIG COSTS AND UNCERTAINTIES The new report builds on another recent report from theInstitute that gave slightly different greenhouse gas growthscenarios. If China adopts "low-carbon development", emissions fromburning fossil fuels could peak at 2.4 billion tonnes of carbona year by 2035 and then remain close to that level for at least15 years. Under current trends they could reach 3.3 billiontonnes of carbon a year by 2050, compared with global carbonemissions of about 8.5 billion tonnes now. Under an "enhanced low carbon scenario" of more stringentsteps, China's emissions could peak at 2.2 billion tonnes around2035 and fall to 1.4 billion tonnes in 2050. But achieving majorreductions in emissions will carry a big cost, the report said. A low-carbon growth path would cost about 1.7 trillion yuan($249 billion) extra a year by 2030 for energy-efficientindustry, transport and buildings, and similar levels in 2050, agraph and data in the study indicated. China's current growth stimulus package amounts to 4trillion yuan, including bank loans, spent across two years. Bai, the researcher, said China could follow the low-carbonpath described in the report only with intense difficulty, andthe enhanced low-carbon path was virtually out of reach.
