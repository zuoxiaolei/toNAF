<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar slipped lower against the Swiss franc on Monday, but remained supported as caution ahead of a meeting of euro zone finance ministers later in the day supported demand for the safe haven greenback. USD/CHF hit 0.9312 during European morning trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.9324, falling 0.21%.  The pair was likely to find support at 0.9287, the low of January 16 and resistance at 0.9389, the high of January 18. Markets were jittery as the euro group of euro zone finance ministers was to hold talks to discuss how the euro zoneâ€™s permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism can provide direct aid to banks.On Friday Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing chairman of the eurogroup endorsed Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem as a "good" candidate to take over his job. The appointment will be closely watched as the head of the eurogroup plays a vital role forming a policy response to the debt crisis.  Meanwhile, market sentiment found some support amid hopes for a short-term agreement to break the deadlock in U.S. budget negotiations after U.S. Republicans said Friday they would hold a vote this week to grant a three-month debt limit extension to give Congress time to pass a budget. The Swissie was higher against the euro with EUR/CHF shedding 0.27%, to hit 1.2409.  Trade was expected to remain subdued on Monday, with U.S. markets closed for a holiday.             ]]></raw>
