The outlook on the new rating is negative, in a sign that another downgrade is likely in the short-to-medium term.Meanwhile, concerns over strength of the U.S. economic recovery were underlined after data on Wednesday showed that U.S. private-sector employment growth slowed sharply in May, while manufacturing activity slumped to a one-year low.The kiwi was also lower against its Australian cousin, with AUD/NZD rising 0.40% to hit 1.3072.Earlier Thursday, official data showed that Australian retail sales rose by the most in 17 months in April, as the economy recovered from its worst quarterly contraction in two decades.             ]]></raw>
