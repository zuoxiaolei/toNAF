<raw><![CDATA[  * Euro falls vs Swiss franc * Euro implied volatilities rise * Contagion fears weigh as peripheral bond spreads widen (Updates prices, adds quote) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro slid across the boardon Tuesday, plunging to 2-1/2-month lows against the U.S.dollar, with losses seen accelerating on nagging worries abouteuro zone sovereign debt. A financial rescue deal for Ireland failed to containcontagion fears as the euro fell below the critical $1.30 leveland investors took out many options barriers on the way. Thenext key figure to watch, traders said, is $1.2794, the 61.8percent retracement of the June to November rally. The euro was down nearly 7 percent on the month, on trackfor its worst monthly performance since May when Greecereceived a 110-billion-euro bailout. In tandem with euro weakness, the premiums investors demandto hold Spanish and Italian sovereign bonds over German debtjumped to lifetime highs while yields on Portuguese, Irish andBelgian bonds also widened. "Europe is making some very bad decisions with respect tothe whole region and the currency," said Peter Schiff, chiefexecutive officer at Euro Pacific Capital, an asset managementfirm overseeing customer accounts of about $3 billion. "They should not have bailed out Greece and Ireland, theyshould have allowed them to restructure their debt, and allowedtheir bondholders to take losses. Countries would now want togo into debt because they want those bailouts and the countriesthat are responsible get stuck with the bill," said theConnecticut-based Schiff. Analysts suggested that given the sharply negativesentiment on euro zone assets, the European Central Bank shouldtake a more active hand in managing the crisis. As a result,talk of an ECB quantitative easing would not be surprising,said Boris Schlossberg, director of FX research at GFT in NewYork. The ECB's meeting this Thursday is therefore crucial asinvestors will be looking for comments on how the bank couldhelp address growing hysteria in the credit and currencymarket. It is also widely expected to keep rates on hold andsources say it could extend banks' access to unlimitedthree-month funds beyond January. KEY TECHNICAL LEVELS The euro fell to $1.2969 on EBS, its lowest since Sept. 15,before recovering to $1.3022, still down 0.7 percent. Sometraders said there is minor support at $1.2920, the Sept. 6high. That level preceded a steep rally in the euro that tookit all the way to that early November high at $1.4283. A slew of strong U.S. economic data lifted risk sentiment abit midday, drawing bids away from the safe-haven dollar andgiving the heavily battered euro some reprieve. Some traders said $1.3040 could act as resistance on anyintraday rebound. Other euro-zone-linked assets such as euro exchange-tradedfunds also fared poorly on Tuesday. The CurrencyShares EuroTrust traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange was down 0.7percent at $129.83 after hitting a 2-1/2-month low at $129.23.This ETF holds euro on-demand deposits in euro-denominated bankaccounts. Traders said the ease with which the euro had broken keylevels in recent days reflected the extent of negativesentiment towards the currency, which has lost roughly 9percent against the dollar since its peak this month. Euro/dollar implied volatilities spiked on Tuesday to apeak of 15.55 percent, the highest since at least June,suggesting nervousness about the euro zone currency. The one-month 25-delta risk reversals, a gauge of currencysentiment, traded as low as -2.85 vols for euro puts versus aclose of -2.73 on Monday. Further reflecting the euro's negative bias, the latestpositioning data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commissionshowed speculators going net short on the euro for the firsttime since Sept. 14. The euro zone single currency slid to 1.2934 Swiss francs,108.33 yen, and 83.520 pence against sterling, all more than10-week lows. With the spotlight on the euro, the dollar continued togain, hitting a more than two-month high at 81.444 against acurrency basket, lifted by safe-haven flows and recent evidenceof an improving U.S. economy. It last traded up nearly 0.3percent at 81.058. (Editing by James Dalgleish)             ]]></raw>
