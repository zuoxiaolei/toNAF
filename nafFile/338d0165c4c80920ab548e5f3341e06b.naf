<raw><![CDATA[ * Firms take long dollar positions ahead of April polls * But central bank appears determined to support naira * To start selling forex forwards next week * Bond yields rise at auction amid fiscal concerns * But foreign reserves stabilising due to high oil price  By Chijioke Ohuocha LAGOS, March 17 (Reuters) - The Nigerian central bank looksset to win a showdown with the foreign exchange market as itresists pressure for major depreciation of the naira ahead ofnational elections. Businesses and rich Nigerians are going long on dollars tohedge against the risk of any prolonged political upheaval orsecurity problems due to the April 9 presidential vote, in whichPresident Goodluck Jonathan faces a determined challenge fromhis main rival, ex-military ruler Muhammadu Buhari. A downtrend in Nigeria's foreign exchange reserves has addedto the market's jitters. The International Monetary Fund warnedlast month that the naira could become subject to "intensespeculation" if the reserves continued to fall, and recommendedgreater exchange rate flexibility. [ID:nLDE71G1O1] But central bank governor Lamido Sanusi, who has woninternational praise for his clean-up of Nigeria's debt-riddenbanking system, insists the naira is flexible enough. He has repeatedly said a stable exchange rate is key tomaintaining investor confidence, and told Reuters two weeks agothat devaluing the naira would increase Nigeria's import billand fuel inflation. Some clever maneouvering by the central bank in the market,and a recent improvement in the foreign exchange reserves, nowsuggest it will probably succeed in keeping the naira in a corridor of plus or minus 3 percent around 150 to thedollar, as it has been doing for over a year. "We remain confident in the sustainability of the 150 leveldespite the current naira weakness, notably given the country'sfavourable external fundamentals, the tightening in monetaryconditions and, to a lesser extent...the nearly flat spendingoutlook implied by this year's budget," said Samir Gadio,emerging markets strategist at Standard Bank.  WEAKNESS The naira edged down to trade around 156.90 against thedollar on Thursday, its lowest level in about 18 months,compared to 155.10 at the start of the week and 153.40 aroundtwo weeks ago. [ID:LDE72E25A] Dollar supplies from the central bank at its bi-weeklyauctions have slowed the decline but have not been large enoughto halt it. Traders say strong dollar demand from companies withunconfirmed letters of credit, payments on foreign credit cardsand large foreign exchange purchases by bureaux de change areeating up dollar supplies in the interbank market. "I see the naira going up to 158 depending on whether thecentral bank is willing to defend it," said a treasury executiveat a multinational consumer goods firm. The executive said a rate of 160 would affect his company'soperations. "Anything above 155 naira would be a worry andanything above 160 naira, we would have to put contingencymeasures in place like forward contracts," he said. "Any increase in forex charges would be added to our bottomline and reduce our profits, and it's got the potential toincrease our prices and affect our operations." A senior commercial banker, noting the shallowness of theforeign exchange market meant a single large deal could shiftthe rate significantly, said Nigeria's reserves were a concern.Their decline over the past year, despite rising oil prices, hasraised questions among some analysts about the quality of thegovernment's economic management. "Reserves of $37 billion would not anchor the currency inthe event of a concerted market drive against the naira," thebanker said. Fiscal policy is another concern for investors. The Senateon Wednesday passed a 4.972 trillion naira ($32 billion) 2011budget, increasing spending plans from Jonathan's initialproposal three months ago. Over half of the planned spending isrecurrent, meaning Nigeria is spending more on keepinggovernment running than on badly needed new infrastructure anddevelopment projects. [ID:nLDE72F229] A Nigerian government bond auction on Thursday suggestedsome investor disquiet about fiscal policy and the currency.Five-year paper was sold at a marginal rate of 12 percent, upfrom 11 percent last month, and three-year paper at 10.50percent against 9.25 percent. [ID:nLDE72G1F4]  SUPPORT Nevertheless, the treasury executive at the multinational,and many analysts, said they expected the naira to recover tonormal levels after next month's elections to the presidency,parliament and state governorships. Nigeria only emerged from military rule just over a decadeago, and all of its elections since then have been marred byrigging and intimidation. But this has not seriously threatenedstability at a national level and Jonathan remains the favouriteto win, though the opposition is hoping to force a run-off vote. Recently there has been good news on the foreign reserves;they rebounded to $36.4 billion on March 8, up 10 percent fromthe end of February, though they remained well down from $42billion a year ago, according to the central bank. The government has attributed reserves' decline in the pastyear to counter-cyclical spending during an economic downturn,the defence of the naira, seed capital for a planned sovereignwealth fund, and financing for infrastructure projects. Those explanations do not fully satisfy everyone, butauthorities insist that with oil output and prices rising,reserves will build up once again. And the central bank has taken some clever administrativesteps to reduce pressure on the naira. It has asked banks buyingforeign exchange at its auctions to submit lists of customersfor which the purchases are occurring, to verify the demand isfor commerce rather than for speculation. It also plans to start selling short-tenored forex forwardcontracts from next Wednesday as part of efforts to smoothdemand and help businesses hedge their currency risk. This couldreduce the threat of panicky sales of naira. [ID:nLDE710265] Razia Khan, economist for Africa at Standard Chartered Bank,said the current naira corridor might conceivably be shifted,but only carefully and gradually. "We all believe that the mid-point is around 150 but thereis nothing to stop the central bank adjusting it up gradually inresponse to high demand...and then maybe allowing it to go downagain when conditions allow. "Do we think that they are about to announce a bigdevaluation in the naira? No. But do we think the recentlyannounced spending plans are going to create more pressure onthe currency? Yes."
