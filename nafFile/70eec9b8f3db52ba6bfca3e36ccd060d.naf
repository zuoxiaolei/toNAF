<raw><![CDATA[ * Risky positions cut as econ outlook remains uncertain * Aussie, C$ give up earlier gains and fall * Euro slides after hitting stops, rumour on Merkel By Satomi Noguchi TOKYO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The dollar and yen rose on Friday,reversing earlier losses against other major currencies such asthe Aussie, as investors were cautious of building riskierpositions while the global economic outlook remains uncertain. Earlier, currencies leveraged to global growth, such as theAustralian and Canadian dollars, were firmer after upbeatearnings from technology bellwether Intel Corp encouraged someinvestors to add positions in risky assets. But others sold those currencies, after Thursday'sweaker-than-expected U.S. retail data for December and higherjobless claims cemented a view that U.S. interest rates arelikely to remain low. "The market is just stuck in a range after the weak datafurther complicated market views about higher rates in the U.S.,"said a senior sales trader for a Japanese bank. The euro slipped quickly after hitting stops, and was dentedby a market rumour that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was toresign, although traders gave the rumour little credence, sayingit was an excuse to sell the currency to move it out of a recenttight range. "The rumour about Merkel resigning has taken the euro lower,but it sounds like rubbish to me," said one trader. The Australian dollar fell 0.5 percent to $0.9273, afterrising near a two-month high of $0.9331 hit the previous day. Itfell 0.6 percent against the yen to 84.46 yen, after climbingabove 85 yen earlier. The Canadian dollar also fell after hitting a three-monthhigh at C$1.0225 the previous day. Both Australia and Canada arebig commodity exporters and their currencies tend to advance wheninvestors grow optimistic about global growth. The U.S. dollar index was higher at 77.049, up 0.4 percent onthe day. The euro slid 0.5 percent to $1.4428 after breaking belowThursday's low of $1.4445 where traders cited euro-selling orderswere placed. The euro slipped 0.6 percent to 131.44 yen, dragging thedollar with it to 91.10 yen, down 0.1 percent on the day. The euro had been been under pressure after European CentralBank President Jean-Claude Trichet reiterated the importance of astrong dollar and highlighted the fiscal challenges to a numberof eurozone countries. He also mentioned Greece and said the country had much workahead. Investor confidence in Greece has fallen as its deficit hasballooned and credit ratings have been cut, weighing down on theeuro in the past couple of months.(Editing by David Dolan)             ]]></raw>
