<raw><![CDATA[ * EU looks to ease funding pressure on Greece * Doubts linger over contagion from euro zone debt crisis * Strong company earnings support appetite for stocks * Gold, bonds fall on reduced investor pessimism (Updates market action, changes dateline, previous London) By Richard Leong NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - World stocks and the eurorose on Thursday, after news of a plan to use the Europeanbailout fund to make cheap loans to heavily indebtedgovernments in the euro zone region. The new proposal from the leaders summit in Brusselsreduced fears the debt crisis would spread to other euro zonecountries and led traders to cut their holdings of gold andU.S. and German government bonds. The European Financial Stability Facility, the euro zone'sbailout fund, will provide loans to Greece, Ireland andPortugal at a lower interest rate and for longer maturities,according to draft summit conclusions seen by Reuters. Loans from the EFSF will be extended from 7.5 years to atleast 15 years and the interest rate will be lowered fromaround 4.5 percent currently, in the case of Greece andPortugal, to around 3.5 percent, the draft document said. Formore, see [ID:nB5E7HN032] "It seems like they may have some solution rather than justkicking the can down the road," said Larry Milstein, head ofgovernment and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. in NewYork. "This could make it easier for them to pay their loans." But some investors remained worried about a possible Greekdebt default which could have repercussions across the Europeanbanking sector.  "An extension of the loans for Greece and increasedflexibility for the EFSF to recapitalize institutions takes theheat off the ECB," said Mark McCormick, currency strategist atBrown Brothers Harriman in New York. "It's definitely positivefor the euro. It's not a panacea, but it's a step in the rightdirection." Strong company profit announcements continued to buoy stockprices on global markets, mitigating anxiety over slowingeconomic growth and Washington's wrangling over the need toraise the U.S. statutory $14.3 trillion borrowing limit.
