<raw><![CDATA[ * Bond draws 16 billion euros of demand - banking source * Great majority of bonds allocated to real money investors * No more than 10 percent of bonds placed within Greece * Debt chief aims to near Ireland's spread levels  (updates with book closing) By Alex Chambers and George Georgiopoulos LONDON/ATHENS, March 4 (Reuters) - Greece attracted heavydemand for a sale of 10-year euro benchmark bonds on Thursday,passing a test of market confidence in its fiscal reforms,although it had to offer a high yield on the issue. Petros Christodoulou, head of Greece's PDMA debt agency,told Reuters that Athens now planned to tap the debt market on aregular basis. "Greece is back in the market," he said. [ID:nATH005264] A banking source familiar with the deal said the bonds drewabout 16 billion euros ($22 billion) of demand, and that thefinal pricing indication was mid-swaps plus 300 basis points,tighter than the initial pricing indication of 310 bps. But Christodoulou said Athens would only issue 5.0 billioneuros of the bonds as they were so expensive. Official pricingand issuance details were expected to be announced later. The great majority of the bonds would be allocated to "realmoney accounts", or investors who wanted the debt for investmentrather than for short-term trading or speculation, he said. Greece has blamed hedge funds and other speculators forworsening its debt crisis by pushing yields on its debt upsharply in the past several months. Christodoulou also said no more than 10 percent of the bonddeal was placed within Greece, another sign that foreigninvestors remained willing to buy Greek debt at high yields. On Wednesday, the government announced 4.8 billion euros ofausterity steps for 2010 in an effort to shrink its budgetdeficit; the bond sale was an initial test of whether investorsbelieved the steps could prove effective. [ID:nLDE6220NA]  SPREADS The spread of the 10-year Greek government bond yield over the German Bund yield  widened onlymoderately to 298 bps from 290 bps on Thursday, suggesting themarket was confident of absorbing the new supply of debt. The spread has narrowed sharply from as high as 370 bps lastweek, in anticipation of the austerity measures and in the hopethat rich European Union governments might ultimately extendsome form of financial aid to Greece to ease its debt crisis. Greek bank stocks  rose over 2 percent at onestage on Thursday, although they later pulled back to stand only0.6 percent higher. "The bond sale suggests that the government is able to tapbond markets," said Costas Manolopoulos, a bank analyst at IBG."This could lead to lower bond spreads, which would be good newsfor banks' profitability." Marc Ostwald, analyst at Monument Securities, noted thatGreece was still paying a very high price to raise money, but hesaid the strong demand for the bonds was good news for thesovereign debt of other countries that the market views asrisky, including Argentina, Venezuela and Ukraine. It was Greece's second bond issue in the euro zone debtmarket this year. In late January it raised 8 billion euros witha sale of five-year benchmark bonds, paying a hefty premium of350 bps over mid-swaps and receiving massive investor orders ofabout 25 billion euros.  MORE BONDS Further Greek bond issues are expected to follow in comingmonths. Greece needs to refinance about 20 billion euros of debtmaturing in April and May, and officials previously said itsfunding needs were met until mid-March. Some of the new bonds could be denominated in currenciesother than the euro, such as the dollar; Athens has said it willstage a roadshow for investors in East Asia and the UnitedStates this year, but has not set a firm date. Christodoulou said that as Greece regained credibility amonginvestors, it aimed to become able to issue bonds "at levels notfar wider than Ireland", though he did not give a timeframe. The 10-year yield  for bonds issued by Ireland,which is also heavily indebted but is seen by the market as veryeffective in tackling its budget deficit, was at a spread of 133bps over Bunds on Thursday. For Greece to near that level, it might require an upgradeby credit rating agencies, which have indicated Greece couldstill face a downgrade over the next year if it does not carryout its austerity plan effectively.
