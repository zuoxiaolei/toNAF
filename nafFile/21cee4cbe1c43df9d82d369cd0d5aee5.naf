<raw><![CDATA[   * Singapore Airlines says A380 engines had oil stains * Singapore Airlines: engines changes are "precautionary" * Qantas A380s powered by same Rolls-Royce engines,grounded * Qantas to update on its A380 fleet on Thursday afternoon * Rolls-Royce shares down 7 pct since Qantas enginefailure (Adds Singapore Air not ruling out more engine changes,updates shares) By Harry Suhartono and Balazs Koranyi SINGAPORE/SYDNEY, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Singapore Airlineswill replace engines on three of its Airbus A380 planes afterfinding oil stains on them, almost a week after Australianrival Qantas grounded its A380 fleet due to an engine failure. Qantas's six A380s have been grounded since Thursday, whena Rolls-Royce engine partly disintegrated mid-flight, forcingthe fully laden Airbus to make an emergency landing in thebiggest incident to date for the world's largest passenger jet. Investigations into that incident have focused on oil leaksinside the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, the same model usedto power Singapore Airlines' and German Lufthansa's A380 fleet. But Singapore Airlines stressed the problems on three ofits 11 A380s were precautionary and unrelated as the oil stainswere different from the oil leakage in the Qantas turbines. Singapore's findings may deal a fresh blow to Rolls-Royce,which moved on Monday to contain a crisis of confidence, sayingit was making progress in understanding what caused last week'sblowout on the Qantas A380 flight. "This is a precautionary move to find out what caused theoil stains." a Singapore Airlines spokeswoman said."Rolls-Royce recommended a detailed inspection of the engines." Singapore Airlines said later its other Airbus A380aircraft were still in service, but could not rule out furtherengine changes. "At this stage there is no indication that more engines onour A380 aircraft will need to have precautionary enginechanges carried out, but I would certainly not rule it out,"airline spokeswoman Bryony Duncan-Smith told an Australianradio. INVESTIGATION FOCUSES ON DESIGN FAULT Rolls-Royce shares already lost over 7 percent since theQantas incident, while Airbus and Qantas shares both slipped2.5 percent each. Singapore Airlines shares were littleaffected on Tuesday with the stock down 0.4 percent by 0700GMT. A spokesman for Rolls-Royce declined to comment. Experts said the Qantas investigation is pointing to adesign fault with the engine which may not be difficult to fixbut will take time. "From information provided to date, it would appear to be adesign issue and not a power setting issue. Lower powersettings are not the solution," said Peter Marosszeky, anaviation expert at the University of New South Wales. He added similar engine issues are not unknown to theaviation industry and a fix could be relatively easy, but itcould take some time. "Until then, what could happen is Airbus would allowoperators to fly the A380 on a limited basis with restrictionson the engines," Marosszeky added. However, restriction could be a problem for Qantas, as itsroutes from Los Angeles to Australia are the longest served bythe A380, and lower power limits would mean weightrestrictions, making flights less economical. Sources earlier told Reuters that Qantas is reviewing theway it operates its A380s engines and whether its higher powersettings on take-off contributed to the engine failure. Singapore Airlines' three affected airplanes, scattered inLondon, Melbourne and Sydney, are being flown back to Singaporeto be equipped with similar Rolls-Royce engines. One of the jets took off from Sydney around 0400 GMT whilethe passengers scheduled to be on the airplane are beingtransferred to other flights, a Reuters reporter at the airportsaid. Qantas is expected to give an update on its A380 fleet byThursday afternoon. The airline said on Monday it would groundits six planes for at least 72 hours. "We are still continuing with checks," a Qantas spokesmansaid on Wednesday. On Tuesday, a Boeing 787 test flight made an emergencylanding in Texas with smoke in the cabin, the first incident ofits kind, putting additional scrutiny on the already delayedprogramme.
