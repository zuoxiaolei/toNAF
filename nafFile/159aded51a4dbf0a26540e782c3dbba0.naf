<raw><![CDATA[ * Leaders say everything must be done to try to save A400M * Germany says differences narrowed over "financing" * Source says parties still 2.4 billion euros apart * Further talks offered on loans, inflation link  (Recasts after Berlin meeting) By Sophie Hardach and Dave Graham PARIS/BERLIN, Feb 4 (Reuters) - France and Germany calledfor urgent solutions to a funding crisis over Europe's biggestmilitary project, the A400M troop plane, but talks on Thursdaybetween Airbus and NATO nations failed to agree a quick bailout. Technical problems have pushed the 20 billion euro ($27.75billion) project four years behind schedule and 11.2 billioneuros over budget, threatening up to 10,000 jobs and sparkingtesty exchanges between the leading buyer Germany and Airbus. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German ChancellorAngela Merkel spoke out following a summit in Paris, but stoppedshort of a formal declaration as gaps remained among negotiatorsat seven-nation talks in Berlin. "Everything must be done to reach a solution. It is adecisive project which must be resolved very quickly," FrenchPresident Nicolas Sarkozy said at a joint news conference afterthe Franco-German summit. "With regards to the A400M project, I think that thenegotiations should be continued, and we agreed that this is aproject of strategic significance, and that everything should bedone to find a solution," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. The A400M is designed to put soldiers and heavy equipment inrugged combat zones like Afghanistan, and some backers see it asa prop to Europe's efforts to forge its own defence identity. Other buyers of the plane are Britain, Belgium, Luxembourg,Spain and Turkey. As Sarkozy and Merkel met, Airbus owner EADS resumed talkswith European government buyers in Berlin in a frantic bid toprevent the soaring costs killing off the project. The group faces major A400M provisions in its 2009 earningsand an industry source said a quick solution was needed by thecompany's auditors. EADS declined official comment. EADS has appealed to the buyers for extra support to startfull production of the plane, which first flew in December. Butgovernments are unwilling to let taxpayers foot the whole bill.  2.4 BILLION EURO GAP A German defence spokesman said Berlin talks had narroweddifferences over financing, but did not say whether thisreferred to loans that are part of the discussion. "There was anarrowing of positions on the subject of financing," he said. "The buyer nations and EADS agreed to continue talks overthe remaining gap as quickly as possible," he added. However a person familiar with the matter said the two campshad failed to bridge a 2.4 billion euro gap in core demands. Talks broke off last week after EADS sought 4.4 billioneuros to keep the project afloat while buyers offered 2 billion. In Berlin on Thursday, buyers "confirmed the 2 billion eurooffer and (are) ready to discuss other financing options,"according to the person familiar with the matter, who spoke oncondition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks. Nations offered EADS talks on a package of credits or loansbut no concrete proposal, the person said. They also offered talks to address an inflation formulawhich EADS has been pressing buyers to adjust. EADS shares fell more than 2 percent to 14.25 euros. Airbus recently threatened to shut down the A400M if a dealcould not be reached soon, risking a major confrontation withcountries that call most of the political shots at EADS. EADS is controlled jointly by French and German interestsand the French and Spanish governments directly own stakes. Germany's defence minister, who has taken a harder line thanmost on the row, warned the firm against overplaying its hand. "There is a contract and we have an interest in not allowingourselves to be pressured unduly," Karl-Theodor zu Guttenbergtold reporters in Paris after the Franco-German summit. Guttenberg was speaking before heading off to Istanbul for ameeting of NATO defence ministers, part of a flurry of meetingsbeing held across Europe that could determine the A400M's fate. U.S. rival Lockheed Martin has said it expects to sell moreC-130J Hercules planes due to A400M delays and analysts say acollapse could also benefit Boeing, whose larger C-17jet-powered transporter faces a U.S. budget threat.
