<raw><![CDATA[ (Repeats to fix table) * Fed Chairman Bernanke sees case for more policy easing * Aussie dollar rises above parity for 1st time since 1983 * Euro retreats from 8-1/2-month high; dips below $1.40  (Updates prices, adds quote, details) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose from a more thaneight-month low against the euro on Friday as traders said its recent declineswere overdone, but a sustained rebound seemed unlikely given expectations offurther monetary easing. The Australian dollar  earlier surged above parity against thegreenback for the first time since flotation in 1983 after Federal ReserveChairman Ben Bernanke said there was a case for more easing given low inflationand high unemployment. It later retreated as profit-taking kicked in. Analysts said the dollar is likely to stay on the defensive until the Fed'sNov. 2-3 meeting. The downside may be limited,  however, as much of the impactfrom additional Fed asset purchases has been priced into the market and bearishsentiment on the dollar has reached extreme levels. "The dollar is somewhat oversold against a number of its key counterparts,but I don't really see much scope for sustained dollar gains ahead of the Fedmeeting in November," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at CommonwealthForeign Exchange Inc in Washington. The euro fell as low as $1.3971 on trading platform EBS  and lasttraded at $1.3986, down 0.65 percent on the day. The euro had earlier climbedas high as $1.4161 -- its strongest level since Jan. 26. Upside targets for the euro include a late January high at $1.4195 and then$1.4374, the 76.4 percent retracement of the euro's slide from its November2009 peak down to a trough hit in June. The dollar index , which tracks the greenback against a basket of sixcurrencies, was up 0.3 percent at 76.490, after falling as low as 76.144, theweakest in 10 months. Weakness in the U.S. currency pushed the Australian dollar above theone-to-one level earlier on Friday for the first time since the Aussie wasfloated in 1983.

RISK OF DISAPPOINTMENT Bernanke gave no details on the central bank's next step but saidpolicymakers were still weighing how aggressive they should be. He alsosuggested the Fed could indicate a willingness to hold interest rates low forlonger than currently expected. [ID:nLDE69E1ST] "The crux of the issue now is how big ... the initial phase of QE2 wouldbe," said Mike Moran, senior currency strategist at Standard Chartered in NewYork. "The actual size could be open-ended. In that sense, I think there is somerisk of disappointment in terms of how much information we're likely to getfrom the Fed when they do announce the second round of QE," he added. Analysts said the dollar could see a rebound if the Fed announces assetpurchases of less than $1 trillion or takes a more gradual approach after itsNovember meeting, which would disappoint some market participants hoping foraction to ease concerns about a debasement of the dollar. The dollar could also rise after the Fed meeting in a "sell the rumor, buythe fact" reaction, traders said. Declines in some major U.S. stock indexes also hit investors risk appetiteand provided some safe-haven demand for the dollar, analysts said. The dollar dipped 0.1 percent to 81.37 yen . It hit a 15-year low of80.88 yen on Thursday, only about 1 yen above its record low of 79.75 yen setin April 1995, keeping the market nervous about the possibility of moreJapanese intervention following a first round in mid-September. The U.S. Treasury Department has decided to delay a much-anticipated reportabout whether to label China or any other foreign country a currencymanipulator, a Senate aide said on Friday. We are "hearing they will delay its release," the Senate aide said,speaking on condition he not be identified.[ID:nWBT014198] The U.S. administration faces a tough call on whether to label China acurrency manipulator, a move that could throw a wrench in Sino-U.S. relations.             ]]></raw>
