<raw><![CDATA[ * Trade powers differ over how much needed to finish Doha * Doha deal would be insurance against protectionism  (Recasts with comments from ambassadors, Lamy) By Jonathan Lynn GENEVA, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Major trade powers sparred onTuesday over what needed to be done to finish the long-runningDoha round amid a flurry of recent activity to revive thestalled talks. Ambassadors to the World Trade Organization from Brazil,China, the European Union, India and the United States agreedthat much valuable work had already been done on Doha. But they disagreed whether a lot or a little was needed tofinish the talks, launched nine years ago this month to openglobal commerce and help developing countries prosper throughmore trade. All restated long-standing positions, indicating how hard itwill be to break out of the current impasse, but also suggestingthey were readying for a final round of bargaining. "They're just positioning themselves. They're marking outterritory," said one senior trade official.     The ambassadors, speaking at a WTO workshop on theimpact of the Doha round, all agreed that give and take on allsides was needed to finish the job. Discussions by key WTO ambassadors in recent months tobrainstorm on Doha have brought a sense of movement to thetalks, stuck since a meeting of ministers in July 2008 brokeapart over differences over the core areas of farming andmanufacturing. WTO officials and negotiators hope that leaders of the G20will reinvigorate the talks when they discuss trade over lunchat the G20 summit in Seoul on Nov. 12. The main features of a Doha deal would be a cut indistorting farm subsidies by rich countries to end tradedistortions that hurt developing nations, while emergingeconomies would open up their markets for industrial goods. Allwould liberalise services such as telecoms and banking, whichnow account for the bulk of economic activity in most states.  VARYING ESTIMATES Estimates of the value of a deal like that vary widely, andthe WTO workshop brought together leading trade economists todiscuss the analyses. Relatively modest forecasts of a boost to the global economyof $50 billion a year from opening up farming and manufacturingcould be improved significantly with more ambitious negotiationsand liberalisation of services. But the main benefit from a Doha deal could be locking incuts in tariffs that countries have undertaken unilaterally,preventing protectionist backsliding and providing businesseswith certainty for their investments, they found. In any case, EU ambassador John Clarke said EU member statesand the European Parliament would make a hard-headed politicalassessment of whether a deal created opportunities in differentsectors, and created fairer conditions for developing countries,rather than looking at macro-economic studies. Chinese ambassador Sun Zhenyu said China, which joined theWTO when Doha was launched, was not pushing for any particularconcessions in the talks, but would benefit from a strengtheningof the global trading system, and warned that the round was notprimarily about opening markets for rich countries.  The fact that businessmen were now coming to Geneva todiscuss the talks with negotiators was a sign of hope, he said. "People are talking about a possible window in 2011," hesaid. U.S. ambassador Michael Punke said what had been achievedwas not insignificant -- but nor was it sufficient, reiteratingWashington's call for big emerging economies to do more to opentheir markets. "For us, what is very clear is the pain and what is not soclear is the gain," he said, encapsulating a view voiced by mostof the others, but which WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy saidwas a classical negotiating stance. Ultimately the fate of the Doha round will depend on whatthe United States agrees with China and the other big emergingcountries, although China and the United States have not so fargot down to serious bilateral talks, diplomats said. Brazil had nothing to gain from the industrial goods talks,and the proposals in farming were still disappointing for theworld's agriculture superpower, ambassador Roberto Azevedo said. "In agriculture we're not convinced we're getting a lot butwe're moving in the right direction," he said. (Editing by Charles Dick)             ]]></raw>
