<raw><![CDATA[ (Updates throughout with comments, background) By Tabassum Zakaria WASHINGTON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - China and the United Statesdo not want a dispute over tires to spark a broader trade war,U.S. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg said onThursday. Steinberg will visit China on Monday and Tuesday during atrip to Asia that will also include stops in Vietnam, Malaysia,South Korea, and Japan. In a speech to the Center for a New American Security, hesaid the U.S. decision to impose a tariff on tire imports fromChina had been taken under terms of a World Trade Organizationframework accepted by both the United States and China. Beijing condemned the U.S. decision for a 35-percentadditional "safeguard" tariff on tire imports from China asprotectionism that could undermine a global economic recovery.It is concerned the safeguard rule could also be used againstother products. Steinberg said both countries wanted to make sure "thatthis particular disagreement does not spark a trade war." President Barack Obama sought to ease friction in a meetingwith China's President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the U.N.General Assembly in New York this week, a U.S. official said. The two will meet again at the G20 economic summit inPittsburgh this week. Obama plans to visit China in November. Some economists believe imbalances between export-driveneconomies like China and consumption-driven economies like theUnited States helped set the stage for the recent globalfinancial crisis. Steinberg said that without the United States and Chinaworking together, "the prospect of (economic) success would bemuch dimmer." (Editing by Alan Elsner)             ]]></raw>
