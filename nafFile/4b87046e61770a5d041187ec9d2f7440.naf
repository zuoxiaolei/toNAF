While the dollar initially fell against the euro also, itlater recovered after Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Junckersaid he was not happy with the euro's move to $1.4000. The euroclimbed above $1.4000 on Thursday. "The overall change (in payrolls) is really bad and isprobably enough to convince the Fed to engage in quantitativeeasing," said Mark Mccormick, currency strategist at BrownBrothers Harriman in New York. "Most are pricing in some $500billion of easing, and I don't think this really changes that.I think the Fed still intervenes." The dollar was last at 82.00 yen on electronic tradingplatform EBS  , down 0.4 percent on the day,after falling as low as 81.93 yen. Investors remained on full alert for intervention by theBank of Japan to weaken the yen given it is trading at levelsstronger than the 82.87 level where the central bank stepped inon September 15. "There was no sign of the Bank of Japan in the market yet,but there's strong support below the 82 yen level and Iwouldn't be surprised to see it bounce if it dips below 82again today," said Greg Salvaggio, vice president for trading,Tempus Consulting in Washington. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Japan would takedecisive steps on the strong yen if needed but added it alsowanted to cooperate with the G7 and other countries.[ID:nTOE69700W] EURO FALL Investors are also wary in case the G7 and IMF meetingsstarting in Washington on Friday produce a surprise in the formof a coordinated front on currencies, as calls have mounted forglobal efforts to avoid competitive currency devaluations. The euro was last down 0.1 percent against the dollar at$1.3916   on EBS. The euro exchange rate against the dollar is too strong at$1.40, as the dollar does not reflect the economic fundamentalsof the United States, Juncker said on Friday ahead ofthemeeting of finance ministers and central bankers of theGroup of Seven most industrialised countries. . "The euro is too strong today," Juncker told a meeting inWashington ahead of a meeting of finance ministers and centralbankers of the Group of Seven most industrialised countries. "Juncker has turned the market with comments about how he'snot happy with the euro reaching $1.40,' said Michael Woolfolk,senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in New York. "Thisadds to concern about competitive devaluations, particularlysince foreign exchange will be discussed at official IMFmeeting this weekend." But foreign exchange markets remained volatile.    St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard, a voting member thisyear on the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee, toldCNBC that policymakers face a tough decision at next month'spolicy meeting as the economy has slowed but is still bumpingalong. [ID:nN08192815] Market speculation the Fed will resume quantitative easingwhen it meets on Nov. 2-3 to shore up the economy hasincreased. But Bullard did not rule this out, saying more help frompolicy may be needed to push up inflation. The dollar index, a non-traded calculation of the dollar'sperformance against a basket of six other major currencies, wasup 0.1 percent at 77.422 , moving above an 8-1/2 monthlow of 76.906 touched on Thursday.
