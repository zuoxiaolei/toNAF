<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar falls to 14-month low vs euro, forex basket, Aussie * Dollar hits 15-month lows vs Canada, NZ, Swiss franc * Aussie boosted by RBA Stevens' hawkish comments * Dovish FOMC minutes weigh on dollar  (changes dateline, byline, writes through, previous TOKYO) By Tamawa Desai LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to multi-monthlows against the euro and commodity-based currencies aspolicymaker comments reinforced expectations U.S. interest rateswould stay lower for longer than those of other major countries. The greenback hit 14-month lows against the euro and thehigher-yielding Australian dollar and a 15-month trough versusthe New Zealand and Canada dollars. It also touched a three-week low against sterling after aBank of England policymaker said its quantitative easingprogramme was working. Expectations U.S. interest rates would remain low for sometime were reinforced by minutes from the latest meeting of theU.S. Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee and gave tradersa green light to sell the dollar. Meanwhile risk sentiment was buoyed by forecast-beatingearnings from JPMorgan and Intel Corp this week, boostingequities and dimming the dollar's appeal.  More earnings are due out on Thursday, with traders focusingon Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. European share prices opened higher after gains in Asia andon Wall Street."Firmer equity markets and lower risk aversion continue todepress the dollar," said Adam Cole, global head of FX strategyat RBC Capital Markets. The euro hit a 14-month high of $1.4967, according toReuters data, with technical analysts eyeing a break above $1.5,but some cited caution. At 0738 GMT, it was up 0.1 percent at$1.4940. Sources close to the Eurogroup of euro zone financeministers said on Wednesday they would discuss exchange rates atmeeting on Monday, with concern more likely about thepossibility of the euro's further rise than about currentlevels. European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet speaksat a conference later in the day, and "forex markets obviously(are) attuned to any mention of euro strength as a cause forconcern," RBC's Cole said. Some traders said the euro's strength was aided by emergingeconomies' central banks seeking to diversify their foreignreserves. The banks have been buying dollars to prevent theirown currencies from rising sharply but some are selling thegreenback in favour of the euro, the traders said. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of thegreenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, wasdown 0.2 percent at 75.332 after falling to a 14-month low of75.211. The dollar was under pressure after minutes of the latestFederal Open Market Committee meeting showed some policymakerscalled for increasing asset purchases, underscoring views theFed would not be raising rates any time soon. "The dollar was hit by surprisingly dovish FOMC minutes," UBS analysts said in a note. "The minutes clearly indicate theFOMC is a long way from tightening and balance sheet reductiondoes not appear to be a policy priority either." That was in sharp contrast to comments by Reserve Bank ofAustralia chief Glenn Stevens, who said local interest rateswould need to move towards a more normal setting as economicrecovery took hold, reinforcing the view rates would be hikedfor a second consecutive month in November. The Aussie rose as high as $0.9228 on the Reuters dealingsystem, its highest since August 2008, before trading at $0.9209, up 0.6 percent from late New York trade. The kiwi touched a 15-month high of $0.7487, afterstronger-than-expected inflation numbers raised expectations ofa near-term interest rate hike. The Canadian dollar, another currency linked to commodities,hit a 15-month high against the dollar of C$1.0207. The dollar's broad fall also extended to the Swiss franc,which hit a 15-month peak of 1.0117 franc, while sterling hit athree-week high against the dollar. Bank of England policymaker Paul Fisher told the Financial Times he felt more confident the central bank's asset purchaseprogramme was "having the scale and speed of impact that wewould have hoped for when we started (in March)". U.S. consumer prices and jobless claims data will be watchedfor any further signs of recovery. The dollar held steady against the yen above 89 yen.Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii repeated that countriesmust not compete in devaluing their currencies.
