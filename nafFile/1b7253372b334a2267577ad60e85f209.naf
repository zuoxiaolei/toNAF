<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro recovers after Irish bank announcement * Dollar/yen drops to 15-year low * Euro extends all-time low versus Swiss franc * Little euro chart support until 1.2700 vs Swiss franc (Adds quote, details, updates prices) By Nick Olivari NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The euro recovered from lossesand rose against the dollar and the yen on Wednesday afterIreland's finance ministry said nationalized lender Anglo IrishBank will be split into a funding bank and an asset recoverybank to wind down its assets.  Earlier, the yen struck a 15-year high against the dollarand the Swiss franc hit an all-time peak versus the euro asconcerns about euro zone banks and sovereign debt prompted aflight to safety. While the rally in the yen and franc eased as the New Yorksession got under way, with the euro climbing to a sessionpeak, analysts cautioned that overall risk aversion wasintact. Concerns about how Ireland dealt with the troubled AngloIrish Bank and Germany's announcement that it will not back aeuro rescue fund forever highlighted problems in weak euro zonecountries and had weighed on risky assets."Just the (Irish) announcement bought a little relief rally"in the euro, said John McCarthy, director of foreign exchangetrading at ING Capital Markets in New York. "But people arelooking to sell the euros in substantial rallies as issues suchas sovereign debt in the euro zone have not gone away."  The euro was up 0.5 percent at $1.2746, trading between apeak of $1.2762 and a low of $1.2660 earlier.   The euro rose 0.7 percent to 107.00 yen, after earlierthreatening to revisit August's nine-year low just below105.50. YEN WATCH Earlier in the global trading day, persistent buying byinvestors seeking a temporary refuge in the yen helped push thegreenback through a major option trigger below 83.50 yen, againtesting the Japanese authorities' pain threshold for strengthin their currency. "Not surprisingly, more rhetoric from Japanese policymakershas been unleashed, though the legitimacy of such talk is stillin question until we see some actual action," said SachaTihanyi, currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa reiterated hisreluctance to return to quantitative easing although heindicated the central bank was weighing its options. FinanceMinister Yoshihiko Noda again warned he would take decisiveaction if necessary. "The growth and changing nature of FX since the Japaneselast intervened should dampen their hopes for now. The speed ofthe move will be the cue ... My fresh target for dollar/yen isnow 79.50 and for euro/yen 104.50," a London trader said.  The dollar fell as low as 83.34 yen on electronic tradingplatform EBS and 83.35 on Reuters data, its cheapest since1995, when it struck an all-time low of 79.75. It later recovered to 84.00 yen, up 0.2 percent on theday. SWISS FRANC IN DEMAND The euro is still below a three-week high of $1.2920 hit onMonday on EBS, pressured after a newspaper report Tuesdayreignited concerns about European sovereign debt and banks'exposure. Adding to these worries was German Chancellor AngelaMerkel's comment on Tuesday that Berlin will not supportprolonging rescue mechanisms to underpin the euro indefinitelybecause it would damage the single currency.       The euro'slosses were limited as it found support at the 100-day simplemoving average around $1.2670. Technical analysts saw the nextsupport at $1.2605, the 50 percent retracement of the euro'sMay-to-August rally. Analysts said a significant move below $1.27 required freshdownward impetus. "We've had a lot of negative chatter (about euro zonebanks) in the past few days, but no new, concrete news," saidPeter Frank, currency analyst at Societe Generale in London. "For the euro to keep weakening, we need confirmation ofbad news, not just chatter from the local press," he said,adding the next big risk for the euro was Hungary, which mustfind a way to plug a gaping hole in its 2010 budget.. The euro fell to a record low versus the Swiss franc of1.2765 francs on EBS after taking out the previous day's recordlow and traders saw little chart support until 1.2700. Therecord low on Reuters data was 1.2766. The dollar fell to a nine-month low on EBS of 1.0060francs. The daily low on Reuters data was 1.0063 francs. The euro was last up 0.6 percent at 1.2906 francs and thedollar up 0.1 percent at 1.0124 francs. Elsewhere the Bank of Canada raised its key interest rateby 25 basis points to 1 percent as expected but said a weakU.S. economy would hamper Canada's recovery.. The U.S. dollar was last down 1 percent at C$1.0371. (Additional reporting by Neal Armstrong in London; Editing byAndrea Ricci)             ]]></raw>
