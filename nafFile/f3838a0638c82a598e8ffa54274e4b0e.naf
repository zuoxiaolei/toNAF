<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro shot up against the yen on Monday after the pro-bailout New Democracy political party came out ahead in Sunday's parliamentary elections in Greece, easing fears Greeks favor ditching the euro.In Asian trading on Monday, EUR/JPY hit 100.67, up 1.15%, up from a low of 100.11 and off a high of 100.85.The pair sought to test support at 99.30, the low of June 13, and resistance at 100.85, the earlier high.Greek voters, though weary from austerity measures attached to rescue funding, appear willing to stick with the euro.Abandoning the euro would arguably involve a messy default, which would have roiled markets worldwide.New Democracy edged out the leftist Syriza, which favored scrapping austerity measures tied to bailout money.Past Greek administrations agreed to austerity measures such as layoffs and spending cuts in exchange for bailout aid, and scrapping austerity threatened to halt the flow of rescue funding and could have opened the door to a Greek exit of the currency union.New Democracy politicians favor sticking with the bailout, though they have said the country needs more growth-oriented policies going forward.Leaders across Europe have complained that austerity policies have cut into growth rates and have exacerbated economic downturns.New Democracy and PASOK, another pro-bailout party, appeared on track to garner enough votes at the time of writing to push through a coalition government in favor of sticking with the bailout.The euro, meanwhile, was up against the pound and up against the Canadian dollar, with EUR/GBP trading up 0.42%Â  at 0.8082 and EUR/CAD up 0.27% and trading at 1.2949.Markets will continue to digest the outcome of the Greek elections on Monday.The Bank of Japan is due to release its monthly report, which contains the statistical data that policymakers evaluate when setting interest rates.On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve begins its monetary policy meeting.              ]]></raw>
