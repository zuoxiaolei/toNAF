<raw><![CDATA[ By Natsuko Waki LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Investors may be forced torethink investment strategies that centre on the rosy prospectof low inflation as key central banks look set to renew pledgesto print money in the coming week. Outperformance of developed market assets relative to theiroversubscribed emerging counterparts this year partly reflects asentiment shift for investors, who are becoming uneasy aboutinflation in the rapidly growing developing world and an as-yetmuted policy response. Price pressures are becoming increasingly observable even indeveloped economies. UK inflation hit an 8-month high of 3.7percent last month, prompting investors to price in a rate hikeby mid-year. Higher energy prices have pushed euro zone inflation to 2.2percent, above the European Central Bank's 2 percent target. But there's nothing to suggest these central banks willtighten monetary conditions aggressively.  The Fed and Bank of Japan are expected to stick to theirquantitative easing policies when they meet in the coming weekwhile the Bank of England minutes are likely to reveal no changein its promise to keep its asset purchasing programme onstandby. Even the ECB, whose President Jean-Claude Trichet has warnedof price pressures, is unlikely to raise rates immediately. However, further price pressures may challenge the investorperception interest rates would remain at current low levels fora foreseeable future -- which could in turn hit equities. "You don't have runaway inflation expectations. No oneexpects the ECB to be very aggressive. With this golden periodof no interest rate rises, investors have no choice but to buyrisky assets, exactly what central banks are engineering us todo," said Gary Baker, head of European equity strategy at BofAMerrill Lynch. "But if there were anything to challenge the U.S... ratesoutlook, that may be a signal to start to get cautious onpositions." A net 72 percent of fund managers polled by BofA MerrillLynch this month expected higher inflation in the next 12months, the highest reading in almost 5 years.  At the same time, they have pushed back expectations for thefirst Federal Reserve rate rise well into 2012. DM SURPRISE World stocks on a MSCI measure have risen more than 1percent so far this year, adding to their gain of 10 percentlast year. Their emerging market counterparts lost 1.3 percent,having risen 16 percent in 2010.  The emerging MSCI index was on track for its biggest weeklydrop in nearly two months in the past week. "2010 was the story of EM doing well and it will continue todo well, but a surprise in 2011 will be major economies pickingup," said Thanos Papasavvas, head of currency management atInvestec. He expects the ECB, BoE and Fed to raise rates this year. "With world growth picking up and commodity prices rising,inflationary pressures will surprise to the upside, we'realready seeing signs of that. They will start raising rates." Stocks in India and Indonesia have come under pressure inrecent sessions as investors grew concerned that monetaryauthorities may be behind the curve in tackling inflation. In Turkey, which shocked markets by cutting interest rateson Thursday, concerns about inflation pushed benchmark yields to their highest level since early December over the past week.Local stocks fell nearly two percent this month, underperformingthe benchmark MSCI emerging index.The BofA survey showed investors are trimming EM risks as arise in inflation became a headwind for equities. Respondents sharply cut their overweight positions onemerging economies to a net 43 percent from 56 percent inDecember, although the region remained as the most popular. At the same time, they turned most positive on U.S. equitiessince late 2008 with a net 27 percent of respondents overweight. Going forward, outperformance of U.S. and other developedmarkets may have further to run as investors will regardinflationary pressures in developed economies -- as long as theystay mild -- as incentives to buy risky assets with cheapvaluations. "The pattern of performance across markets... suggests ithas been driven by a clear and substantial upgrade to U.S.growth prospects," Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients. "Globally, our core view is more positive in 2011 than in2010, with accelerating U.S. and global growth through the yearand -- at the global level at least -- a still-easy policystance."
