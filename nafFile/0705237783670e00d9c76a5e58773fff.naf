<raw><![CDATA[ * Central banks bought 7.7 T of gold in Q2, WGC says * Asian central banks seen adding further to reserves  (Adds background, comment) By Jan Harvey LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Central banks are expected to benet buyers of gold in 2011 for the first time in nearly twodecades, the World Gold Council said on Thursday. "For next year, we will probably see a scenario wherecentral banks are net buyers (of gold) for the first time insomething like 17 years," Marcus Grubb, the WGC's managingdirector for investment, told delegates at the World GoldInvestment Congress in London. He said central banks had been net buyers of 7.7 tonnes ofgold in the second quarter of 2010. Before 2009, they were netsellers of an average of 400 tonnes per year. Gold prices hit a record high above $1,360 an ounce onThursday, driven by weakness in the dollar, which stemmed fromgrowing expectations for the Federal Reserve to keep U.S.interest rates low to support economic growth. The prices have risen by more than 20 percent so far thisyear, supported in part by central bank moves to becomeaggregate buyers of gold. A trend has emerged for some central banks in Asia -- mostrecently Thailand and Bangladesh -- to add to their goldreserves. "We have lots of central banks in Asia that have tinyweightings of gold," Grubb said. He said Asia currently holds only 2.4 percent of its foreignexchange reserves in gold. Raising this by 1 percent of reserveswould necessitate the acquisition of 850 tonnes of gold, hesaid. Meanwhile, central banks in Europe, where much of thecurrent official holdings are concentrated, in recent years havecut back heavily on sales. Grubb said he saw strength in gold prices persisting asuncertainty over the global economic outlook continued tounsettle investors, saying the rise in prices was backed up byfirm demand from major markets India and China.
