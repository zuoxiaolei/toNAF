<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar reverses declines, moves higher after data * Euro reverses gains with investors wary of EZ debt * EU summit not seen offering solution to debt crisis * Spanish bond auction produces solid demand, higher yields (Recasts; adds quote, details, updates prices) NEW YORK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The dollar reversed earlierdeclines to rally against the euro and yen on Thursday amidrising bond yields after a report unexpectedly showed factoryactivity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region rose in December. U.S. Treasury prices posted fresh session lows after thereport suggested an acceleration in economic growth and  theyield on the benchmark 10-year note touched a session high of3.56 percent, up from 3.52 percent on Wednesday. "The data turned Treasuries around and as U.S. rates backedup the dollar went with them," said Brian Dolan, chiefstrategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. The euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.3196 after sliding morethan 1 percent on Wednesday. The dollar had gained earlier this week as benchmark10-year Treasury yields hit seven-month highs, pushing thedollar to a three-month peak against the yen at 84.51 yen onWednesday. The dollar was up 0.2 percent against the yen at84.36 yen on Thursday. Yields stayed near those seven-month highs on Thursdayafter the European Central Bank said it will double itssubscribed capital due to increased market volatility andcredit risk. Yet investors cautioned that higher bond yields may workagainst the dollar in the longer term. "Who wants to own a Treasury as yields rise?" said ChuckButler, president of EverBank World Markets in St. Louis. "It'sa short-term blip for the dollar." While a further rise in U.S. bond yields was seen helpingthe dollar for now, some market players noted a breakdown inthe dollar/yen's correlation with U.S. bond yields and withU.S.-Japan yield spreads. "It's too early to say with conviction, but it could be dueto an emergence of bearish factors, such as the U.S. fiscalsituation," said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist atRabobank. EU SUMMIT The euro had been up on Thursday as a European Union summitto discuss the debt crisis got underway, but investors hadalready cautioned the currency was vulnerable to a sell-off onlingering euro zone peripheral debt concerns. European leaders sought to paper over deep divisions on howbest to resolve the debt crisis ahead of their summit, butSpain and Portugal came under renewed pressure to get theirfinances in order. Euro zone policymakers are discussing ideas to fall back onif moves to create a permanent European Stability Mechanism forsolving debt crises fail to calm markets. While the summit statement is expected on Friday, investorsare looking for any comments that may be made separately bythose attending the meeting. "They are showing no signs of breaking the impasse," saidForex.com's Dolan. "Germany is resisting the expansion of thebailout facility and pushing it on the ECB, and as long as thathappens, the final long-term debt default resolution mechanismis not in sight." Traders said liquidity was showing signs of drying up asthe year end was approaching and this was likely to increasethe potential for sharp moves. The euro hit the day's highs after results from an auctionof Spanish 10- and 15-year bonds on Thursday, a day afterratings agency Moody's said it could downgrade Spain's ratings.The auction resulted in higher yields, but solid bid-to-coverratios. "Spain is not in a situation where it would have troubleservicing its debt, so the auction saw enough demand," saidLutz Karpowitz, senior currency strategist at Commerzbank inFrankfurt. But others added the higher yields indicated continuedwariness about euro zone debt. Government debt yields for Spain, Portugal and Italy roseafter the Spanish bond auction, highlighting thoseconcerns.             ]]></raw>
