<raw><![CDATA[ * Dlr/yen rises as high as Y94.78 on EBS, then eases * Traders take profits from dollar gains * Traders eye reopening of NY stock market, Fed board meeting By Satomi Noguchi TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - The dollar eased against the yenon Monday with traders pocketing profits after the greenbackvaulted to its highest in more than seven months earlier in theday. In holiday-thinned early Asian trade, the dollar rose to nearthe 95 yen mark, adding to a 2.8 percent climb last week, aftergenerally upbeat jobs data indicated the U.S. economic recoveryis on a solid footing. But traders said speculators trimmed yen shorts after havingturned their positions against the yen aggressively, providing afloor for the Japanese currency which had earlier hit a 10-weeklow against the euro and a 18-month trough versus the Australiandollar. Still, overall trading remained subdued with markets inAustralia, New Zealand and China closed for holidays. "After breaking decisively above the January high of 93.78yen and other strong chart resistance, technically dollar/yen isclearly in a bullish trend," said Minoru Shioiri, chief managerof foreign exchange trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. "But for many players the dollar looks too high to bet moreon the currency, unless you are a medium-term trader expecting itto rise to 100 yen," he said. The dollar earlier rose as high as 94.78 yen on tradingplatform EBS, the highest since late August 2009, before easingto 94.38 yen, down about 0.2 percent from midday trading in NewYork on Friday. Analysts said the dollar is likely to find new resistancearound 95.10 yen -- a 61.8 percent retracement of its fall from ahigh in April 2009 of 101.45 to a 14-year low of 84.82 yen hit inlate November. Traders said rises in long-term Treasury yields after thejobs report, with the benchmark 10-year yield climbing to anine-month high near 4 percent, also boosted the dollar's yieldappeal compared with the low-yielding yen. A solid rise in private-sector hiring in the jobs report hasled traders to believe the Federal Reserve may raise the discountrate again on Monday when it holds a meeting, providing supportto the dollar. Many analysts downplayed the significance of the upcoming Fedboard meeting since it is held every other Monday and is not theclosely watched Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Butit stirred chatter of another increase in the discount rate, orthe emergency rate at which it lends to banks. On Feb. 18, the Fed surprised the market when it hiked thediscount rate by a quarter point to 0.75 percent. Markets in the UK and many euro zone countries are also onholiday. The U.S. stock market will reopen after closing on Friday forthe Good Friday holiday. "The dollar looks already high enough against the yen to takeprofits," said a senior trader at a Japanese bank. "But the currency's strength since Friday without a majorcorrective move down suggests that it may stay on a firm footingat least until the market sees the result of the Fed meetingtoday," the trader said. The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performanceagainst six other major currencies, stood at 81.014, off Friday'shigh of 81.324 when it rose about 0.8 percent. The euro rose to $1.3523, up from $1.3476 in midday tradinghours in U.S. on Friday when it fell about 0.7 percent. The euro was steady at 127.65 yen after reaching as high as127.93 yen earlier on EBS, the highest since Jan. 26. The Australian dollar advanced as far as around 87.10 yen,according to Reuters data, the highest since late September 2008,before retreating to 86.91 yen.
