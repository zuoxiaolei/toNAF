<raw><![CDATA[ * US dollar under pressure as risk appetite increases    * Euro trades at fresh 2009 high * Higher yielding currencies rise (Adds comments, details. Updates prices.) By Vivianne Rodrigues NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell again onWednesday, touching new lows for 2009 against major currencies,as investors moved to riskier assets like stocks andhigher-yielding currencies.   The ongoing rally in European and U.S. stocks has supportedhopes for economic recovery, and together with the drop in U.S.dollar borrowing costs, has encouraged investors to look forhigher returns around the world. Renewed concerns over the dollar's long-term status as theworld's reserve currency and options-related euro buying alsocontributed to sell-off which started on Tuesday.    "The dollar trade is ultimately a risk trade. That is, asrisk appetite improves, the dollar gets hurt," said BorisSchlossberg, a director for currency research at GFT Forex inNew York. "The move lower started once a key technical barrier oneuro/dollar was lifted late on Friday," he added. "Largeoptions contracts expired and that enabled traders to push theeuro through $1.45 and now the target is $1.46. The rise instocks and commodities, is contributing to the move."  The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.4570  after brieflytouching $1.4593, a fresh 2009 high, according to Reutersdata. UBS analysts cut forecasts for the dollar, saying in a notethat they raised their 1-month euro/dollar forecast to $1.45from $1.40 and 3-month forecast to $1.35 from $1.30. Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.7 percent to 91.68 yen, near a seven-month low.   "The combination of risk seeking U.S. investorsdiversifying their portfolios and equities rallying furtherwill keep the dollar weak near term," said Geoffrey Yu, acurrency strategist at UBS AG.  The dollar index , which tracks the performance ofthe greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies,fell 0.6 percent to 76.86. It touched 76.810 earlier, itslowest since late September 2008. (Reporting by Vivianne Rodrigues)             ]]></raw>
