<raw><![CDATA[ * Sterling gains on housing, GDP data * Euro gives up gains on profit-taking, fiscal concerns * U.S. consumer confidence rises, USD/JPY gains (Adds details, updates prices, changes byline)By Steven C. Johnson and Vivianne RodriguesNEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - Sterling rose on Tuesday asdata showed the UK economy growing a bit more swiftly thanexpected while the dollar neared a three-month high against theyen after U.S. data showed consumer confidence grew in March.The euro continued to struggle, falling sharply against thedollar as investors took profits after two days of gains and asunease persisted about the euro zone's fiscal health.The dollar rose above 93 yen for the first time since earlyJanuary as strong consumer confidence data bolstered views thatthe Federal Reserve will raise interest rates sooner than itsJapanese or European counterparts. It was last up 0.4 percent at 92.80 yen . "The U.S. economy keeps getting better while Japan is stillin deflation, and with the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield knockingon 4 percent, the interest rate differential is pushing thedollar up," said Hidetoshi Yanagihara, senior currency traderat Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York. He said the dollar couldreach 95 yen in the second quarter, which begins on Thursday. The British pound was on track for its best day against thegreenback in nearly two weeks after revised GDP data showed theeconomy grew 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter. Separate datashowed UK house prices rose in March. [ID:nLAG006193]In afternoon trading, the pound rose 0.7 percent to $1.5082 while the euro was changing hands at 89.02 pence, down 1percent .The euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.3416  and shed 0.5percent to 124.48 yen . Earlier, it hit 125.44 yen,its highest level since early February. Analysts say that if U.S. non-farm payrolls data due Fridayshows the economy added jobs in March, it may boost the dollarfurther and bolster expectations for Fed rate hikes later thisyear.EURO STRUGGLESAfter rising for two straight days after last week's jointEuropean Union-International Monetary Fund agreement on aid forGreece, the euro ran out of steam on Tuesday.It briefly hit a two-month high against the yen and pushedfurther above $1.35 overnight but retreated on profit-takingand as worries resurfaced about Greece.Though Greece sold 5 billion euros of seven-year debt onMonday, spreads between Greek bonds and benchmark German bundswidened on Tuesday, suggesting investors remain worried.Greek plans to reopen a 20-year bond issue added to worriesabout its funding needs, while news that Ireland would take abigger stake in the banking sector than planned raised concern,limiting euro gains. [ID:nLDE62T0XV] and [ID:nLDE62T0BL]"Last week's deal means it's unlikely you'll see a Greekdefault, but that doesn't mean we won't have concerns about theability of Greece or other peripheral euro zone countries tofund their deficits," said Michael Malpede, analyst at EasyForex in Chicago. "That is going to hurt the euro."The Australian dollar rose to its strongest level in morethan a week at $0.9215  after an Australian central bankwatcher argued the Reserve Bank of Australia was likely to liftinterest rates next week to 4.25 percent. It was last tradingat $0.9172, little changed on the day.(Reporting by Vivianne Rodrigues; Editing by Kenneth Barry)             ]]></raw>
