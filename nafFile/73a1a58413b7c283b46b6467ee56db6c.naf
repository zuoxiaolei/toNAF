<raw><![CDATA[ NEW DELHI, April 19 (Reuters) - Expectations of a normalmonsoon in India for a second straight year have raised hopes ofhigher farm output, which could tame high food prices and helppersuade the government to free rice and wheat exports. India is one of the world's top producers and consumers of arange of commodities such as sugar, grains, oilseeds and cookingoils. The government on Tuesday forecast normal rains for the 2011monsoon. A bad monsoon can force India into the international marketsas a buyer, as happened in 2009 after initial forecasts hadcalled for normal rains.WHAT DOES A "NORMAL" MONSOON MEAN? A normal monsoon means the country receives rainfall between96-104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 centimetres during afour-month season from June, according to the India's weatheroffice classification. WHAT DOES A "BAD" MONSOON MEAN?Rainfall below 90 percent of the long period average will betreated as a bad monsoon, while rainfall above 110 percent ofthe average would mean an excess monsoon.WHEN DOES THE MONSOON ARRIVE IN INDIA? The southwest monsoon arrives in India on the southern coastand usually hits the southern state of Kerala on June 1. Afterhitting the southern tip, it takes about a week to cover thecoffee, tea and rubber growing areas of south India. HOW FAR AND FAST DOES THE MONSOON TRAVEL? The monsoon spreads to the rice-growing areas of easternparts of the country in the first 10 days. It usually covershalf of the country in the first fortnight and enters theoilseed-producing areas of central India in the third week ofJune. Cotton-growing areas in the western region get rains bythe first week of July. By mid-July, the monsoon covers the entire country. DOES A NORMAL MONSOON RULE OUT DROUGHT? No. A normal monsoon indicates overall rainfall to be goodbut does not rule out drought in some areas. Distribution of rains over key crop regions is important forthe overall performance of the monsoon. HOW DOES THE MONSOON IMPACT CROPS? About 60 percent of farms depend on rainfall. Even in regionsthat have irrigation facilities, monsoon rains are beneficialfor crops and help improve yields. DOES THE MONSOON IMPACT OTHER SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY? The farm sector's contribution to the overall economy is 14.6percent. It is the key source of income for the ruralpopulation, which accounts for two-thirds of India's 1.2 billionpeople. Normal rains help improve farm incomes and thus increasedemand for cars, motorcycles and consumer goods. Farmers oftenturn to gold as an option to invest their extra cash in a goodoutput year, boosting demand -- and prices.  Drought increases rural distress, prompting the governmentto increase expenditures on subsidies and welfare schemes forrural areas, which provide the bulk of its support.DOES IT IMPACT MONETARY POLICY? India is currently struggling with high inflation, driven inpart by food and fuel prices. A normal monsoon would easesupplies and could rein in food prices. It would also help tosupport incomes and thus allow the government more flexibilityon passing on high oil prices on to consumers and cuttingsubsidy bills. Reducing inflation could prompt the central bank to easemonetary policy after eight successive interest rate rises. HOW DOES THE MONSOON IMPACT THE ENERGY SECTOR? Monsoon rains replenish reservoirs and increase ground-waterlevels, improving irrigation, which cuts the need for diesel inpumping water from wells. It also helps hydroelectric powergeneration.If a drought means drinking water is scarce, the governmentcan decide to cut supply to power generators or farms andprovide more water to households.
