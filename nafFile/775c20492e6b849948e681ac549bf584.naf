<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The New Zealand dollar slipped against its U.S. counterpart on Monday, easing off a record high hit after official data showed that the nation’s trade surplus widened twice as much as economists expected to a record in April.NZD/USD pulled back from 0.8216, the pair’s highest since exchange rate controls ended in 1985, to hit 0.8175 during late Asian trade, slipping 0.18%.The pair was likely to find support at 0.8068, Friday’s low and resistance at 0.8216, the day’s high.Earlier in the day, Statistics New Zealand said there was a trade surplus of NZD1.1 billion or 24% of the value of exports, from a revised NZD578 surplus in March. Economists had expected the trade surplus to widen to NZD603 million. Following the data, New Zealand’s Prime Minister John Key said that the kiwi was trading at “unsustainable levels” for non-commodity exporters. The exchange rate was “more bearable” for the commodity sector because of high export prices, he said. The kiwi was almost unchanged against its Australian cousin, with AUD/NZD trading at 1.3065.Also Monday, liquidity was relatively thin as U.K. markets were to stay closed for the Spring Bank Holiday and U.S. markets for Memorial Day.             ]]></raw>
