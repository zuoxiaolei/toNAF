<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro slipped against the dollar in Asian trading on Wednesday after investors looked past Greece's recent funding deal and forward to a fast-approaching fiscal cliff in the U.S.In Asian trading on Wednesday, EUR/USD was trading down 0.03% at 1.2938, up from a session low of 1.2935, and off from a high of 1.2946.The pair was likely to find support at 1.2915, Tuesday's low, and resistance at 1.3009, Tuesday's high.EU and IMF officials agreed on a proposal for Greece to cut its debt to 124% of gross domestic product by 2020 in exchange for fresh aid payments, EUR34.4 billion of which will flow into the country's coffers in December, which allayed default fears.The euro initially firmed on the news, though it pared back gains on concerns that the deal still won't resolve underlying problems in Greece and elsewhere in Europe of too much debt and too little growth, which continues to fuel the debt crisis.Meanwhile, the dollar saw support out of fears U.S. policymakers are running out of time to steer the country away from the fiscal cliff, a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts due to take effect at the same time at the end of this year.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said failure to deal with the fiscal cliff could send the economy contracting by 0.5% in 2013 if lawmakers leave the matter unchecked.The dollar gained as investors lost appetite for risk when U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat allied with President Barack Obama, said he was disappointed over the progress of fiscal reforms talks with his Republican counterparts.Democrats and Republicans remain at odds over tax hikes, with the former clamoring for the Bush-era tax breaks to expire for the wealthy to drum up fresh government revenue, and the latter countering that such a move would hit small businesses and force them to put off investing and adding payrolls.Spending cuts have drawn contrasting points of view as well.Fiscal worries in the U.S. coupled with ongoing fears the debt crisis could reheat anew sent investors camping out in the safe-haven greenback despite bullish data out of the U.S., which would otherwise spark demand for stocks and other risk-on asset classes.U.S. consumer confidence rose to its highest level since February 2008 in November, industry data showed on Thursday.The Conference Board, a market research group, reported earlier that its index of consumer confidence rose to 73.7 in November from a reading of 73.1 in October, whose figure was revised up from 72.2. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 73.0 in November. Elsewhere, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that core durable goods orders, which exclude volatile transportation items, rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.5% in October, far outpacing market calls for a 0.5% decline. The report also showed that total orders for durable goods were unchanged last month compared to expectations for a 0.6% decline. Separately, the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index rose at an annualized rate of 3.0% in September from a year earlier, beating expectations for a 2.9% increase.The euro, meanwhile, was slightly off against the pound and up against the yen, with EUR/GBP trading down 0.01% at 0.8077, and EUR/JPY trading up 0.01% at 106.32.Later Wednesday, Germany is to release preliminary data on consumer price inflation, which accounts for a majority of overall inflation.The U.S. is to release official data on new home sales, a leading indicator of economic health, as well as government data on crude oil inventories. Later Wednesday, the Fed is to publish its Beige Book.             ]]></raw>
