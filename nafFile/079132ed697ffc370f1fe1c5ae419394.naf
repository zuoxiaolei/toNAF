<raw><![CDATA[ * Refining margin to narrow in Q3 * Production target tough * Expects to significantly increase 2010 earnings  (Adds details on outlook, shares, oil price) By Eva Komarek and Sylvia Westall VIENNA, Oct 12 (Reuters) - OMV's refining margin narrowed inthe third quarter after improvement in the previous period, theAustrian oil and gas group's chief executive said on Tuesday. OMV, the biggest energy company operating in emergingEurope, releases its third-quarter trading statement on Oct. 21.Its refining margin was $3.39 in the second quarter thanks tobetter prices for products such as heating oil and diesel. "The second quarter was quite good, it has deteriorated inthe third quarter," CEO Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer told the ReutersCentral European Investment Summit in Vienna. Ruttenstorfer said he hoped the refining margin wouldimprove again in the fourth quarter but that it was too early tosay. In the long term he sees refining margins improving. "You will see further improvements between 2010-2012,absolutely," said Ruttentorfer, who steps down next year,predicting margins of $4-5 in the long term. OMV will struggle to reach its 2010 production target of325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed), he said. "There will be an increase. But to reach the 325,000, we arestill struggling," he said. OMV was not planning any acquisitions in the second half inorder to boost production but would try to expand it using itscurrent assets, Ruttenstorfer said. "We will try to squeeze out whatever we can in order to comeclose to our target." OMV hopes to get all of its countriesproducing 25,000 to 30,000 boed, he said.  OUTLOOK Ruttenstorfer did not give a firm outlook for 2010 earningsbut said there would be "significant improvement" on last year. Analysts on average expect 2010 earnings before interest andtax of 2.468 billion euros, according to Thomson ReutersI/B/E/S. "We leave it to the analysts to calculate specific numbers.We don't give any forecasts, but the analysts are well educatedand have a good database." Shares in the Vienna-based company closed 0.8 percent lowerat 28.15 euros. They have fallen 7.5 percent since the start ofthe year, in line with the Stoxx Europe 600 Oil and Gas index. In terms of its markets, OMV has seen some comeback ofenergy demand in central Europe, Ruttenstorfer said. "We still have no rebound in south-eastern Europe, neitheron the oil side, nor on the gas side. We have some positivedevelopments in Turkey," he said. Ruttenstorfer said OMV was not planning any largeacquisitions but was looking at opportunities to expand inexisting markets. OMV dropped plans to take over Turkey's Petrol Ofisi lastyear but says it still remains interested. It acquired Romanian Petrom in 2004 but was hit badly by afailed takeover attempt of Hungarian rival MOL. "We are looking at a couple (of targets) but not bigacquisitions. They would be small or mid-sized," he said. (Editing by Michael Shields)             ]]></raw>
