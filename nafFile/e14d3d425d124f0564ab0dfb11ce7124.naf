<raw><![CDATA[* Telefonica interested in Polkomtel, would be good fit * Telefonica could afford to raise more debt * Deal tough sell to investors after big 2010 buys  By Robert Hetz and Elisabeth O'Leary MADRID, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Telefonica is interested inbuying Polish mobile firm Polkomtel, but such a deal could betough to sell to investors concerned about its sluggish homemarket and after a run of big acquisitions last year.  Sources familiar with the situation said Telefonica, theeuro zone's biggest telecommunications firm has joined a crowdedfield of potential investors studying the possibility of a bidbut it has not decided whether to take part. [ID:nLDE7171GJ Telefonica declined to comment. The purchase of Poland's top mobile group by sales, worth upto 4 billion euros, could fit with Telefonica's current holdingsin the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Telefonica's debt of about 58 billion euros would not, inprinciple, be a hindrance. "Debt is 2.3 times core earnings, but it still hassufficient financial muscle to bid," said Virginia Perez,analyst at brokerage ACF in Madrid.  But with Telefonica's core Spanish market under pressurefrom 20 percent unemployment and last year's 7.5 billion europurchase of Portugal Telecom's stake in Brazil's Vivo fresh ininvestors' minds, the firm might opt to keep its powder dry. Some analysts question Telefonica's ability to reachearnings targets and say a purchase could increase thisscepticism. "(Polkomtel) would be a marginal deal either way forTelefonica, and if it were to be perceived that they wereacquiring a way to reach targets, investors might be sceptical,"said John Davies, analyst at ING in London.  SPAIN DRAGS Telefonica's domestic business has been hit by the end of aproperty boom, which has saddled Spaniards with debt andintensified competition in the telecoms market. Analysts already see Telefonica's goal to raise its dividend25 percent to 1.75 euros per share in 2011/2012 as ambitious. Earlier this week, the telecoms group told the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission that in the fourth quarter of2010 "operations in Spain were affected by difficult economicconditions, lower consumption and greater price competition." Given that backdrop, Chairman Cesar Alierta might have to sit tight. "We believe that an acquisition of this size at this timewould likely not be well-received by the market, and wouldprobably place some pressure on the share price," said broker JBCapital Markets in a note to clients. Shares were down 1.4 percent to 18.31 euros at 1058 GMT onThursday, having risen 9.4 percent so far this year versus a 6.8percent gain in the European Stoxx telecoms sector. Telefonica announces full year results on Feb. 25. Exane BNP Paribas expects a 7.3 percent rise in revenue anda 46 percent rise in profit, with a large part of that due to aboost in the valuation of Vivo after the purchase of PT's stake. Brokerage Bernstein argues Telefonica could opt to issue newshares to buy out other European telecoms businesses such as KPN in The Netherlands, an eternal takeover candidate."Another synergy creating deal - a paper deal for KPN - wouldalmost (but not quite) put the dividend (target) within reach,"Bernstein said in a research note. It said that could entail the merger of Telefonica's O2Germany and KPN's E-Plus, potentially creating up to 3.5 billioneuros in synergies. (Editing by Jane Merriman)             ]]></raw>
