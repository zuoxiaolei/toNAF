<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded lower against the yen during Monday’s Asian session after Japan’s second-quarter GDP report disappointed forex traders. In Asian trading Monday, USD/JPY fell 0.07% 96.19. The pair is likely to find support at 94.82, the low of June 19 and resistance at 97.80, the high of August 7. Earlier Monday, a report showed Japan’s second-quarter GDP grew less than expected. In a report published earlier Monday, data showed Japan’s second-quarter GDP grew 2.6%, well below the growth rate of 3.6% economists expected. The first-quarter growth rate was revised to 3.8%.  "As for the outlook, personal consumption is expected to continue rising moderately. But given capital investment is weaker than personal consumption, we must support a recovery in capital expenditure," said Japanese Economics Minister Akira Amari in a statement. In a separate report, the Bank of Japan said that Japan’s Corporate Goods Price Index rose 2.2% in July after a 1.2% increase in June. Analysts had expected Japan’s Corporate Goods Price Index to rise to 1.9% last month. Last week, the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy unchanged after its policy meeting on Thursday, in a widely expected decision.Japan’s economy was “starting to recover moderately”, the BoJ said in its statement, maintaining language from the previous month. The central bank added that consumer prices have begun to move higher, saying that "inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole." While the GDP report disappointed investors, at least initially, it could serve as yet another sign that Abenomics is working as are BoJ’s easing efforts. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY fell 0.21% to 128.16 while AUD/JPY dropped 0.12% to 88.44.             ]]></raw>
