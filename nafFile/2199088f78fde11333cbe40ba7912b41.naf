<raw><![CDATA[ WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obamawill seek on Monday to pressure Republicans to pass anextension of unemployment benefits that he says is crucial tohelp middle-class families hit by the recession. Obama is to deliver remarks on the economy in the WhiteHouse Rose Garden at 10:30 a.m. (1430 GMT). Fresh from a victory on landmark legislation to revamp WallStreet regulations, Obama still faces eroding confidence in hishandling of the economy and wants to show Americans he isfocused on reviving growth and dealing with a 9.5 percentunemployment rate. Republicans have resisted extending jobless benefits,saying they believe they need to be paid for in the budgetrather than through deficit spending. With congressional elections approaching in November whenObama's Democrats are at risk of big losses, the presidenthopes to put Republicans on the defensive. "Republicans have blocked the extension of emergency relieffor the unemployed three times in the last few weeks, denyingmillions of people who are out work and trying to find a jobthe needed relief," a White House official said. The official said Obama will talk about people who needthe extension "and he will have strong words for Republicanswho have previously supported unemployment extensions underRepublican presidents but refuse to offer relief to middleclass families today." Obama will also accuse Republicans of "calling for hundredsof billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthiest Americanswhile telling working families that we can't afford to helpthem when they need it most." Senate Democrats have scheduled another vote on theunemployment benefits for Tuesday.(Reporting by Caren Bohan, editing by Alan Elsner)             ]]></raw>
