<raw><![CDATA[ COPENHAGEN, Sept 27 (Reuters) - The world's biggestcontainer shipper, Maersk Line, is increasingly serving LatinAmerica and Africa with ships sailing directly from Asia to tapaccelerating growth in those markets, the Financial Times said. Many of the ships that Maersk Line -- part of Danishshipping and oil group A.P. Moller-Maersk -- has on order overthe next two years are designed to meet growing African andLatin American demand, Maersk Line chief Eivind Kolding wasquoted as saying in the paper's Monday edition. "The tonnage that we have on order and will get deliveredover the next two years is very much suited for the SouthAmerica and Africa market, so that's the direction that wealready are moving," Kolding said, according to the FT. The global shipping industry is recovering this year from adisastrous 2009 when the Maersk group suffered its first loss.There are signs that the pace of recovery is slowing, the FTsaid. "It's really the west and the old economies that have agrowth issue," Kolding said. "It's not the rest of the world." The fast emerging market growth could reduce the importanceof such hubs as Algeciras in Spain and Salalah in Oman whereMaersk's Asia-Europe services collect and discharge manycontainers going to and coming from Africa, the FT said. In the short run, Maersk Line would idle some ships to meetslowing demand, it said. "There will simply be too much capacityin the market, so our response is that we take out some capacityfrom the start of October," Kolding said, according to the FT.
