<raw><![CDATA[ * Current account deficit 4.4 bln euros in Sep, vs 8.1 blnyear ago * Imports falling as Spaniards cut spending  (Adds details, explanation) MADRID, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Spain's current account deficitfell to 4.4 billion euros ($6.57 billion) in September, down byalmost half from the 8.1 billion euro shortfall in the samemonth last year, the Bank of Spain said on Monday. The smaller deficit was partly due to a declining tradedeficit, thanks to a 21.3 percent fall in imports as Spaniardswere forced by disappearing credit to restrict theirconsumption, the bank's data showed. But Spain's surplus in services fell in September comparedto a year earlier, due to a fall in the surplus from tourism to2.9 billion euros from 3.15 billion euros in September 2008. Spain's tourist industry has been hit by declining visitsfrom recession-hit European partners, especially Britain, wherethe effect has been intensified by the fall in the value of thepound against the euro. In the first nine months of the year, the current accountdeficit stood at 33.8 billion euros, down from 69.5 billioneuros in the same period of 2008. Towards the end of a decade-long boom, Spain's currentaccount deficit approached an annual 100 billion euros or 10percent of gross domestic product. It was made possible in largepart by foreign institutional investors, many of them inGermany, buying bonds issued by Spanish banks, which then usedthe funds to provide credit to fuel a property and consumptionboom. With this source of debt now dried up, Spain is being forcedto bring its spending closer to its income, a major reason forthe current steep contraction in both GDP and retail sales.
