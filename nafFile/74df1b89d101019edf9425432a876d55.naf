<raw><![CDATA[ * Italy's Draghi seen as impressive, intelligent -paper * Frieden says has to evaluate other names as well -paper * German daily says France would support German candidate  (Adds no comment on Luxembourg's Mersch, German newspaper) MILAN, Feb 15 (Reuters) - A successor to Jean-Claude Trichetas head of the European Central Bank (ECB) needs to be decidedon quickly to avoid instability, Luxembourg Finance Minister LucFrieden said in newspaper comments on Tuesday. He told Italy's La Stampa daily that Bundesbank PresidentAxel Weber had been a good candidate to be ECB president beforehe dropped out last week. Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghiwas impressive and intelligent, he said in an interview. "There is a need to decide as soon as possible. Trichetleaves in October. A delay risks generating instability,"Frieden said. Draghi's time with U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs GroupInc  is not a problem and having worked in the privatesector can be a big advantage, he said. Draghi has a chance of becoming ECB president if he is acandidate, Frieden said. "I have known Draghi for some time. I have always found himimpressive and intelligent ... Don't ask me, however, now, if Iwill vote for him. First I have to evaluate the other names aswell," he said. European Union leaders are expected to select a new ECBpresident around the middle of the year. Draghi is amongfront-runners for the job. [ID:nLDE7181F1] In the interview, Frieden made no comments on Luxembourg'scentral bank governor Yves Mersch and whether his governmentwould propose him for the ECB. Mersch has been speculated aboutas one of the candidates to take over from Trichet. In the newspaper interview, Frieden also said that work onnew euro zone fiscal governance rules was going too slowly. Oncethere is political consensus the details can be completed byexperts in two or three days, he said. Meanwhile, a German newspaper reported on Tuesday thatFrance would support the selection of a German candidate tosucceed Trichet. "A German at the head of the ECB would send a strong signalto financial markets that the Bundesbank's rescue efforts forthe euro would be brought along," business daily Handelsblattquoted an unnamed person familiar with the situation as saying. France would continue to follow this line of thinking, theperson told the paper, and did not support a candidate for thejob from a small EU country or Italy, it added. Paris feels Draghi's time spent working at Goldman Sachs ispolitically detrimental, the paper reported.
