<raw><![CDATA[ * GDP down 8.1 pct y/y, smallest fall since Feb * Seasonally adjusted GDP estimated up 0.3 pct m/m * Trade balance at $88 bln in Jan-Oct  (Adds quote, background) MOSCOW, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Russia's gross domestic productposted its smallest year-on-year contraction in eight months inOctober, the Economy Ministry said on Monday, likely reflectingimprovement in retail sales and real wages. GDP fell 8.1 percent on the year and rose a seasonallyadjusted 0.3 percent on the month, said Oleg Zasov, acting headof the macroeconomic forecasting department at the ministry.  "The economy, adjusted for seasonal factors, is continuingto grow for a fifth month in a row," he told reporters. Retail sales and real wages both rose on the month inOctober [ID:nLK595812], even as rising unemployment andlacklustre industrial output underlined the fragility ofRussia's recovery from its first recession in a decade. Russia was hit in the second half of 2008 by falling oil andcommodity prices, investor flight from emerging markets and theglobal credit crunch. This summer brought early signs of recovery from its firstrecession in a decade, with the economy returning toseasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter growth in the July toSeptember period. [ID:nLK93407] However officials have stressed that it is too soon to callan end to the crisis. Further proof of this came from the statepostal service, which on Monday announced it would slash atleast 33,000 jobs in 2010. [ID:nGEE5AM0GT] Zasov also estimated November inflation at 0.3-0.4 percenton the month, in line with previous forecasts. He said that Russia posted a trade surplus of $88 billion inJanuary-October, up from the $75 billion reported for the firstnine months of 2009. Sizeable surpluses have helped fan a rally in the rouble in the past 2-1/2 months. But the trend could reverseas a stronger currency makes imports more expensive. The Economy Ministry is due to release its GDP data onTuesday.
