<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar slid lower against the yen on Friday, paring back some of the week’s gains after a three notch downgrade to Spain’s sovereign rating pushed investors towards the safety of the yen.USD/JPY hit 79.78 on Thursday, the pair’s highest since May 25; the pair subsequently consolidated at 79.45 by close of trade on Friday, up 1.74% on the week.The pair is likely to find support at 78.86, the low of May 30 and resistance at 80.06, the high of May 23.Rating’s agency Fitch cut Spain's credit rating by three notches to triple-B on Friday, and indicated that further cuts could still be made as the country struggles to stabilize its fragile banking system. The downgrade came as senior European Union officials prepared to discuss options for financial aid to Madrid in a telephone conference on Saturday morning.Traders also remained cautious after China announced a surprise interest rate cut on Thursday, which some market participants took as a sign that the world’s second largest economy may be slowing more than previously thought.The greenback touched an almost two-week high against the yen on Thursday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned that the U.S. economy faced “significant risks” arising from the crisis in Europe, but refrained from indicating that the central bank was prepared to implement any fresh stimulus measures.In testimony to a congressional committee in Washington, Bernanke said that the Fed remained "prepared to take action" to protect the U.S. economy and financial system if stresses on the financial system escalate, but stopped short of indicating what these actions might be.On Monday, Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the central bank was closely monitoring the impact of the yen’s recent gains on Japan’s largely export driven economy, but stopped short of indicating if the bank is planning any further monetary easing in the short-term.In the week ahead, markets will be keeping a close eye on developments in Spain, as Madrid begins to hammer out the details of a rescue package for its banks, while uncertainty over the outcome of Greek elections on June 17 is likely to weigh.Investors will also be eyeing the outcome of a BoJ policy setting meeting on Friday, as well as Wednesday’s U.S. retail sales data, as investors try to gauge the strength of the country’s economic recovery.
