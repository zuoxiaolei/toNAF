<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro rises as global risk appetite grows * ECB assurances on liquidity provisions help lift euro * Solid Spanish bond demand also contribute to gains * ECB keeps rates on hold; silent on bond purchase program * Chinese export jump boosts confidence on global economy (Adds comments, details; changes byline) By Steven C. Johnson and Vivianne Rodrigues NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday fora third straight day as strong demand for Spanish bonds easedconcern about the country's ability to finance its debt and aspike in Chinese exports boosted confidence on global growth. Investors also breathed a sigh of relief after EuropeanCentral Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said three-monthemergency loans to banks would continue until September andwhen Germany's high court rejected efforts to block Germanguarantees for euro zone financial aid.

It was last up 1 percent to $1.2084 ,headed for its best day against the dollar in two weeks. Despite this week's gains, the euro has lost more than 15percent against the dollar in 2010 and declines may resume. "We tried to maintain a break below $1.20 and reallystruggled. Then Trichet offered reassurance by extendingthree-month funding, and now shorts are getting squeezed," saidStandard Chartered currency strategist Mike Moran. "I don't think we've seen the bottom for the euro thisyear, but this latest down leg is running out of steam," hesaid. The ECB left interest rates on hold as expected and raisedslightly its 2010 growth forecast, though Trichet said the paceof growth would be uneven in coming quarters. Technical analysts said the euro's downward trend wouldcome into question on a move above $1.2135, the 50 percentretracement of the 2000-2008 euro rally. But Brown Brothers Harriman strategist Marc Chandler saidit would probably take a move above $1.25 to signal a realsentiment shift, and Moran said good selling interest was seenaround $1.2450. Further technical support level for the single currency isseen at $1.2705 while resistance will be found at $1.2854,according to Reuters data. GOOD NEWS FROM SPAIN, CHINA The euro also rose 0.7 percent to 110.14 yen ,while the dollar fell 0.3 percent to 90.98 yen . Sterling rose 0.8 percent to $1.4660 . Earlier, theBank of England left interest rates at a record low ahead ofthe government's June 22 budget, which will detail thebelt-tightening the UK faces as it tries to cut its deficit. Solid demand at a Spanish auction also eased concern andcemented support for the euro. The amount of bonds sold came inat the top of the expected range, even though they were sold ata premium compared to a similar issue in April. The auction "adds to the story that the euro may be due abit of a bounce as it has come a long way down in a relativelyshort space of time," said Gavin Friend, currency strategist atnabCapital. Investors were also cheered when China confirmed thatexports jumped 48.5 percent in the 12 months to May. That easedconcern that Europe's debt woes would hurt the global economy.[ID:nTOE65605K] European and U.S. stocks rose and the growth-sensitiveAustralian dollar  soared 2.2 percent to $0.8462,buoyed by strong Australian jobs data. An interest rate rise inNew Zealand lifted the kiwi dollar 2 percent to $0.6839. NO BOND BUYING DETAILS Investors did not get new details from the European CentralBank about its program to buy euro zone government bonds,though Trichet said the purchases would not alter the bank'smonetary policy stance. As of Friday, the ECB had bought 40.5 billion euros worthof euro zone debt, a program it began last month as sellingpressure on Spanish, Greek and other sovereign debt increased. The program is designed to lower countries' borrowingcosts. (Additional reporting by Jessica Mortimer in London; Editingby Diane Craft)             ]]></raw>
