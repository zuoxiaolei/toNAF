<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro rises 0.3 percent to $1.3260 * Potential for further rebound from ECB bond buying * Overall euro downtrend prevails; U.S. jobs data due (Adds quote, detail) By Neal Armstrong LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on Friday asreported central bank buying of Portuguese and Irish debt inrecent days soothed investor nerves and helped the currencyrebound from a 2-1/2 month low, but sentiment remained fragile. The market's immediate focus moved to U.S. payrolls datalater in the day, with a surprisingly strong U.S. housing numberon Thursday adding to budding optimism on the U.S. economy. The euro stood at $1.3260, up 0.3 percent on the day andwell above a 2-1/2 month low of $1.2969 plumbed on Tuesday aftermassive selling in euro zone periphery government bonds. Traders said the ECB continued to buy Portuguese and Irishdebt on Friday, easing investor panic over euro zone debt fornow. Large euro/dollar option expiries at $1.3200 and $1.3250were slowing the rally, while the technical picture was helpedby the euro holding above its 200-day moving average at $1.3123. Some analysts said the euro's bounce could have further togo, given the positioning in the market and thin liquidity. "The euro has further room to correct to the upside asstrong ECB bond-buying will support sentiment and speculativepositioning is short," said Manuel Oliveri, currency analyst atUBS in Zurich. "It can move up to $1.3400/$1.3450 but it remains a sell onrallies - the overall trend is still down," he said. Sentiment towards the smaller euro zone states remainedprecariously balanced after Standard and Poor's warned onThursday it may downgrade Greece in three months. "The ECB has done a good job in reassuring the markets thisweek and the euro zone PMI this morning has also helped, but theeuro is not out of the woods yet," said Jane Foley, seniorcurrency analyst at Rabobank.  The Markit Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers Index(PMI), which surveys more than 2,000 businesses ranging frombanks to hotels, rose in November to 55.4 from 53.3 in Octoberand beating an earlier flash estimate of 55.2. The euro's 100-day moving average, at around $1.3327, wasseen as the next resistance level. More important resistancelurked in the $1.3334-64 area, its August peak and a 38.2percent retracement of its June-November rally. The sharp fall in the yields on Spanish, Portuguese andother countries' bonds offset initial disappointment after ECBPresident Jean-Claude Trichet did not explicitly commit the bankto ramping up bond buying on Thursday.  PAYROLLS Traders were looking to the U.S. jobs data, due at 1330 GMT,which is expected to show an increase of 140,000 jobs lastmonth, according to a Reuters survey. Although data on Thursday showed initial jobless claims rosemore than expected, anecdotal evidence of strong sales aroundthe Thanksgiving holiday and a surprise jump in the house salesindex boosted investor risk appetite. "The impact of today's U.S. payrolls report on risk appetiteis likely to be the key determinant of the dollar's response.Since the trend has been towards stronger data flow in the U.S.,a weak report is likely to represent a bigger shock to themarket than strength," said Citibank analysts in a note toclients. Some traders said a strong jobs figure was likely toencourage more risk appetite, which could help the euro. The dollar changed hands at 83.50 yen, down 0.4 percent fromlate U.S. levels and off Monday's two-month high of 84.41 yen.Strong support was seen at the top end of the pair's Ichimokucloud at around 83.18.
