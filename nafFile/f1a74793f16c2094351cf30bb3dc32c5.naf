<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds details from statement, background) By Sumeet Desai ISTANBUL, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The Group of Seven rich nationson Saturday said too much volatility in foreign exchangemarkets could hurt the global economy and financial system, andagain welcomed China's pledge to move toward greater currencyflexibility. The language on currencies in a final communique issued bythe G7 finance ministers and central bankers after a meeting inIstanbul was nearly identical to a statement released aftertheir last meeting in April. "Excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchangerates have adverse implications for economic and financialstability. We continue to monitor exchange markets closely, andcooperate as appropriate," the communique said. Some European nations had wanted to change the G7currencies statement to reflect their concerns about astrengthening euro. But in the end policymakers agreed on their usual languageand maintained the softer tone on China's yuan, or renminbi,first adopted in February. "We welcome China's continued commitment to move to a moreflexible exchange rate, which should lead to continuedappreciation of the renminbi in effective terms and helppromote more balanced growth in China and in the worldeconomy." G7 countries are concerned that an undervalued yuan isfueling Chinese exports at the expense of their own,contributing to an uneven global economy where Beijing runshuge trade surpluses and the United States large deficits. There was little in the communique on the future of the G7itself, which had been a source of much speculation after thewider G20 body -- a group that includes China and otherdeveloping economies -- declared itself the premier forum forglobal economic policymaking last week. The G7 said it saw "signs of global economic recovery andcontinued improvement in financial market conditions." But it stressed: "There is no room for compacency since theprospects for growth remained fragile and labour marketconditions are not yet improving." The communique said that economic life-support packageswould be kept in place until recovery is assured but promisedto design cooperative and coordinated exit strategies for uselater.
