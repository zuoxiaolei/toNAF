<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro debt worries hit stocks, euro again * Euro loses 1 percent against dollar * World stocks also down 1 percent  By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Financial markets were batteredon Friday by worries over peripheral euro zone debt, knockingEuropean stocks down 1 percent and the euro by the same amountagainst the dollar. The cost of insuring against a default by peripheral eurozone countries rose again. Wall Street also looked set to open lower following itsThanksgiving break on Thursday and a large run up of stocks onWednesday. Two newspaper reports were helping set the tone. TheFinancial Times Deutschland reported, without revealing itssources, that a majority of euro zone members and the EuropeanCentral Bank were urging Portugal to apply for a financialbailout. [ID:nLDE6AP08Y] EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, the Portugueseand German governments denied the report was true. The Irish Times, meanwhile, said officials at theInternational Monetary Fund and in the European Union wereexamining how senior bondholders could be compelled to pay someof the cost of rescuing Ireland's banks. [ID:nLDE6AP0BY] The reports fed into general market disquiet about how theeuro zone debt crisis -- created by questions about whetherindebted countries' can meet bond payments -- will play out. "Officials now seem to be pressing Portugal to take aid andthat's unsettling investors. Peripheral issues are unlikely togo away in the short-term and the euro will remain underpressure into the end of the year," said Manuel Oliveri,currency strategist at UBS in Zurich. In the past month, there have been some hefty losses ineuro/dollar and on European bourses as a result of the crisis.The reaction has not yet, however, matched those seen in May andJune around the time of the Greek crisis. This is in large part because of the creation of a bailoutmechanism involving the European Union and InternationalMonetary Fund. The EU is attempting to create a more permanent mechanism,but the various proposals floated for what it might contain havecreated highly volatile markets. The irony is that it is occurring just as the world economicrecovery is gaining traction.  EURO SLIDED The euro fell around 1 percent against the dollar to freshtwo-month lows  while the dollar was boosted by variousfactors, ranging from rising optimism about the U.S. economy totensions in the Korean peninsula. The euro  was at $1.3223, levels last seen inSeptember. European shares fell, with banks in particular in focus.  The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shareswas down 1.4 percent, although it is still up around 67 percentfrom its lifetime low in March 2009. "It is amazing how resilient markets have been consideringthe financial explosions we have had in Europe and the gunfirein Korea," said Justin Urquhart Stewart, director at SevenInvestment Management. "The market is still trying to find where it goes next. Alot of people may well be saying 'I will take my profits andsquare the books'." MSCI's all country world index  was down 1percent and its emerging market benchmark  lost 1.6percent. Ireland's 10 year bonds  were yielding 8.9percent, Portuguese counterparts  7.2 percent andSpanish 10-year debt  5.3 percent. By contrast, German Bunds  yielded 2.6 percent.
