<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro/dollar at 6-wk high, dollar index at 6-week low * Positive U.S. corporate earnings boost risk demand * CIT strikes last-minute rescue deal, sources say * Risk assets overextended, may be due for a correction(Updates prices, adds comment, changes byline) By Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - The dollar weakened broadlyon Monday, hitting a six-week low against the euro, as strongU.S. corporate earnings prompted investors to plunge back intohigh-yielding currencies and other risky assets. Reports of a last-minute rescue for ailing U.S. lender CITGroup boosted optimism, helping push the euro to $1.4249, itshighest level since early June. For more, see [ID:nN206604] An index of the dollar against six major currencies hit asix-week low , while the yen fell and the Australian andNew Zealand dollars soared. Both rose last week when GoldmanSachs  and Intel  reported strong second-quarterearnings, fanning hopes that an economic recovery is underway. "It's a risk-preference story. With equities firmer andbreaking some semi-interesting levels, the dollar has comeunder pressure as a result," said John McCarthy, director offoreign exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York. Volume was lighter than usual, however, with Tokyoshuttered for a local holiday. The euro was last up 0.9 percent at $1.4220 . A climbabove $1.4337 touched in early June would take the pair to itshighest level of the year. The euro also added 0.9 percent to 134.00 yen while the dollar was flat at 94.25 yen . Sterling rose 1.2 percent to $1.6525 , near athree-week high hit earlier, while the New Zealand dollarneared its 2009 high of $0.6595, rising 1.7 percent to $0.6565. Australia's dollar rose 1.4 percent to $0.8130 . SEEING IS BELIEVING Some analysts said the euro looked overextended, especiallyafter it failed to add to its gains following an upbeat reporton U.S. leading indicators. [ID:nN20360679]. The euro and high-yielders like the Australian dollar "arehaving a really impressive run, which leaves them vulnerable toprofit-taking if upcoming data or earnings undershoot themarket's elevated expectations," said Omer Esiner, marketanalyst at Travelex Global Business Payments in Washington. HSBC in a research note pointed out that stock market gainsalso look set to fade and say some of the current rally may bea "squeeze" of investors who expected a summer slump to followlast spring's rally. "We're not sure that a lot more people now 'believe' thestock market will continue to rally from here," said HSBC. But for now, investors are content to run with the pack,said Jay Meisler, principal of Global-view.com, an online forumfor traders and investors. "I get the sense there is some skepticism over this latestbout of risk appetite but it is hard to stand in the way," hesaid, "especially when forecasts, such as the one from GoldmanSachs today, get raised." Goldman raised its year-end target on the Standard & Poor's500 index  to 1060 from 940 on Monday. [ID:nBNG20894] Still to come this week are earnings from American Express,State Street and Bank of New York-Mellon.
