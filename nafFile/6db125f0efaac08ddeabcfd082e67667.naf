<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The pound held steady against the dollar on Wednesday after giving back earlier gains on news the U.S. Congress voted on tax and spending reforms needed to avoid the fiscal cliff, which enticed investors out of the safety of the greenback.Fiscal debates will return in the U.S., however, when the country hits its USD16.4 trillion debt ceiling likely in February, which fueled some demand for the safe-haven greenback.In U.S. trading on Wednesday, GBP/USD was trading at 1.6242, down 0.02%, up from a session low of 1.6226 and off from a high of 1.6381.The pair was likely to find support at 1.6134, Monday's low, and resistance at 1.6454, the high from Aug. 29, 2011.Failure to reach a deal to avoid the cliff, a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts taking effect simultaneously with the arrival of 2013, could have contracted the U.S. economy by 0.5% this year, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, which would constitute a recession.Cable soared on the news earlier, especially after manufacturing data on both sides of the Atlantic sparked demand for risk, which came at the greenback's expense. In the U.K., data released earlier revealed that manufacturing activity in December grew at its fastest pace since September 2011.The Markit manufacturing purchasing managersâ€™ index came in at 51.4, from an upwardly revised reading of 49.2 in November. Analysts had expected the manufacturing PMI to remain unchanged.In the U.S., manufacturing activity in the U.S. grew at a faster rate in December than analysts had predicted.The Institute for Supply Management said its index of purchasing managers rose to 50.7 in December, up from 49.5 in November and beating expectations for a 50.3 reading.Profit-taking ensued on concerns fiscal uncertainty will return to the U.S., which sparked demand for the safe-haven dollar.U.S. lawmakers must now debate raising the U.S. government's USD16.4 trillion debt ceiling likely sometime around February.The Treasury Department can delay defaulting temporarily via taking extraordinary measures though lawmakers will eventually vote to lift the country's borrowing limit.In 2011, Congress waited until the last minute to raise the debt ceiling, narrowly avoiding default although Standard & Poor's stripped the U.S. of its coveted triple-A rating.The pound, meanwhile, was up against the euro and up against the yen, with EUR/GBP trading down 0.15% at 0.8108 and GBP/JPY up 0.36% at 141.47.             ]]></raw>
