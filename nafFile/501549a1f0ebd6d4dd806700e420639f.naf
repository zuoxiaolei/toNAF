<raw><![CDATA[ BRUSSELS, July 9 (Reuters) - The European Union will reviewtariffs on imports of the chemical compound barium carbonatefrom China after Belgian chemicals company Solvay asked thatthey be extended by five years, EU diplomats said on Friday. European national governments have approved the review. TheEU's executive European Commission has until July 22, when theduties are due to expire, to launch the probe. The review will take up to 15 months, during which time theduties are to be maintained, and could result in tariffs beingextended by up to five years.  "There was no opposition to the probe from EU member states.It throws up the strategic question of whether Europe should letits last remaining producer go out of business," one source toldReuters. Solvay subsidiary Solvay and CPC Barium Strontium isEurope's only producer of barium carbonate, which is used in theproduction of glass, bricks, tiles and television screens. European glass and building products producers buy about 50million euros ($63.4 million) of the product every year. Europeis the most recent region to act against Chinese shipments ofthe compound, following the United States, Brazil and India. "It's very likely that if there are no antidumping dutiesEurope will become the sales destination for China, particularlygiven the fact that there are antidumping duties imposed byother countries," said Rodrigo Elizondo, managing director atSolvay and CPC Barium Strontium. Chinese trade officials in Brussels could not immediately bereached for comment. (Reporting by Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck, editing by DaleHudson)             ]]></raw>
