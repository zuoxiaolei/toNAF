<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar retreats from 2-1/2-month high ahead of Fed * Euro holds above $1.45 support * U.S. consumer price data shows modest rise in November * Markets watching for any mention of Fed policy exit (Recasts, updates prices) NEW YORK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slipped onWednesday ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting and after datashowing tame inflation last month suggested the U.S. centralbank need not rush to lift interest rates from record lows. That helped the euro bounce off a 2-1/2-month low hit oneday ago, with traders buying the currency after it failed tobreak below $1.45. For more on the U.S. data, see[ID:nLDE5BF1RP]. Most analysts expect the Fed to stick to its pledge to keepinterest rates near zero for an "extended period" when itissues a post-meeting statement on Wednesday around 2:15 p.m.,(1915 GMT) suggesting no rate hike until well into next year. A run of strong U.S. data lately raised speculation the Fedcould hike rates sooner than expected, a move that would boostthe value of dollar-based assets. "I don't think the Fed will want to say too much that rocksthe boat at this time of the year," said Firas Askari, head ofFX trading at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. "The recentdollar bounce on strong U.S. data is interesting and perhapsmeans markets are taking a longer view, but I don't think ratesare going to be touched until next summer." The euro  was up 0.1 percent at $1.4551 after slidingto around $1.4512 earlier. The euro fell to its weakest sinceearly October on Tuesday. Concern about some parts of the euro zone banking sectorand sovereign credit-worthiness this week may have overshot,aiding the euro's rebound back toward $1.46, said Michael Hart,strategist at Citigroup in London. An illustration was the muted market reaction to Standard &Poor's cutting Greece's credit ratings by one notch onWednesday, saying a further downgrade is possible if thegovernment fails to gain political support for a fiscalconsolidation program. [ID:nWNA0333]The euro's failure to test key support around $1.4480prompted Citigroup strategists to take profits on short eurotrades, the bank said in a research note. It added that highergold and oil prices should spark short-term dollar weakness. The euro showed limited reaction to the European CentralBank's final one-year liquidity operation at which banksborrowed 97 billion euros. AUSSIE DOWN, STERLING RALLIES The dollar index, a non-traded calculation of the dollar'sperformance against a basket of six currencies, was down 0.2percent at 76.811 , slipping from the 2 1/2-month highthe previous day. Against the yen, it was last up 0.1 percentat 89.73 yen , pulling away from the day's low around89.40 yen. The dollar has lost more than 5 percent against the basketof currencies this year on the view that other central bankswill raise rates before the Fed does. The Australian dollar  fell 0.8 percent at $0.8992after Australia's gross domestic product grew by 0.2 percent inthe third quarter, less than forecast, while dovish centralbank remarks prompted investors to trim expectations fortightening next year. [ID:nSGE5BE06K] Australia lifted its cash rate 75 basis points in just 3months but investors are now anticipating a pause at theFebruary RBA meeting which some analysts suggest may evensignal an end to the current tightening cycle. Sterling rallied after a surprisingly strong UK employmentreport suggested the British economy was on the mend. The poundwas up 0.4 percent at $1.6345  and the euro fell throughkey 100-day moving average technical support at 89.25 pence totrade at 88.96 pence . Norway's crown hit a three-week high against the euro and rose sharply against the dollar  after theNorges Bank lifted interest rates for the second time in threemonths. [ID:nOSL011988]. The Fed, meanwhile, "is likely to tweak the statement tonote that conditions in financial markets have improvedmodestly since the last meeting," Barclays analysts said in anote. "But the broader message should remain that the Fed doesnot expect to change its policy stance soon."
