<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The euro rebounded against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, pulling back from a 4-day low ahead of the release of key data on the U.S. job market.  During European morning trade, EUR/USD bounced to 1.3576 from 1.3539, its lowest rate since last Friday. The pair was likely to find resistance at 1.3788, Wednesday's high.  EUR/USD was likely to find immediate support at 1.3531, last Friday's low and an 8-month low, after which the next support level was likely to be around 1.3423, the low of May 18.  Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Labor was set to publish later Thursday data on jobless claims, a key measure of the job market's health, and its monthly Producer Price Index.  On Wednesday, Federal Reserve minutes revealed that several policymakers seek to begin selling securities relatively soon as the U.S. economic recovery picks up pace.             ]]></raw>
