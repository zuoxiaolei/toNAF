<raw><![CDATA[ By Ed Cropley JOHANNESBURG, April 1 (Reuters) - With municipal electionsdue in May, South Africa's political temperature is bound torise, with protests against unemployment and shoddy publicservices, and mudslinging by politicians. Some protests will be violent and the rhetoric vitriolic,but not likely to be enough to cause material changes togovernment spending plans that some economists say are overlyexpansive and risk an unsustainable budget deficit. That said, state employees have rejected an initial 4.8percent pay offer, demanding a 10 percent raise that is nearlythree times current inflation. President Jacob Zuma has made tackling persistent 25 percentunemployment his top priority, but his plans so far have managedto anger unions, who say they will harm workers, andbusinessmen, who say they will make labour more expensive.  ELECTION The dominance of Zuma's African National Congress (ANC) inthe May 18 municipal polls is not in doubt. Instead, the vote ismore interesting as a gauge of Zuma's leadership and popularitynationally and inside his ruling alliance. Labour federation COSATU, a formal ANC partner in governmentand a powerful vote-getting machine, is using the election topush for policy influence by saying it will only support ANCcandidates it sees as free from the taint of corruption. Five out of South Africa's nine provinces have already seenviolent demonstrations against the ANC's annointment ofcandidates, suggesting popular discontent with what is seen asthe ruling party handing out positions to its friends. The election may also ignite protests by the legions of poorblack South Africans over a lack of housing, healthcare andbasic schools and amenities, despite billions of dollars ofsocial spending in the 17 years since the end of apartheid. It could even set off another spate of violence againstforeigners, as politicians pandering for votes blame immigrantsfor a lack of jobs and public services.  What to watch: - COSATU opposing ANC candidates or attacking Zuma - Anti-foreigner political rhetoric or violence - Public sector wage negotiations  THE RAND AND INFLATION The rand has gained more than 26 percent against the dollarsince the start of 2009, giving Africa's biggest economy a majorbuffer against inflation even thought exporters in themanufacturing and mining sectors have suffered. However, soaring world oil prices and a recovering economyhave put the heat under inflation once more and interest rateslook set to rise from 30-year lows before the end of the year,increasing the allure of the currency to foreign investors. As the elections approach, unions, industry and ANCleft-wingers are likely to renew their calls for randdevaluation -- 8 to the dollar is a popular cry -- although theTreasury and central bank show no signs of buckling. Both have said repeatedly that markets should determine thelevel of the currency, and the Reserve Bank has saidintervention will remain limited to accumulating foreigncurrency reserves. A tax on short-term capital inflows to curb rand strengthappears equally unlikely. What to watch: - Levels of central bank dollar-buying - Signs of cracks in central bank, treasury opposition torand intervention  LABOUR AND THE ECONOMY The ANC is proposing sweeping changes to labour laws toincrease job security for temporary workers, but economists saythe shake-up will worsen unemployment by piling more costs onemployers. The bills are the most contentious pieces of legislation inparliament and any watering down could cause friction betweenthe ANC and COSATU, which has threatened "the mother of allbattles" over the reforms. COSATU wants no changes to the laws, which aim to endexploitation of temporary workers by so-called "labour brokers"by transforming part-timers into full-time employees. But a government-commissioned report said the four billswould deal a whopping blow to the economy, which is strugglingto shake off the after-effects of a 2009 recession. Zuma has pledged 39 billion rand ($5.6 billion) for jobcreation and factory investment to make a dent in unemployment-- part of a package of measures that is keeping the budgetdeficit at 5.3 percent of GDP despite pledges last year to cutit sooner rather than later. What to watch for: - Progress of the labour bills through parliament  CORRUPTION A series of mining scandals involving companies with closefamily ties to Zuma, and the assassination of a Cape Townunderworld boss alleged to have high-level government protectionhave raised serious questions about the police and officialdom. The mining imbroglios have fuelled the belief that the ANCunder Zuma, whose presidency runs until 2014, is suffering aleadership vacuum where cronyism can thrive. Since the scandals, the mines ministry has imposed amoratorium on new licence applications and launched an audit ofexisting licences. Preliminary results of the audit revealed a wide array ofproblems, although the ministry says they will be fixed. Thelifting the moratorium at the start of April and more completeresults of the audit should indicate whether that is possible. Meanwhile, last month's hit on Cape Town godfather CyrilBeeke, and the subsequent arrest of a fugitive Czech businessmanhave exposed a web of links between the underworld, police andsenior ANC figures, bringing the neutrality of the criminaljustice system into doubt. What to watch: - More revelations from the mining audit, whose success orotherwise is a barometer of ANC committment to tackling cronyism - Trial of Czech businessman Radovan Krejcir, which couldexpose a feared rot in justice system  NATIONALISATION Senior ANC economic figure Enoch Godongwana stunned businesslast month when he said the government was considering copying acontroversial Australian mining windfall tax to redress the "rawdeal" South Africans were getting from existing minerals levies. Speaking in Sydney, Godongwana said nationalisation of themines -- as the ANC's radical Youth League wants -- was notpolicy, but his comments rekindled fears of more, not less,state intervention in the sector as commodity prices soar. Despite his talk of a mining tax shake-up, nothing concreteis expected before the ANC's next major policy conference, in2012. Nationalisation is extremely unlikely given the massiveeconomic and political costs it would entail. A new state coalmining firm appears to have defined the limits -- so far -- ofactive state participation. What to watch: - Imposition of a minerals windfall tax - How the new state mining firm functions             ]]></raw>
