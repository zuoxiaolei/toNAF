<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro on track for biggest monthly fall since Jan 2009 * Fitch cuts Spain's credit rating; outlook stable * US consumer spending flat, dims risk appetite (Adds reference to decline vs U.S. dollar in secondparagraph) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, May 28 (Reuters) - The euro fell across the boardon Friday after Fitch Ratings downgraded Spain's credit rating,rekindling concerns about a sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone. The euro was on track for a hefty 7.7 percent declineagainst the U.S. dollar in May, in what would be the sixthconsecutive monthly fall and the biggest percentage drop sinceJanuary 2009. Fitch cut Spain's credit rating by one notch to AA-plus,saying the country's economic recovery will be "more muted"than the government forecast due to its austerity measures. Theoutlook on the new rating is stable.

"We are still negative on the euro. We think this is goingto be a multiyear bear trend for the euro," he added. In late New York trading, the euro was at $1.2271 ,down 0.8 percent, after dipping as low as $1.2265, according toelectronic trading platform EBS. Analysts said a key support level is $1.2135, the 50percent Fibonacci retracement of the 2000-08 advance, justabove the recent four-year low of $1.2143. Charts further showa monthly close below $1.2135 would favor more weakness, withanalysts seeing the next downside support at $1.1640, a low hitin November 2005. Against the yen, the euro was down 0.9 percent at 111.56, after hitting an intraday low of 111.35 on EBS. The dollar  slipped 0.2 percent to 90.89 yen, whilethe dollar index , which measures the greenback'sperformance against a basket of currencies, was up 0.7 percentat 86.751. The dollar and yen gained as U.S. stocks fell and datashowing U.S. consumer spending unexpectedly stalled in Aprilweighed on risk appetite. See wrap-up [ID:nN28167458]. "U.S. data today is not really that good for risk trades,"said Vassili Serebriakov, senior currency strategist at WellsFargo in New York. "So we have seen equities lower." 800 POUND GORILLA Analysts said the downgrade of Spain was largely expected,though the timing caught the market by surprise. "We see multiple downgrades ahead for Spain," BBH's Thinsaid. "Indeed, Spain is the 800-pound gorilla in the room.Greece and Portugal are small countries, but Spain is aboutfive times their size with regards to GDP." Spain's head of Treasury said the country's sovereign debtrating was still high despite the Fitch downgrade.[ID:nMDT009070] A $1 trillion safety net set up by European officialsearlier this month to ward off the adverse effects fromGreece's debt problems and the announcements of new austeritymeasures from Spain and Portugal have failed to brake theeuro's decline. Analysts said concerns about the euro zone's debt troublesremain entrenched. Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global FX strategyat BNY Mellon in Boston, said there has been a lot ofshort-term borrowing by European governments in the past twoyears with an average maturity of less than two years. As a result, refinancing will be a big risk. "That's goingto be a constant test as far as market sentiment is concerned,"he said.
