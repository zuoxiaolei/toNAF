<raw><![CDATA[ * No grounds yet for suit on China rare earth export curbs * EU trade chief wants interim rare earths deal with China * Chinese subsidies in focus as EU confronts rising imports * Warns any "green" border tax could trigger "trade war"  BRUSSELS, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The EU trade chief said onWednesday he would press China for assurances on rare earthsupplies in talks next month, though there was no conclusiveevidence Chinese limits on such exports had hit Europeanindustry. The European Union is struggling to secure supplies of rareearth minerals, which are used in the production of high-techgoods and defence products, and has said it could take legalaction against China for cutting down on exports. "If need be, we will certainly go to the WTO but ... up tonow there is no conclusive evidence that our European businessesare hampered by this," European Trade Commissioner Karel DeGucht told Reuters in an interview. "It's better to come to a negotiated agreement whereby theinterim is covered by clear arrangements ... instead of gettinginto a fight."  SUBSIDIES De Gucht said Europe was paying close attention to Chinesestate subsidies as the EU looks for new ways of deal with cheapimports that hurt its producers. Chinese imports are set to boomin 2016, when the EU recognises China as a market economy. "We are focusing more and more on subsidisation ... Theysubsidise nearly everything," he said. "We are going to becomemuch more precise in reacting to that kind of practice." But De Gucht rejected calls for an EU import tax on goodsmade under less stringent environmental conditions than in theEU, saying that would pose the risk of multiple legal suits. France and Germany have said a "green" border tax iscritical for securing the competitiveness of EU producersburdened by environmental rules that add to their costs. "I fear very much that (a border tax) could end up in atrade war. I'm certainly not in favour of this," he said. The EU executive Commission has no current plans to draftsuch a tariff, but might have to reconsider if other majortrading or economic blocs took such a step, De Gucht said.
