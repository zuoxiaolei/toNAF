<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The number of home purchase loans approved by banks in Britain fell unexpectedly on a monthly basis in January, but the figure was almost 40% up from a year ago, the British Bankers' Association said on Tuesday.  The association said 35,083 mortgage applications were approved during the month, down from the 45,650 loans approved in December but up 37.8% from a year ago. Economists had expected the number to drop only to 45,300.  The group also revised December's figure down from 45,900.  January's figure, which was the lowest since May 2009, came after a tax exemption on properties worth up to GBP 175,000 expired on Dec. 31.  According to the association, the monthly decline was due in part to a slowdown of activity following a rush at the end of the year as homebuyers hurried to take advantage of the exemption.  David Dooks, the group's director of statistics, said in a statement: "It was no surprise to see the January mortgage figures falling back from December, when transactions were being pushed through to beat the end of stamp duty relief."  Nonetheless, the pound plummeted against the U.S. dollar, yen and euro in the aftermath of the data: GBP/USD dropped 0.41% to hit 1.5418, GBP/JPY shed 0.64% to hit 140.21 and EUR/GBP surged 0.59% to hit 0.8834.             ]]></raw>
