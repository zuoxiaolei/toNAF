Separately, expectations that the Federal Reserve will announce further easing measures at the conclusion of Wednesdayâ€™s policy meeting continued to weigh on dollar demand.Investors were also awaiting fresh developments in negotiations to avoid the U.S. fiscal cliff amid concerns that the automatic tax hikes and spending cuts due to take effect in early 2013 could derail the U.S. recovery.  The Aussie was lower against the euro with EUR/AUD adding 0.13%, to hit 1.2355. Later in the day, the ZEW Institute of Economic Research was to release its closely watched index of German economic sentiment, while the U.S. was to publish official data on the trade balance.             ]]></raw>
