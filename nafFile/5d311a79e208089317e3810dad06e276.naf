<raw><![CDATA[ (Corrects paragraph 12 to show recent upper range of U.S.dollar vs Canadian was C$1.0160, not C$1.0560) * C$ hits session low of 97.54 U.S. cents * Canadian bond prices higher across curve (Updates to afternoon; adds details, commentary) By Claire Sibonney TORONTO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar shed morethan a cent against the greenback on Tuesday, hitting itslowest level in nearly three weeks, as commodity prices andequity markets slumped and weak domestic data fueled concernsabout economic growth. The currency  fell as low as C$1.0252 to the U.S.dollar, or 97.54 U.S. cents, by late morning, its weakest levelsince Oct. 28. North American equities sold off hard amid festeringworries over fiscal tightening in China and euro zone debtlevels. [.N] [.TO] Prices for key Canadian commodities, such as oil, basemetals and gold, were also down sharply as the U.S. dollarcontinued to strengthen on rising risk aversion. [O/R] [MET/L][GOl] FRX/] "I don't think there's been one particular trigger forthis," said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TDSecurities. "What we saw last week was very definitely another ramp-upin speculative risk positions, long Canadian dollar positions,which I would imagine ... would have been unwound over thecourse of the past couple days as the Canadian dollar hasstrengthened." Osborne noted that talk of larger investors "starting totidy up positions" and perhaps liquidating some riskier assetsahead of the year-end, may signal a new short-term trend. Adding extra pressure on Canada's currency, domesticmanufacturing sales were in September, as expected, pressuredby weak auto production, a strong currency and sagging exports,which are all putting the brakes on economic growth.[ID:nN1699569] The Canadian dollar was already an underperformer beforethe figures came out in early morning, but Osborne said it didhave a modest impact and probably encouraged a little moreselling. "Softer data from Canada this morning which we can't reallyignore either ... does suggest that the second half of the yeardoes appear to be gearing down quite significantly compared tovery strong growth in the first half of the year for Canada." At 12:33 p.m. (1733 GMT), the Canadian dollar   wasat C$1.0244 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.62 U.S. cents, downsharply from C$1.0089 to the U.S. dollar, or 99.12 U.S. cents,at Monday's close. The session saw a break in a recent short-term range forthe U.S. dollar versus the Canadian currency of around C$0.9980to C$1.0160, with parity constituting a very strong recentsupport level for the greenback. The next key barrier for the U.S. dollar against Canadalies near the 100- and 200-day moving averages around C$1.03.Osborne said a break of that area could take the Canadiancurrency back to around C$1.0650, to weakness last seen inAugust. Canadian bond prices rebounded on Tuesday, as renewed riskaversion and the soft Canadian data saw investors flock to thesafety of government debt. The two-year bond  rose 10 Canadian cents toyield 1.585 percent, while the 10-year bond  gained40 Canadian cents to yield 3.097 percent.
