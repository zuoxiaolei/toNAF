<raw><![CDATA[ LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew fasterthan originally estimated in the second quarter of this year,hitting its fastest rate of growth in more than nine years,official data showed on Friday. The Office for National Statistics said the economy grew by1.2 percent in the three months to June, up from its preliminaryestimate of 1.1 percent, after construction output provedstronger than first thought. Analysts had expected no revision. On the year, the economy grew 1.7 percent in the secondquarter -- 0.1 percentage points higher than the ONS's firstestimate and economists' forecasts.   The economy grew 0.3 percent in the first three months ofthe year.  The figures provide further evidence that Britain's economicrecovery accelerated sharply during the first half of the yearbut economists are concerned that a weakening global economy andlooming UK government spending cuts will sap growth in 2011. Revised construction output figures were published earlierin the month and the ONS had said these could add 0.1 percentagepoints to GDP. Household expenditure rose 0.7 percent on the quarter and1.0 percent on the year, the ONS said. That was the biggestquarterly rise since Q1 2008 and comes after a 0.1 percent fallin the first quarter.                ]]></raw>
