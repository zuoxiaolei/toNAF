<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The pound was trading close to an eight-day low against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, after official data showed that Britain's economy suffered a shock 0.5% contraction in the last three months of 2010.GBP/USD hit 1.5752 during European late afternoon trade, the pair’s lowest since January 13; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.5771, tumbling 1.32%.The pair was likely to find short-term support 1.5717, the low of January 13 and resistance at 1.6016, the day’s high.The Office for National Statistics said the U.K. economy contracted by 0.5%, after expanding by 0.7% in the previous quarter, confounding expectations for a 0.5% increase as Britain's coldest December in a century took a far harsher toll than economists had forecast.Construction and service sector output, major components of the economy, posted large monthly falls but the report said that even without the disruption from snow the economy would have struggled to register any growth in the quarter.A separate report showed that Britain's public-sector net borrowing rose from a year ago to its highest December reading on record, though it fell from the all-time record reached in November.Public sector net borrowing came in at GBP15.3 billion in December, below the GBP18.1 billion forecast but above December 2009's total of GBP14.3 billion.The pound was also sharply lower against the euro, with EUR/GBP jumping 1.12% to hit 0.8625.Also Tuesday, the S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. home price index fell more-than-expected in November, declining for the fifth consecutive month while a separate report showed that U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly jumped to an eight-month high in January.             ]]></raw>
