<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro held steady against the yen on Tuesday, paring back earlier gains stemming from reports the IMF and the EU have agreed on debt-reduction targets for Greece, which will open the flow of aid into the country. In Asian trading on Tuesday, EUR/JPY hit 106.47, down 0.02% and up from a low of 106.19 and off a high of 106.77.The pair sought to test support at 105.72, Friday's low, and resistance at 107.13, Monday's high.The pair shot up earlier on news that Greece's EU and IMF creditors agreed to reduce the country's debt-reduction target by EUR40 billion to 124% of gross domestic product by 2020, an accord needed to free up aid.The euro jumped up on the news, though the single currency later pared back earlier gains despite welcome news Greece will trim debt burdens down further to 110% by 2022, as the market had already priced in a deal being pushed through. Furthermore, eurozone and IMF policymakers agreed to trim interest rates on Greek loans, extend their maturity by 15-30 years, and grant the country a 10-year interest repayment deferral.Elsewhere, the euro was flat against the pound and flat against the Canadian dollar, with EUR/GBP unchanged at 0.8094 and EUR/CAD trading down 0.01% at 1.2888.Later Tuesday in Europe, Switzerland is to publish an index of leading economic indicators, which serves as a weather vane for the economy's direction.             ]]></raw>
