<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds detail) By Jan Strupczewski and Silke Koltrowitz BRUSSELS/KEHRSATZ, Switzerland Sept 15 (Reuters) - TheEuropean Union gave some support on Wednesday to Japan'sintervention to weaken the rising yen but said such action wouldhave had more impact if had it been coordinated with others. "Unilateral actions are not the appropriate way to deal withglobal imbalances," Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker, on atrip to Switzerland, said when asked about the Bank of Japan'saction. Japan sold yen in the market on Wednesday for the first timein six years and promised more to come in a bid to stop thecurrency's relentless rise from hurting exporters andthreatening a fragile economic recovery. The yen had surged to its highest against the dollar since1995, as low U.S. interest rates have made the dollar cheap toborrow and swap for higher-yielding assets and as talk hasresurfaced that the Fed might loosen policy further. Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda, who will reportedly keephis post after a cabinet reshuffle, indicated Tokyo acted aloneon the yen. He said he was in contact with authorities overseas. But an EU source said Japan had not even informed theEuropeans, or the United States, about the intervention. Euro zone sources said earlier this month that there hadbeen no discussions of European support for a potentialintervention by Japan, a clear signal that coordinated helpwould not have been forthcoming. The European Commission -- the bloc's executive -- echoedJuncker's line. "We are of the opinion that coordinated interventions are tobe preferred, as past experience has shown that these arenotably more effective than uncoordinated interventions,"Commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said in Brussels.  But he added that exchange rates out of line withfundamentals could pose problems to stability. "Excess exchange rate volatility and exchange rates that arenot in line with  fundamentals may have adverse implications foreconomic and financial stability," Altafaj said. "DespiteJapan's ongoing current account surplus, a too rapid yenappreciation could pose challenges to the recovery." The Commission said Japan could have equally well usedmonetary policy instruments rather than a currency intervention. "Monetary policy measures are at least as likely to have animpact on the yen strength and on deflation as interventions inthe currency market," Altafaj said. The U.S. dollar was boosted further after an official atJapan's Ministry of Finance said intervention was not finished.It climbed about 3 percent on the day to more than 85.50 yen,having dropped to a 15-year low of 82.87 yen earlier.
