<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro shot up against the yen in U.S. trading on Friday on news the European Union took concrete steps to loosen credit conditions in countries like Spain and contain the debt crisis as well. In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/JPY hit 101.08, up 2.23%, up from a low of 98.54 and off a high of 101.39.The pair sought to test support at 98.54, the earlier low, and resistance at 101.39, the earlier high.A string of European Union summit decisions served as the pair's primary steering currents on Friday.European Union leaders earlier gave the green light for rescue funds to stabilize bond markets without forcing countries in compliance with E.U. budget rules to take on added austerity measures.E.U. officials also allowed the continent's bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, to directly recapitalize banks, which won't add to overall national debt burdens since the money will go straight to banks and bypass sovereign books when needed.E.U. policymakers also agreed to launch a supervisory organization for eurozone banks by the end of this year.The news surprised investors, who were worried the summit would produce statements of good intentions but little in terms of concrete policies.Yields on Spanish and Italian government debt fell on the news, further buoying the euro.Meanwhile, the eurozone' preliminary consumer price index held steady at a 16-month low of 2.4% in June, in line with expectations.German retail sales fell in May, dipping 0.3% after a 0.2% decline the previous month, much weaker than market calls for retail sales to rise 0.1% in May. Meanwhile in Japan, housing starts grew 9.3% in May compared with the same month a year earlier, far outpacing market calls for a gain of 6.7%.Tepid data out of the U.S. further fueled the global risk-on trading session, which sent safe-haven currencies like the yen and the dollar falling.The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported earlier that personal spending remained unchanged at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.0% in May, slightly off from market calls for a gain of 0.1%Meanwhile, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of consumer sentiment fell to 73.2 in June from a final reading of 79.3 in May.Analysts had forecast a 74.1 reading.The euro, meanwhile, was up against the pound and up against the Canadian dollar, with EUR/GBP trading up 0.59%  at 0.8066 and EUR/CAD up 0.21% and trading at 1.2882.             ]]></raw>
