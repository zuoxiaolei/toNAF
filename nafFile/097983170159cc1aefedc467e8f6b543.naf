<raw><![CDATA[ * Unions threaten public service "total shut-down" * Govt keen to avoid repeat of 2007 mass walkout  By Ed Cropley JOHANNESBURG, Aug 10 (Reuters) - South Africa is braced fora major public sector workers strike on Tuesday, with unionsrepresenting more than a million civil servants backing aone-day walkout to demand higher pay. Marches are planned for Cape Town and Pretoria, SouthAfrica's administrative capital, as part of a "total shut-downof the public service", according to powerful labourconfederation COSATU. Everything from schools to public offices to immigrationcentres are expected to be affected, although essential servicessuch as police and hospitals are likely to run on a skeletonstaff. COSATU and its member unions have threatened to drag theindustrial action beyond Tuesday if government does not meet itsdemands of an 8.6 percent pay hike -- twice the current rate ofinflation -- and a 1,000 rand ($139) monthly housing stipend. The government is offering 7 percent and 630 rand forhousing, although analysts believe it is likely to raise itsoffer rather than risk a repeat of a prolonged 2007 civilservice walk-out that hit the economy. "There is a very strong possibility that by the end of theweek, we will be embarking on a larger strike," said SizwePamla, spokesman for NEHAWU, one of the COSATU unions. The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has along-standing alliance with unions forged in the struggleagainst apartheid and has tended to acquiesce to worker demandsto maintain relations with its governing partner. However, the latest union wage bids, which the governmentsays combine to a 9 percent increase, are likely to put pressureon the budget and make it very hard to bring the deficit downfrom 6.7 percent of GDP without spending cutbacks elsewhere. Spending on personnel is the largest sector of the budget. The central bank has also expressed concern about elevatedpay increases stoking inflation in the wider economy, puttingupward pressure on interest rates.
