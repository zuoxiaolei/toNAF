<raw><![CDATA[ * PM sticks to June deadline on U.S.-led trade initiative	 * Calls for stronger U.S. ties, tighter ties with Asia	 * Reiterates concern over China's military build-up	 * Voices concern over regional maritime disputes 	 	 (Adds Kan comments on maritime rows) 	  By Chisa Fujioka	 TOKYO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Naoto Kanrenewed his commitment on Thursday to open up Japan's market tocapitalise on overseas growth and stuck to a June deadline todecide whether to join a U.S.-led free trade initiative.	 In a foreign policy speech, Kan also reaffirmed theimportance of the U.S. military presence in Japan given regionaltensions including over North Korea's nuclear programme.	 While stressing the need for stronger relations with theUnited States, he called for tighter ties with Asian neighbourssuch as China but reiterated Japan's concern over China'smilitary build-up.	 Kan has come under fire from domestic critics for not havinga coherent diplomatic strategy and mishandling territorial rowswith China and Russia. Ties with ally Washington frayed underhis predecessor due to a dispute over a U.S. Marines airbase.	 On trade, Kan said he wanted to press ahead with studiesinto the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a U.S.-led free tradeinitiative. Many Japanese businesses are keen to join the TPP,but powerful farming lobbies have resisted.	 "When my cabinet was formed last June, I felt it wasnecessary to restore an energetic Japan and to break a sense ofdeadlock that has continued for nearly 20 years," he said in thespeech.	 "The key is to open up the country, both in terms ofthinking and of the economy."	  The TPP started as a trade pact between Singapore, NewZealand, Chile and Brunei, who have since been joined in talksby Australia, Peru, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the United States.	 Adding Japan's $5 trillion economy would greatly increasethe potential market-opening gains of the proposed pact.	 But it could also complicate the negotiations, since Tokyowould not only have to free up agriculture but address U.S.concerns that planned postal system reforms will hurt privatecompetitors in the insurance, banking and express deliverysectors.	 Japan's previous trade deals have left out the heavilyprotected farm sector, which holds considerable political cloutdue to an electoral system that places a greater weight on ruralvotes.	 Kan expressed his concern about growing regional rowsover maritime resources, and said Japan is ready to play a keyrole in keeping further disputes from occurring. 	 "Waters in the Asia-Pacific area are the source ofwealth for the whole region. But it should not be overlookedthat disputes surrounding rights to maritime resources haveemerged in recent years as a destabilising factor," Kansaid. 	 "We aim to play a leadership role in setting up newmaritime rules to prevent new disputes and keep the waters inthe region as the ocean of peace." 	 China has warned its neighbours to stay off disputedislands in the South China Sea, declaring it holds "indisputablesovereignty" over the waters. 	   Sino-Japanese relationsdeteriorated sharply after September, when Japan detained aChinese skipper whose trawler collided with Japanese patrolboats near a chain of disputed islands in the East China Sea,called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. 	 The inhabited islands are thought to lie near potentialoil and gas reserves in an area rich with fish.
