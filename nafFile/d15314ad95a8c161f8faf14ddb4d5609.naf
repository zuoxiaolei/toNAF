<raw><![CDATA[ LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Britain's economy contracted byslightly less in the final three months of 2010 thanstatisticians had earlier estimated, due to broad-based upwardrevisions to a range of sectors.  The Office for National Statistics revised fourth-quarterGDP growth upwards  to -0.5 percent on the quarter from its mostrecent previous estimate of -0.6 percent, though the new figureis still the biggest decline since the second quarter of 2009. The annual rate of growth was unrevised at 1.5 percent.Economists had expected both rates to remain unrevised at -0.6percent and 1.5 percent respectively. The ONS said that Britain's coldest December in 100 yearshad knocked 0.5 percentage points off GDP, and that growth wouldhave been flat without the adverse weather. The services sector and the construction sector bothsuffered their biggest contractions since the second quarter of2009, when Britain's economy was deep in recession. House holdexpenditure also suffered its biggest fall since then. However, industrial output grew at its fastest pace sincethe second quarter of 2010.             ]]></raw>
