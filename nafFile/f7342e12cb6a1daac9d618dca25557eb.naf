<raw><![CDATA[ (For more stories on the Japanese economy, click) * USD/JPY hits three-week low on Fed bond purchase outlook * Japan intervened in September for first time in six years * A strong yen threatens Japan exports, corporate earnings (Adds details, direct quote) By Stanley White TOKYO, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Japan's finance minister warned onTuesday against further yen gains as signs that the U.S. FederalReserve could increase bond purchases and disappointing data onthe U.S. labour market weigh on the dollar. It is "certainly possible" the Fed could end up buying morethan its initially announced target of $600 billion in governmentbonds, Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Sunday, as the U.S. economystruggles to pick up enough pace to create new jobs. Bernanke's comments have put a dent in the dollar and helpedpush bond yields lower globally. Should the yen continue to riseversus the greenback, it could leave Japan in an awkward positionafter it intervened in September to prevent a strong currencyfrom harming its economic recovery. "Since yesterday, there have been some one-sided moves,"Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said at a briefing. "I will continue to pay close attention to the markets. I'mnot in a position to comment about specific monetary policy movesin other countries." The dollar slipped to a three-week low below 82.52 yenearlier on Tuesday in Tokyo trade. Japan sold 2.1249 trillion yen ($25.69 billion) on one day inSeptember, finance ministry data shows, as Japanese authoritiesintervened for the first time in six years as the yen surged to15-year highs against the dollar. Japan has stayed out of the currency market since then,according to finance ministry data. On domestic tax policy, Noda told reporters after a cabinetmeeting that the government should not issue bonds to coverrevenue lost from lowering the corporate tax burden. He also said he could not decide now by how much thecorporate tax burden should be reduced The government is on course to compile its tax policy forfiscal 2011/12, which will serve as a base for drafting nextfiscal year's budget due at the end of the month.
