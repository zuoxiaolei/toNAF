<raw><![CDATA[ KIEV, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Ukraine's Viktor Yanukovich,opposition leader who won Sunday's presidential election, saidUkraine needed financial help from both the East and the Westand should renegotiate its debts.In his first policy statement since the vote, Yanukovichcalled on his election rival Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko toquit so he could start forming a new government and said tieswith Russia and other former Soviet states would be a priority. Ukraine's economy is one of Europe's worst performing in thepast year -- contracting by up to 15 percent -- and investorshave feared that the country could default on debt payments. "We need help from the West and the East in stabilising theeconomic situation and restructuring financial obligations," hesaid in a statement. He ordered a new government to "go to our creditors, ourneighbours, economically developed countries with the aim toreach agreements and direct help to solve the economic crisis". He did not say which obligations he meant. Some of thepayments that have been difficult for Ukraine in the past yearhave been sovereign and quasi-sovereign Eurobonds, domesticT-bills and payments for Russian gas. Yanukovich also made no direct reference to theInternational Monetary Fund, which suspended a $16.4 billionbailout programme at the end of last year but whose aid had beenvital in propping up the state's finances in 2009.
