<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The U.S. dollar closed the week slightly higher against the Swiss franc on Friday, but remained close to what Swiss National Bank Chairman Philipp Hildebrand called “extreme levels” amid concerns over the U.S. economic recovery.USD/CHF hit 0.8346 on Tuesday, the pair’s lowest since June 8; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.8479 by close of trade on Friday, rising 0.60% over the week.The pair is likely to find support at 0.8325, the low of June 7 and the pair's all-time low and resistance at 0.8550, Wednesday’s high and an almost three-week high.On Thursday, the SNB said it was keeping its key interest rate and 2011 growth forecast unchanged, highlighting concerns over the strengthening Swiss franc. "Since the Swiss franc also recorded historic exchange rates against other currencies, its value, on a real and trade-weighted basis, is now well above its long term level," Hildebrand said. This has led to "strong price competition" for the Swiss export industry.The central bank maintained its forecast for growth at 2.0% due to "robust foreign demand." The central bank also held monetary policy steady, holding its three-month Libor rate at 0.0 to 0.75%.Meanwhile, the Swissie advanced to a record high against the euro on Thursday, before paring gains by the week’s end as risk aversion remained elevated amid concerns over Greece’s sovereign debt crisis.In the week ahead, the Federal Reserve is to hold its policy setting meeting, which will be followed by a closely watched press conference by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. Investors are hoping that Bernanke will shed some light on the banks view of the need for further monetary easing.
