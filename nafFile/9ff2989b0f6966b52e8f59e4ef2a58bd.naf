<raw><![CDATA[   * C$ ends at C$1.0254, or 97.52 U.S. cents. * BoC's Carney: Don't take rate hike for granted * Bond prices firmer across the curve (Updates to close, adds quotes) By Jennifer Kwan TORONTO, June 16 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar fell froma one-month high against the U.S. currency on Wednesday toclose slightly lower as stock markets and investor appetite forrisk lost steam late in the session. The Canadian dollar earlier touched C$1.0224 to the U.S.dollar, or 97.81 U.S. cents, its best level since May 14,strongly supported by higher oil prices. [O/R] But choppiness in equity markets, which saw Toronto'sresource-heavy index barely close with gains, helped drag thecurrency lower. [.TO] [.N] "Stocks were in positive territory for a while and theyjust eased off. That's put a little bit of pressure on Canada,"said Steve Butler, director of foreign exchange trading atScotia Capital. The market largely shrugged off comments by Bank of CanadaGovernor Mark Carney in a speech and press conference in PrinceEdward Island. The head of the central bank cautioned markets not to takeanother interest rate hike for granted, saying volatile globalconditions mean no particular path for monetary policy ispreordained. [ID:nN16164000] "I don't know if he gave us anything that could cement aview one way or the other," said Butler, but added: "I do thinkwe will see another rate hike in July." The central bank raised its key rate by a quarter point onJune 1 to 0.5 percent, becoming the first central bank in theGroup of Seven wealthy countries to do so. Markets are pricingin a second rate hike on July 20. [BOCWATCH] The Canadian currency finished at C$1.0254 to the U.S.dollar, or 97.52 U.S. cents, down slightly from C$1.0251, or97.55 U.S. cents, at Tuesday's close. Earlier, the currency got much of its lift from a move inthe oil price to above $77 a barrel, said Matthew Strauss,senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets. The rise wasalso facilitated by the currency's ability to punch through keytechnical levels. Carney's speech offered "nothing really new or no newinsight into monetary policy thinking from the Bank of Canadaperspective," Strauss said, adding it "provided no direction"for the Canadian dollar. Strauss said the next key technical levels for the currencyare C$1.0225 to the U.S. dollar and C$1.0111. On the top side,analysts would be eyeing C$1.0328. BONDS HIGHER; CANADA HOLDS 'GOOD AUCTION' Canadian bond prices rose across the curve, tracking U.S.Treasury issues, which benefited from a report showing U.S.housing starts in May fell more than expected to a five-monthlow. [US/] The two-year government bond  rose 9.5 Canadiancents to yield 1.777 percent, while the 10-year bond rose 55 Canadian cents to yield 3.363 percent. Canadian bonds outperformed U.S. treasuries. The Canadian10-year bond yield was 9.7 basis points above its U.S.counterpart, compared with 12 basis points on Tuesday. The Bank of Canada said on Wednesday its C$3 billionauction of 2.5 percent Government of Canada bonds due Sept. 1,2013 produced an average yield of 2.393 percent. [CA/AUC] Bids from primary dealers totaled C$7.296 billion,resulting in a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.43. The ratio is ameasure of investor demand and a reading above 2 generallyindicates a solid auction. "(There was) fairly decent demand. It was a good auction,"said Sheldon Dong, fixed income analyst at TD WaterhousePrivate Investment. "The global financial markets are still pretty muchunsettled so there is still a flight to quality. So short-termdebt is a good way to park your money." (With additional writing by Jeffrey Hodgson)             ]]></raw>
