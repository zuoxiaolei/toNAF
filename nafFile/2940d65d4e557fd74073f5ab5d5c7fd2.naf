<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar was lower against the Swiss franc on Friday, retreating from a one-week high after weaker-than-forecast U.S. jobs data dampened expectations that the Federal Reserve will start to unwind its stimulus program by the year's end.USD/CHF hit session highs of 0.9390, the strongest level since July 25, before turning lower to settle at 0.9294, down 0.76% for the day.The pair is likely to find support at 0.9252, Thursday’s low and resistance at 0.9390, Friday’s high.The Department of Labor said the U.S. economy added 162,000 jobs in July, less than the 184,000 increase forecast by economists. June's figure was revised down to 188,000 from a previously reported 195,000. The unemployment rate ticked down to 7.4% from 7.6% in June, due in part to more people leaving the labor force.The data came amid growing uncertainty over the future of the U.S. central bank’s stimulus program, after the Fed said on Wednesday that it would keep buying USD85 billion a month in mortgage and Treasury securities and gave no hint of plans to taper its bond-buying program.The Swissie was also supported after data showed that the SVME PMI jumped to 57.4 in July, from a reading of 51.9 the previous month, the highest level since June 2011. Analysts had expected the index to rise to 52.5 last month.Despite Friday’s losses, the greenback still ended the week with a gain of 0.1% against the Swissie, following the release of upbeat U.S. economic data released earlier in the week.The U.S. Department of Labor said on Thursday that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits fell by 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 326,000 last week, the lowest level since January 2008.Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of purchasing managers rose to 55.4 in July, the highest level since April 2011 and up from a reading of 50.9 in June. The robust data came after the Commerce Department said on Wednesday that gross domestic product grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.7% in the three months to June, beating expectations for growth of 1%. That followed a report from payroll processing firm ADP, which said non-farm private employment rose by a seasonally adjusted 200,000 in July, above expectations for an increase of 180,000. In the week ahead, the U.S. is to publish data on service sector activity as well as a report on the trade balance. Investors have closely been looking out for U.S. data reports recently to gauge if they will strengthen or weaken the case for the Fed to reduce its bond purchases.Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.
