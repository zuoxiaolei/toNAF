<raw><![CDATA[ March 23 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organisation is toissue a confidential ruling on Tuesday to the United States andEuropean Union in the case brought by Washington over subsidiesfor EADS subsidiary Airbus. But the ruling does not mark the end of the case, launchedby the United States in October 2004. The prospect of tradesanctions, if ever approved, is still far off and there are manyopportunities for appeals and other legal moves before thedispute is settled.  The next major deadline will come in about 3 months, whenthe WTO issues an interim confidential ruling in thecounter-suit brought by the EU against the United States oversubsidies for Boeing. When the legal outcome in both cases is emerging, the twosides may decide to end the litigation and negotiate asettlement. Boeing and U.S. officials insist the two cases areseparate and Tuesday's ruling will force the EU to desist fromsubsidising Airbus. Otherwise, this is how the WTO legal system works:   CONSULTATIONS A country launches a trade dispute by seeking formalconsultations with another country over the issue. These last 60days, longer if the two parties wish, after which the plaintiffcan request the creation of a panel of judges -- legal and tradeexperts -- to rule on the dispute. In this case theconsultations lasted 8 months.   PANEL The panel is requested at a meeting of the WTO's disputesettlement body (DSB), held once a month.  The defendant can reject the first request, but it goesthrough automatically on the second request unless all WTOmembers including the plaintiff agree to block it.  In this case the United States requested a panel in May2005, the EU rejected it at a DSB meeting in June, and it wasfinally set up in July 2005.  The parties must agree to the three judges on the panel. Ifnot they can ask the WTO director-general to select them. The United States asked the director-general to do that inOctober 2005, and the panel was formed later that month.   THE RULING WTO panels aim to issue a confidential interim report to theparties within 3-5 months of appointment. A final confidentialreport is issued to the parties up to 6 months after that. Thereis rarely any substantive difference between the two. Once the final report has been translated several weekslater, it is circulated to all members and published. The WTOaims to publish a report 6-9 months after a panel is formed, butin complex cases this can take much longer. In this case the panel advised the WTO in April 2006 that itcould not complete its work within 6 months. The ruling has beendelayed repeatedly since then. It is this confidential, finalruling that was issued to the parties on Tuesday.   THE APPEAL  Once the final ruling has been fully published, it will beadopted by the WTO within 60 days, at the next meeting of theDSB. If necessary, the plaintiff will call a special meeting ofthe DSB to adopt the report.  However, within those 60 days, either party can appeal. Forcases involving subsidies, as in this one, the deadline forappeal is 30 days. The appeal -- looking at whether the original panel observedtrade law in coming to its decision, rather than re-examiningthe facts of the case -- is heard by three members drawn fromthe WTO's seven-member Appellate Body of trade law experts.  They must deliver their ruling -- upholding or overturningall or part of the original panel's findings -- within 90 days.There is an accelerated timetable for appeals of 60 days incases involving "prohibited" subsidies linked to exports. WTO members must accept or reject the appeal ruling within30 days, at a meeting of the DSB. It can only be rejected byconsensus -- that is with no member objecting to the rejection.   COMPLIANCE  If the panel or appellate body have found against thedefendant, they generally recommend that it should bring itstrade practice in line with WTO rules. Once the WTO has adoptedthe original panel or appeal ruling at the DSB, the respondenthas a "reasonable period of time" to make these changes andconform with the rules, which may be agreed by arbitration.  In the case of prohibited subsidies the panel may set adeadline typically of several months for the subsidies to behalted. In the case of "actionable" subsidies that injure theplaintiff the defendant has six months to withdraw it.  COMPLIANCE DISPUTES If the plaintiff believes the defendant has failed to complywith the ruling in the reasonable period of time or by thedeadline, it can launch another dispute to determine compliance. This involves the same process of consultations, panel andappeal. But it works to a tighter time-frame, with the panelusually delivering a ruling within 90 days.   SANCTIONS  An appeal to a compliance dispute is the end of the line.Now the plaintiff can seek retaliation to compensate it for thelosses it has suffered by the respondent's illegal behaviour,until the respondent implements the ruling.  This could involve a retaliatory increase in tariffs in theproduct concerned or similar goods, or "cross-retaliation" inanother area, for instance lifting copyright or protection ofintellectual property rights for goods like software of music.  The two sides may agree on compensation, or they may go toarbitration over the size and scope of retaliation. Thearbitrator should deliver a decision within 60 days.
