<raw><![CDATA[ * C.bank seen shifting rouble's floating band to 34.75 * Tax bills, strong crude prices to support rouble this week * But rally seen reaching "ceiling"   (Adds detail) By Lidia Kelly MOSCOW, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble extended itsgains on Wednesday, disregarding the latest rate cut and forcingthe central bank to intervene, but analysts said the rally mayrun out of steam once month-end tax payments are over. In a fifth such move since last week, the central bank movedthe floating rouble band boundary to 34.75 versus thedollar-euro basket from 34.80 , after buying $700million of foreign currency, local dealers said. The central bank shifts the boundaries of the floatingrouble corridor by 5 kopecks for each $700 million in purchases,making the rouble's rise less rapid. At 1240 GMT the rouble traded at 34.82 versus the basket,after strengthening earlier in the session as far as 34.78 --its strongest since December 2009. Monthly tax payments, which come due this week -- estimatedto possibly demand as much as 500 billion roubles ($16.66billion) -- along with oil prices hovering around $78-$79 abarrel [O/R], have been pushing the rouble higher. "The pressure on the central bank bid level is likely topersist this week," Nikolai Podguzov, the head of fixed incomestrategy at Renaissance Capital, said in a note.  The rouble's firming came despite the central bankengineering yet another gradual rate cut, effective as ofWednesday, which brings the benchmark refinancing rate to arecord low at 8.50 percent. [ID:nLDE61I0H8] RALLY TO EASE The rouble's recent wave of appreciation has been mostpronounced against the globally weakening euro, against which itrose to its strongest since late 2008 last week . Versus the dollar, the rouble has held broadly stable,trading at 30.02 per dollar  on Wednesday. For many investors and ordinary Russians alike the rouble'sposition versus the dollar remains the most telling indicator ofthe currency's might. In the medium term, investors see the rouble changing verylittle against the dollar, with 1-year non-deliverable forward(NDF) contracts -- a barometer of investors' sentiment towardsthe currency -- showing the rouble at 31.10 . UniCredit reckons the rouble is also already "knocking onthe ceiling," attributing the current rally partly to the taxpayment demands and seasonal improvement in the budget balance. The budget showed a weak surplus in January, but is expectedto swing back to deficit this month as state spending increases. "The rally has been driven by forces which are short-term innature and so should start to ease and then reverse within a fewweeks or even days," Vladimir Osakovsky, UniCredit's economistwrote in a note.
