<raw><![CDATA[ BUDAPEST, Oct 22 (Reuters) - A lawmaker of Hungary's rulingFidesz party submitted a bill to parliament on Friday to allowcitizens to return into the state pension system from privatefunds established in a 1997 reform. Gabriella Selmeczi, the government's pension commissioner,proposed in the bill that returnees should move their savings inprivate funds into the state system in an unchanged compositionof assets. "(The bill) does not require the transfer in cash -- that isa forced sale of the assets prior to the return -- so as toprotect capital markets," she said in the motion published onparliament's www.mkogy.hu website. The legislation will open up the possibility of returninginto the state pension scheme until Dec. 31, 2011. It will alsoabolish mandatory entry into a private pension fund for careerstarters.
