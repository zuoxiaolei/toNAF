<raw><![CDATA[ * Brent, U.S. crude rally on Greece bets, weaker dollar * Optimism grows Greek parliament will approve measures * Treasuries extend losses after 5-year note auction (Updates prices, adds Nikkei futures, revises comment) By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - World stocks jumped about 1percent and the euro rallied on Tuesday on hopes an impendingvote on Greece's budget and a France-led plan to roll overGreek debt will save Greece from what would be the firstsovereign default in the euro zone. As investors flocked to riskier assets like equities andcommodities, the Treasury's five-year note auction faced lowerdemand, which sent U.S. debt prices slumping. European and U.S. stocks rose as optimism grew that theGreek parliament would adopt a fiscal austerity plan needed inexchange for critical financial aid from international lenders,despite violent street protests in Athens. For details, see[ID:nL6E7HS2BG] "The negative reaction that you're getting from the publicis a sign that the parliament is likely to vote in favor of theausterity plan," said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist atCantor Fitzgerald & Co in San Francisco. In Athens, hooded youths throwing stones and wieldingsticks set fire to garbage bins and a telecoms truck outsideParliament and riot police fired tear gas to disperse them asthe Parliament prepared to vote on Wednesday and Thursday onthe controversial austerity plan. Trade unions began a 48-hourstrike against the EU/IMF-imposed measures. [ID:nLDE75R0FD] On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 130.75 points, or 1.09 percent, to 12,174.31. The S&P 500 gained 14.66 points, or 1.15 percent, to 1,294.76. TheNasdaq Composite  added 36.76 points, or 1.37 percent,to 2,725.04. World shares as measured by MSCI's all-country world index gained 1 percent, while in Europe theFTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares closed0.56 percent higher. U.S. dollar denominated Nikkei futures rose 0.8 percent. The news from Europe lifted the euro against the U.S.dollar as it reduced the chances of the first sovereign defaultin the 17-member euro zone. Gains, however, are expected to belimited as Greece's access to bailout funds may only delay aneventual default given the size its debt burden, analystssaid. "We are getting more and more bearish on the euro giventhere are larger issues at stake here apart from the Greekausterity vote," said Neal Mellor, currency strategist at Bankof New York Mellon. Hopes on the Greek resolution and the weaker greenbackboosted commodity prices, including crude oil. ICE Brent crudefor August  settled up $2.79 at $108.78 a barrel. U.S.crude  added $2.28 to settle at $92.89 a barrel. Copper  gained 0.9 percent. U.S. Treasury debt prices extended losses after a $35billion five-year note auction "tailed," with its high yieldsignificantly above the open market yield at the same time. "Today's auction was another disappointment that shouldcast a pall over Treasuries for some sessions to come," saidWilliam O'Donnell, head of Treasury strategy at RBS Securitiesin Stamford, Connecticut, in a note to clients after theauction. The hopes for a resolution to Greece's problems also cutany safety bid for Treasuries. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  wasdown 31/32 in price to yield 3.04 percent. The Bund future  hit a session low of 126.16 andlast traded down 69 ticks on the day at 126.21. The package to be voted on by Greek lawmakers includesspending cuts, tax increases and privatizations required byinternational lenders as a price for further financial aid. Euro zone banks and insurers are considering a planoutlined by French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Monday underwhich private bondholders would reinvest half of the proceedsof maturing Greek debt in new 30-year bonds paying 5.5 percentinterest plus a bonus linked to Greece's GDP growth rate. Rudy Narvas, senior economist at Societe Generale in NewYork, said investors should get used to jitters over debtproblems in Greece and other European countries like Portugalas they are not going anywhere, at least for a while. "Right now we have got a Band-Aid with the current packageand also the French plan, which is on the table for banks," hesaid, "but in the end what it really comes down to is, this isa patch, and we have to look forward to the same thingoccurring possibly in three months."
