<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was broadly lower against the other major currencies on Thursday, as unconfirmed media reports that Spanish government officials were in talks with the euro zone over an aid package supported the euro, while U.S. data earlier in the day tempered expectations for more easing by the Federal Reserve.During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was trading close to a seven-week low against the euro, with EUR/USD up 0.40% to 1.2578.In the U.S., official data showed that new home sales in the U.S. rose more-than-expected in July, climbing 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted 372,000 units in July, beating expectations for a 2.6% increase to 365,000. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of people filing for initial jobless benefits rose by 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 372,000 last week, compared to expectations for a decline of 3,000 to 365,000.The previous week’s figure was revised up to 368,000 from a previously reported 366,000.Wednesday’s minutes of the Fed’s August meeting showed that many policymakers think additional easing may be warranted "fairly soon" unless there is evidence of a "substantial and sustainable" strengthening in the economic recovery.Concerns over prospects for a third round of stimulus from the U.S. central bank overshadowed weak economic data out of the euro zone and China earlier in the day.A report earlier showed that manufacturing activity in the euro zone rose more-than-expected in August, but remained in contraction territory for the 12th consecutive month, while service sector activity slumped to a two-month low.A separate report showed that manufacturing activity in China slumped to a nine-month low in August, adding to concerns over a slowdown in the world’s second largest economy.The greenback was little changed against the pound, with GBP/USD dipping 0.01% to 1.5871.Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY slipping 0.14% to 78.47 and USD/CHF down 0.41% to 0.9546.Switzerland posted a larger-than-expected trade surplus of CHF2.91 billion in July official data showed earlier, beating expectations for a surplus of CHF1.44 billion.The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD inching up 0.08% to 0.9921, AUD/USD down 0.28% to 1.0475 and NZD/USD rising 0.22% to trade at 0.8158.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.34% to 81.30             ]]></raw>
