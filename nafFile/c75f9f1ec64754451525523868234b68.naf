<raw><![CDATA[ * New Central Bank Gold Agreement cuts sales quota to 400 T * German, French, Italian cenbanks eyed for sales * ECB may be seller if euro gold prices rise  By Jan Harvey LONDON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Gold sales under the new CentralBank Gold Agreement are unlikely to reach their full quota of2,000 tonnes over the next five years, or 400 tonnes per year,the chairman of metals consultancy GFMS told Reuters on Friday. The latest version of the CBGA, announced earlier on Friday,cuts the amount of gold the nineteen signatories of theagreement can sell each year by 100 tonnes, after sales underthe existing pact fell well short of its 500 tonne quota. A new agreement will cover sales of 403 tonnes of goldalready announced by the International Monetary Fund, though thefund itself is not a signatory. But GFMS' Philip Klapwijk saidsales under the pact were still likely to be less than allowed. "I would be very surprised if there were 2,000 tonnes ofgold to sell, or a willingness at this stage to sell that much,"he said. "Excluding the IMF from the analysis.... I'm notconvinced there are 1,600 tonnes of sales ready to go." Nonetheless, the continued existence of the CBGA --originally signed in 1999 to bring stability to the gold market-- is likely to lend some support to prices, he said. "The fact they've reduced the limit to 400 tonnes from 500is positive (for the gold market), and the fact that they'vesaid sales will continue to be through some sort of controlledmechanism will give the market a degree of certainty," he said. The main gold holders covered by the CBGA are Germany --which according to the World Gold Council has the world's secondlargest gold reserves after the United States at 3,412.6 tonnes-- Italy, France and Switzerland. PLANNED SALESThe Bundesbank had no comment on its sales plans on Friday,pointing to its past practice of deciding every autumn on itsgold holdings for the following 12 months.The Swiss National Bank said on Friday it has no plans tosell any gold holdings in the foreseeable future. Klapwijk said the most obvious sources for further goldsales were smaller members of the CBGA and the European CentralBank itself. The ECB has had a tendency to keep its goldreserves close to 15 percent, he said. "I can imagine, if euro gold prices go higher and the ECBsees that gold gets to a certain percentage of reserves, theywill be a natural seller for that reason," he said. Euro-denominated gold has nearly doubled in value since thelast agreement was signed in September 2004 to around 670 eurosan ounce. The price of spot gold has climbed to some $960 anounce from around $410 an ounce in the same period. Klapwijk said the omission in the latest version of the CBGAof references to gold leasing and the use of gold futures andoptions also "opens up some interesting possibilities." "There is a reasonably convincing case for central bankswith large gold holdings which under certain circumstances theymight be prepared to sell to try and generate some sort ofincome on those holdings through the use of derivativeinstruments," he said. "This has opened up the possibility for European centralbanks to start using these derivative instruments."
