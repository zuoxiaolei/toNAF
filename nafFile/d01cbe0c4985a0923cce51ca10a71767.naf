<raw><![CDATA[   * C$ ends at 97.38 U.S. cents * Bonds largely flat across curve * Canadian retail sales up 0.5 pct in August * Domestic inflation muted (Updates to close, adds quote) By Jennifer Kwan TORONTO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar was flatversus the U.S. currency on Friday as investors failed to makeany major bets either way amid uncertainty about the outcome ofa meeting of the G20 leading economies this weekend. The currency mimicked moves in other markets, includingworld stocks, which wavered on Friday as traders took profitsafter this week's run-up. [MKTS/GLOB] The U.S. dollar ticked higher against major currencies onuncertainty ahead of the gathering of finance ministers andcentral bank chiefs in South Korea. [FRX/] The G20 is striving to put the world economy on a morestable footing and defuse currency tensions that economistsfear could trigger trade wars. [ID:nTOE69L00U] "You've got the sense that the U.S. is basically out theresaying we're not going to do anything to devalue the dollar.Those sort of issues have been providing some support for theU.S. dollar," said David Watt, senior currency strategist atRBC Capital Markets. "The bulk of the work for the G20 and the G20 communique isnot going to be finalized until the weekend so the markets areprepared for, well, just in case there's an agreement, we don'tnecessarily want to be caught short the dollar." But Watt added the market was cautious in general aboutwhat's going to happen with currencies, given speculation theFederal Reserve will announce more monetary easing next month,likely through direct purchases of U.S. Treasury debt. The Canadian dollar  ended at C$1.0269 to the U.S.dollar, or 97.38 U.S. cents, down a hair from Thursday's closeat C$1.0263 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.44 U.S. cents. It wasdown 1.5 percent for the week. Earlier, the currency firmed to a session high of C$1.0224to the U.S. dollar, or 97.81 U.S. cents, supported in part bydata showing Canadian retail sales in August beat expectations. [ID:nN22252766] [ID:nN22149720] "Retail sales were above expectations," said CamillaSutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital. "There was a revision higher as well to the July numbers.It's a bit stale coming from the summer, but still it's apositive print for Canada as our data has been a bit unevenlately, so this is a positive piece in terms of updating us onwhere the consumer sits." Economists said Friday's September inflation data, whichwas largely muted, was unlikely to strengthen the resolve ofthose who think the Bank of Canada will begin to raise interestrates soon. The central bank paused on rate increases earlier thisweek, and said that it would have to consider any further ratehikes carefully, given the patchy global recovery.[ID:nN20223890] BONDS LITTLE CHANGED Canadian bond prices were mostly flat as the marketremained largely subdued ahead of November's Federal OpenMarket Committee meeting, where the U.S. central bank couldannounce further monetary stimulus. [US/] Reaction to the Canadian economic data and corporateissuance throughout the day caused some gyrations across thecurve, but the prevailing theme remains the expectation the Fedwill engage in quantitative easing, said Ian Pollick, portfoliostrategist at TD Securities. "We did take some price action from the U.S., we wereoverperforming, at the beginning part of the day. The datadidn't do too much to the curve," he said. "You really have a prevailing bias in the market and that'sabout quantitative easing." The two-year bond  was down 2 Canadian cents toyield 1.401 percent, while the 30-year bond  was up15 Canadian cents to yield 3.439 percent. In new issuances, Royal Bank of Canada   sold C$1.5billion of medium-term notes on Friday, according to a termsheet seen by Reuters.
