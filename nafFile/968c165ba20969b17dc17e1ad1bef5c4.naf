<raw><![CDATA[ * Countries examine how safeguard will work in practice * Banana deal waiting on other tropical products * Deal might come next week, or after Nov.30 - Dec.2 meet  By Jonathan Lynn GENEVA, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Negotiations on agriculture inthe World Trade Organisation's long-running Doha round aremaking progress in a number of sensitive areas, the chairman ofthe farm talks said on Friday. WTO members are looking in detail at how a safeguard toprotect farmers in poor countries from a surge in imports -- theissue over which talks in July 2008 seeking a breakthrough inDoha collapsed -- might work in practice, New Zealand's WTOambassador David Walker told reporters. And talks on reconciling the conflicting demands ofdifferent groups of developing country exporters of tropicalproducts such as fruit and sugar are also going well, Walker,who chairs the farm talks, said after a meeting of WTO members. These topics are among the most complicated that need to besolved for the WTO's 153 members to reach an outline deal, knownin trade jargon as "modalities", in the 8-year-old Doha talks. "On the modalities issues we had some good engagement,"Walker said.  SAVING THE SAFEGUARD WTO members are also making progress in preparing thedocumentation for the lengthy and complicated process ofconverting the formulas in modalities into specific cuts intariffs and subsidies, Walker said. The safeguard would allow poor countries to temporarilyraise tariffs if their farmers were confronted with a suddendestabilising flood of imports. But the questions of how far tariffs could rise, for howlong and in what circumstances torpedoed the July 2008 attemptat a breakthrough, with India saying it would not sacrifice thelivelihoods of its subsistence farmers for a deal. India's WTO ambassador, Ujal Singh Bhatia, told Friday'smeeting that it was productive for WTO members to examinespecific scenarios of how the safeguard would work rather thanexchanging statements of principle, according to a participant. But he reminded members that such a special safeguardmechanism would have to be simple and straightforward for poorcountries to be able to use it when necessary. While India and the United States were the most publicadversaries over the safeguard, the question also pitteddifferent groups of developing countries against each other,just as with tropical products. One set of proposals in the Doha talks, launched in November2001 to open markets and help developing countries prosperthrough more trade, would see tariffs come down faster and moresteeply for tropical products than in general, benefitingcountries in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Another proposal would do the opposite -- phase in cuts onthese goods more slowly and gently -- so that former Europeancolonies in Africa and the Caribbean with preferential access tothe European market can keep their advantage for longer. Reconciling this means negotiating which products will getwhich treatment.  The most sensitive one is bananas, where Latin Americanproducers are demanding the European Union cuts tariffs whichdiscriminate against their fruit in favour of the African andCaribbean growers. A deal on bananas -- the subject of the longest-runningtrade dispute -- is imminent, but is awaiting agreement on othertropical products such as rum and tobacco, Latin Americandiplomats said. "If we had a deal on tropical products today, bananas wouldfall tomorrow," said one diplomat. A tropical products deal including bananas could come nextweek. If not, the countries involved have decided to postponefurther negotiations until after the WTO's three-day ministerialconference starting Nov. 30, the diplomats said.
