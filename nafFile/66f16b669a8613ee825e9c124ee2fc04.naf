<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The U.S. dollar was down against almost all of its major counterparts on Wednesday, as a cautious sense of optimism that euro zone policymakers would reach an agreement on a second bailout for Greece on Thursday supported risk sentiment.During U.S. morning trade, the greenback was lower against the euro, with EUR/USD climbing 0.27% to hit 1.4194.Earlier in the day, the head of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso warned that European Union leaders must reach a resolution to Greece’s debt crisis at Thursday’s emergency summit, or the global economy will pay the price.The greenback also dipped against the pound, with GBP/USD inching up 0.07% to hit 1.6135.The minutes of the Bank of England’s monetary policy meeting released earlier showed that policymakers voted 7-2 to keep rates unchanged at 0.5% in July.In addition, the greenback was down against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY shedding 0.38% to hit 78.86 and USD/CHF falling 0.46% to hit 0.8200.Earlier in the day, Japan’s finance minister reiterated that his government was ready to take decisive steps on currencies in order to stem excessive or volatile yen moves.Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against its Canadian and Australian counterparts, but eased higher against its New Zealand cousin, with USD/CAD sliding 0.31% to hit 0.9468, AUD/USD inching up 0.08% to hit 1.0743 and NZD/USD slipping 0.13% to hit 0.8543.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.43%.Earlier Wednesday, U.S. industry data showed that sales of previously owned homes tumbled unexpectedly to a seven-month low in June.The National Association of Realtors said that existing home sales declined by 0.8% to a seasonally adjusted 4.77 million units, from 4.81 million units in May, as contract cancellations spiked.             ]]></raw>
