<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro gains 0.3 percent vs dollar, lifted by ZEW data  * German ZEW indicator rises more than forecast to 56.1 * Riskier FX gain vs dollar, yen as stocks, oil rise  (Updates prices, adds quotes) By Jessica Mortimer LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The euro gained against thedollar and the yen on Tuesday, recovering from losses theprevious session as a better-than-expected German investorsentiment survey buoyed optimism about economic recovery. Germany's ZEW economic research institute's economicsentiment index rose to 56.1 in August from 39.5 in July, takingthe indicator to its highest level since April 2006 and beatingforecasts for 45.0.. "We expect (German) growth rates to be strong in the secondhalf of the year. This assumption is supported by theimprovement in the ZEW indicator," said Ralph Solveen, economistat Commerzbank. Data last week showed Germany exited recession in the secondquarter, with gross domestic product unexpectedly rising. At 1025 GMT, the euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.4123, havinghit a session high $1.4155 on EBS trading systems after the ZEWdata. On Monday it fell as low as $1.4045. Against the yen, the euro rose 1 percent to 134.26 yen,having hit a session high of 134.81 yen on EBS, well aboveMonday's low of 132.51 yen. A 1 percent rise in European shares, accompanied by a 0.7percent gain in U.S. S&P 500 stock futures and a recovery in oilprices also helped lift investor sentiment. This lent support to the euro and perceived higher riskcurrencies such as the Australian dollar, which recovered fromsharp falls against the U.S. dollar and the yen on Monday, whilestronger-than-forecast inflation data lifted sterling. Analysts noted, however, that investors were yet to beconvinced that the recent downward move in equities is over. "From a sentiment point of view, it was good to see the ZEWbounce, but the market is waiting to see whether the positivetone in equities can last into the U.S. session," said MichaelKlawitter, senior currency strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort inFrankfurt. The dollar rose 0.6 percent to 95.07 yen, while the dollarindex dipped 0.2 percent to 79.144. The higher risk Australiandollar gained 0.5 percent to $0.8248. STERLING SHINES Headline annual UK CPI inflation unexpectedly held steady inJuly at 1.8 percent.. Analysts had predicted a further easing below the Bank ofEngland's 2 percent target to 1.5 percent and the news liftedsterling, which gained 0.6 percent against the dollar to $1.6449. Sterling has come under broad selling pressure since the BoEopted to expand asset purchases under its quantitative easingprogramme to a bigger-than-expected 175 billion pounds earlierthis month, saying Britain's downturn looked deeper thanpreviously thought.
