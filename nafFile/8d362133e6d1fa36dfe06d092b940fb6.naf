<raw><![CDATA[ * Farm subsidies, overseas business programs could suffer * Tea Party sees some programs as "corporate welfare"  * (Adds chamber support for Tea Party candidates) By Richard Cowan and Thomas Ferraro WASHINGTON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Tea Party-backed candidateswho have already taken aim at Democrats and big governmentspending, could also declare war on federal programs importantto American business, Bruce Josten, chief lobbyist for the U.S.Chamber of Commerce, warned on Tuesday. Josten said many of the Tea Party-backed candidates, whoare self-styled anti-establishment "populists," might work tokill off federal programs they see as nothing more than"corporate welfare," even though the business community toutstheir job-creating benefits. Another Chamber of Commerce official noted it supportedRepublican Senate candidates such as Rand Paul in Kentucky andMarco Rubio in Florida, who "have been commonly referred to as'Tea Party candidates.'" The conservative Tea Party movement has grown in strengththrough the year, knocking off a handful of establishmentRepublican candidates in party primaries, by pushing an agendafocused on reducing spending, cutting taxes and limitinggovernment. Josten noted that Tea Party-backed candidates who winelection to Congress in November may push to kill, for example,the U.S-run Export-Import Bank and the Overseas PrivateInvestment Corporation, both of which help assist in financingthe export of U.S. goods and services and aid Americanbusinesses investing overseas. "There's going to be a certain amount of populistcandidates that get elected that probably are not going toshare some of the views of some of the business organizationsin town," Josten told the Reuters Washington Summit. While the Chamber of Commerce supports dismantling somefederal crop supports, such as for cotton and sugar producers,Tea Party members of Congress "may want to go even further" bykilling a "host of (farm) subsidies," said Josten, whose isexecutive vice president of the Chamber of Commerce. U.S. taxpayers will spend about $7 billion next yearhelping corn, wheat, soybean and other farmers. Republican Senator John McCain told the Reuters WashingtonSummit on Monday that the rise of the Tea Party would putpressure on big government spending on lawmakers' pet projects. "I think if there's anything about the Tea Party movement-- there are many things the Tea Party movement is about, butone of them is, they are tired of this earmarking, porkbarreling corruption. So I think we need to address that issuestraight on," McCain said. Many of the programs Republicans, including McCain and TeaParty activists, have talked about cutting would achieve onlyminor savings in a huge federal budget. Business groups have complained that President Barack Obamaand his fellow Democrats in Congress have imposed onerous newrules, from a massive financial industry reform law to historichealthcare reforms. 'PRETTY SOLID HANDFUL OF VOTES' But a Republican win in Nov. 2 congressional elections withthe help of the Tea Party,  could cause new problems for thebusiness community. Amid record U.S. budget deficits and a public backlashagainst federal spending, federal subsidies for corporationscould also be the target of a Tea Party attack. Some oilcompany tax breaks already have been targeted by Democrats. Josten predicted that about half of the new Republicans whowill win seats in the House of Representatives in Novemberwould have Tea Party ties. A couple also could land seats in the Senate, where theycould collaborate with some Republican conservatives to form a"pretty solid handful of votes," Josten said. He sees the Tea Party extending its influence in variousways, even though political observers do not expect Republicansto pick up a veto-proof majority in Congress. Although major initiatives, such as repealing healthcarereform, will be beyond reach without a veto-proof majority,Josten said a newly powerful conservative contingent could takea "rifle-shot" approach by trying to pick off the mostobjectionable parts of healthcare reform, or by cutting back onsome Medicare health programs for the elderly. Josten said it was unclear what the House would or evencould do if Republicans win control with a contingent of TeaParty-backed candidates. "You hear some views that some members of the Tea Party,like the progressives on left, don't want their members to becompromising at all," Josten said. "I don't think we know the answers to how the 111thCongress is going to kind of oil the wheels to move forward." (Editing by Leslie Adler and Peter Cooney)             ]]></raw>
