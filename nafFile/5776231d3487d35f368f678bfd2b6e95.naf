<raw><![CDATA[   * Euro hits 14-mth high vs dollar in quiet trade * Sterling rises after Friday's losses, but outlook grim * China should increase EUR, JPY holdings - Chinese report * BoC's Carney repeats concern on Canada dollar strength  (Recasts, updates prices, adds comment, BoC statement,changes byline, dateline, previous LONDON) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The dollar weakened on Mondayin generally quiet trading, hitting a 14-month low against theeuro, as gains in stocks and growing evidence of a globalrecovery reduced safe-haven demand for the U.S. currency. A Chinese report saying Beijing should increase itsholdings of euros and yen in its foreign reserves also promptedinvestors to sell the dollar, but the selling has since taperedoff. "This is all a continuation of the last week's dollarselling. There has really been no news to drive today'smarkets, but we're continuing to see gains in equitiespressuring the dollar," said Camilla Sutton, senior currencystrategist, at Scotia Capital in Toronto. Meanwhile, the story out of China was an opinion piece inthe Financial News, a paper published by the People's Bank ofChina, which said the dollar should remain the principalcurrency in China's foreign exchange reserves but that theshare of euros and yen should increase. [ID:nPEK285229] Scotia's Sutton said the Chinese report was nothing new andthe impact was pretty much short-lived. "The official who madecomment was not even senior and everyone knows it takes time todiversify out of the U.S. dollar because there really is noalternative." In early New York trading, the euro was up 0.1 percent at$1.5016 , having earlier risen as high as $1.5064 ontrading platform EBS, its highest since August 2008. The ICE Futures dollar index , a gauge of thegreenback's performance against six other major currencies, wasdown 0.1 percent at 75.401, moving back towards a 14-month lowof 74.940 touched last week. But analysts expressed concern there may be limited scopefor further dollar selling, given that investors are alreadyvery short of dollars. Data on Friday showed currency speculators increased betsagainst the U.S. dollar, with the value of the dollar's netshort position rising to $18.65 billion in the week ending Oct20 from a $17.99 billion net short the prior week.[ID:nN23573397] "The issue of reserve diversification has been an ongoingtopic for quite a while, while the other reason the dollar isnot selling off more sharply is that the market is already veryshort dollars and there is only a certain extent that peoplewant to be short," said Michael Klawitter, senior currencystrategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.1 percent to 91.95 yen, retreating from a one-month high of 92.23 yen hit onEBS earlier in the day. Sterling  edged up 0.2 percent to $1.6341, not farfrom an earlier one-week low of $1.6251. Investors remainedbearish on sterling after data on Friday showed the UK economyunexpectedly contracted in the third quarter. In Canada, central bank governor Mark Carney repeatedconcerns about the adverse impact of a strong currency on itseconomy. See [ID:nBAC002343]. The U.S. dollar was 0.4 percenthigher versus the Canadian dollar to C$1.0571 . The New Zealand dollar, meanwhile, underperformed, down 0.1percent on the day at US$0.7532  after the country'sPrime Minister John Key said New Zealand is concerned over thestrength of its currency, but has few tools at its disposal todeal with it. [ID:nKLA010454] Monday is a quiet day for economic data and focus is likelyto center on events later in the week, including U.S. grossdomestic product data for the third quarter and interest ratedecisions in Norway and New Zealand. Figures earlier on Monday unexpectedly revealed Germanconsumer sentiment declined for the first time in just over ayear going into November.
