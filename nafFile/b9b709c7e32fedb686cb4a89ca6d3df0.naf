<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar was broadly higher against the other major currencies on Tuesday as the dollar’s gains against sterling led the greenback higher across the board.During European afternoon trade, the dollar rose to seven week highs against the pound, with GBP/USD dropping 0.76% to 1.5139 after official data showed that U.K. consumer inflation slowed to an annual rate of 2.4% in April from 2.8% the previous month. It was the first fall since September and was below expectations for a reading of 2.6%.The slowdown in inflation will give incoming Bank of England Governor Mark Carney more leeway to implement policy measures to bolster the U.K. economic recovery.The dollar recovered almost all of the previous session’s losses against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.50% to 102.77.Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned ahead of Wednesday’s Federal Reserve minutes and testimony at the U.S. Joint Economic Committee by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.Markets were awaiting any indication that the U.S. central bank will begin to scale back its asset purchase program this year after recent U.S. economic data bolstered optimism over the economic recovery.Elsewhere, the euro was lower against the dollar, with EUR/USD sliding 0.12% to 1.2867.Germany’s Bundesbank said Tuesday that it expects economic growth to be stronger in the second quarter of this year, but said that the weak economic situation in the euro zone remains a “significant” risk to the economy.Data last week showed that the Germany economy expanded by 0.1% in the three months to March, while the euro zone economy contracted by 0.2%.The dollar was higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF climbing 0.24% to 0.9691.The greenback was broadly stronger against its Australian, New Zealand and Canadian counterparts, with AUD/USD down 0.24% to 0.9781, NZD/USD down 0.30% to 0.8146 and USD/CAD rising 0.33% to 1.0275.Earlier Tuesday, the minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s May meeting said low inflation, sluggish economic growth and a high Australian dollar gave the bank leeway to cut interest rates this month.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.28% to 84.15.              ]]></raw>
