<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – Last Friday saw the U.S. dollar pare losses against the yen, pulling back from a four-month low after the initial euphoria generated by an agreement on a second bailout for Greece faded, boosting the greenback.USD/JPY hit 78.21 on Friday, the pair’s lowest since March 17; the pair subsequently consolidated at 78.52 by close of trade, still down 0.70% on the week.The pair is likely to find support at 77.09, the low of March 17 and resistance at 79.31, the high of July 20.On Thursday, euro zone leaders announced a new aid package for Greece worth EUR159 billion, with bondholders agreeing to contribute to the bailout. They also expanded the role of the European Financial Stability Facility to purchase bonds from indebted nations, assist troubled banks and offer credit lines.But the greenback strengthened broadly on Friday as investors questioned whether the new aid deal for Greece was enough to stop the debt crisis from spreading to Italy and Spain.On Wednesday, Japan’s Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said the yen’s gains were a reflection of concerns over sovereign debt in Europe and the U.S. more than a reflection of Japan's economic fundamentals. He added that the government was ready to take decisive steps on currencies if needed to stem excessive or volatile moves.Meanwhile, talks between U.S. President Barack Obama and Republicans aimed at raising the U.S. debt ceiling in order to avert a default broke down late Friday, amid disagreement over the role of taxes in any deficit reduction plan.The U.S. will run out of funds to service its debt on August 2 if Congress does not approve additional borrowing. Ratings agency Standard & Poor's said Thursday that there is a 50-50 chance that the triple-A credit rating of the U.S. could be cut within three months.In the week ahead, as concerns over the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone recede, investors will be focusing on U.S. efforts to agree on a USD3 trillion deficit-reduction plan. Markets will also be looking towards Friday’s data on U.S. second quarter gross domestic product, in order to gauge the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.
