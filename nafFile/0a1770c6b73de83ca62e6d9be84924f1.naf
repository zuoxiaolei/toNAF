<raw><![CDATA[   * Dollar dips vs basket, remains in tight ranges * U.S. retail sales beat expectations * Sterling underperforms on expectations of more BoE QE (Recasts, adds comment, updates prices, changes byline) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged loweragainst a basket of currencies on Tuesday as gains in globalstock markets reduced the greenback's appeal as a safe haven. Investors' appetite for risk improved after Wall Streetrose on a government report showing sales at U.S. retailers hittheir fastest pace in 3-1/2 years in August. European sharesended higher, led by banks. But major currency pairs were confined in narrow ranges asinvestors paused after pushing the U.S. dollar to a 2009 lowversus the euro and a near one-year low against a basket thismonth. "The U.S. dollar is oversold and the market is using theopportunity just to realign the positioning of thesignificantly oversold levels," said Matthew Strauss, seniorcurrency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto."Overall, the market is still looking for direction." In early afternoon trading in New York, the ICE FuturesU.S. dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against abasket of other major currencies, fell 0.25 percent to 76.504.The index hit a near one-year low of 76.457 last week. The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.4635 while the dollar waslittle changed at 90.98 yen. Earlier in the session, the dollar had risen after strongretail sales data bolstered hopes the United States will be atthe forefront of a global economic recovery and that theFederal Reserve would raise interest rates sooner rather thanlater. "There is no question of this being positive data, eventhough the cash-for-clunkers program was a huge part of it,"said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at the Bankof New York Mellon in New York. "It's consistent with the storythat the economy has bottomed though not yet in a position forfiscal and monetary stimulus to be removed." Sterling dropped after Bank of England Governor Mervyn Kingsaid the central bank was looking at reducing the rate oncommercial banks' reserves, fueling speculation of furtherquantitative easing. Sterling was last down 0.6 percent against the dollar at$1.6467 and off 0.7 percent versus the euro at 88.86 pence.
