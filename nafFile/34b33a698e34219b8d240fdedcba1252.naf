<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The New Zealand dollar edged lower against its U.S. counterpart on Friday, as mounting concerns that Greece’s sovereign debt crisis could worsen and spill over to the region’s banking sector prompted investors to shun riskier assets.NZD/USD hit 0.8080 on Thursday, the pair’s lowest since June 20; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.8125 by close of trade on Friday, shedding 0.3% over the week.The pair was likely to find support at 0.8080, Thursday’s low and resistance at 0.8193, Wednesday’s high. Greece’s parliament must approve a EUR28.4 billion austerity package next week in order to receive a second tranche of bailout loans from the European Union and International Monetary Fund and avert a sovereign debt default.On Friday, Socialist deputy Thomas Robopoulos said he wasn't prepared to vote for the government's planned austerity package, echoing comments made by opposition leader Antonis Samaras a day earlier. A brief suspension in trading of Italian bank shares on Friday added to concerns that the region’s debt crisis could spill over to other peripheral euro zone member states, spurring a flight to safety. The greenback was also boosted after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke confirmed Wednesday that the bank was winding up its monetary easing program at the end of this month and said further easing was unlikely.Meanwhile, the kiwi found support after New Zealand’s government on Thursday offered to buy approximately 5,000 earthquake-damaged homes in Christchurch as part of a recovery package.Prime Minister John Key said that nearly 10,000 homes still needed to be assessed, fuelling expectations that rebuilding of the quake-hit areas will stimulate the economy.  In the week ahead, the focus looks likely to remain on Greece, with the Greek parliament due to hold its critical vote on austerity measures on Wednesday and Thursday. Meanwhile, a relatively small amount of U.S. data is scheduled for release, with the main highlight looking likely to be Friday’s ISM manufacturing index.Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.Monday, June 27New Zealand is to publish official data on its trade balance, the difference in value between imported and exported goods and services over the month.Meanwhile, the U.S. is to publish government data on personal income and expenditure as well as a consumer price index.Tuesday, June 28The U.S. is to publish industry data on house price inflation, a leading indicator of the housing industry's health as well as a report on consumer confidence, a leading indicator of consumer spending.Wednesday, June 29The U.S. is to publish industry data on pending home sales as well as official data on crude oil stockpiles.Thursday, June 30New Zealand is to publish official data on building consents, a leading gauge of future construction activity, as well as a report on business confidence, an important indicator of economic health.Later in the day, the U.S. is to publish its weekly government report on initial jobless claims, as well as data on manufacturing activity in the Chicago region.Friday, July 1The U.S. is to round up the week with a report by the Institute of Supply Management on manufacturing activity and revised data on consumer sentiment and inflation expectations from the University of Michigan.             ]]></raw>
