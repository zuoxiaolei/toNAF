<raw><![CDATA[ * Gonzalez-Paramo says ECB bond buying not comparable to QE * Says ECB in charge of monetary policy, not fiscal policy   (Adds quotes, details) By Martin Roberts SARRIA, Spain, Nov 12 (Reuters) - A senior European CentralBank member suggested on Friday the bank had no plans to step upits purchases of euro zone bonds, saying its debt buying was notcomparable to those of the U.S. and British central banks. The ECB has spent a total of 64 billion euros buying bondssince May, but the pace of purchases has dropped off and thebank has been reluctant to buy the debt of crisis-hit euro zonecountries like Ireland and Portugal. "This programme is not comparable to American or Britishquantitative easing," European Central Bank Executive BoardMember Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said when asked why the bankwas not buying more peripheral euro zone debt. "We are in charge of monetary not fiscal policy," he toldreproters before giving a speech in northern Spain. Last week the U.S. central bank announced a new programme ofquantitative easing, in which it intends to buy $600 billion ofU.S. government securities through the middle of next year in aneffort to bolster the economy. Gonzalez-Paramo welcomed a statement from France, Germany,Italy, Spain and Britain at the G20 summit in Seoul thatconfirmed debt holders would not take a hit if the EU proceededwith plans to introduce a new mechanism allowing crisis-hitcountries to restructure their debt. He said it was up to each member of the European Union todecide whether it needed financial aid from the EU's current aidfacility, declining to comment on whether Ireland was seekingfinancial assistance. During his speech, Gonzalez-Paramo said the euro currencyzone was not in crisis but lacked a framework for its members tocoordinate fiscal and macroeconomic policies He predicted that the gap in economic growth rates betweendifferent countries in the euro zone would close next year.While Germany's economy is expected to expand by more than 3percent this year, growth in Spain has stagnated.
