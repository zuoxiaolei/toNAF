<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar pared gains against the yen on Wednesday, pulling back from two-and-a-half year highs after preliminary data showed that the U.S. economy contracted unexpectedly in the three months to December.During European afternoon trade, the dollar pulled back from two-and-a-half year highs against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.52% to 91.16, down from a session high of 91.41.The Commerce Department said the economy contracted by 0.1% in the fourth quarter, defying expectations for growth of 1.1% and a sharp slowdown from growth of 3.1% in the preceding quarter.A separate report showed that the U.S. private sector added 192,000 jobs in January, above expectations for an increase of 165,000.

The U.S. central bank was expected to reaffirm its commitment to its easing program until the unemployment rate falls below 6.5%.In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe rejected criticism that Japan’s fiscal and monetary stimulus program was aimed at weakening the yen on Wednesday, saying the measures were aimed at combating deflation.The greenback was at 14-month lows against the euro, with EUR/USD advancing 0.46% to 1.3553 as sentiment on the single currency continued to be underpinned by indications that the worst of the crisis in the euro zone is over.The euro shrugged off data showing that Spain’s economy contracted by 0.7% in the three months to December, bringing the annualized rate of contraction to a larger-than-forecast 1.8%.The greenback hit session lows against the pound, with USD/GBP up 0.22% to 1.5796.
