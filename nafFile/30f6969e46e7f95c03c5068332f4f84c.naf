<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro extended Thursday's losses into Friday after positive U.S. economic data continued to send investors snapping up dollar positions on sentiments the Federal Reserve is growing closer to unwinding stimulus programs.Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said earlier this week that monetary stimulus programs, which weaken the dollar to spur recovery, may scale back this year if the economy improves.In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was down 0.73% at 1.3123, up from a session low of 1.3116 and off from a high of 1.3254.The pair was likely to find support at 1.2956, the low from June 3, and resistance at 1.3416, Wednesday's high.The dollar continued to advance after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said Thursday that its manufacturing index rose to 12.5 in June from -5.2 in May, well above expectations for a -2.0 reading.A separate report showed Thursday that U.S. existing home sales climbed 4.2% to 5.18 million units in May from Aprilâ€™s total of 4.97 million, far surpassing market calls for a 0.6% increase.Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said earlier this week that monetary authorities could begin scaling back the U.S. central bank's USD85 billion-a-month asset purchasing program later this year and close it down completely by the middle of 2014 if the economy gains steam.Meanwhile in the eurozone, the European Central Bank said the bloc's current account surplus narrowed to EUR19.5 billion in April from a EUR25.9 billion surplus in March, confounding expectations for the surplus to narrow to EUR14.2 billion.The euro, meanwhile, was up against the pound and down against the yen, with EUR/GBP trading up 0.12% at 0.8534, and EUR/JPY trading down 0.49% at 127.92.In the U.K. earlier, official data revealed that public-sector net borrowing rose less than expected in May, rising by GBP10.5 billion, after a GBP6.6 billion increase the previous month.
