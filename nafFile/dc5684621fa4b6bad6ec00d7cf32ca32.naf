<raw><![CDATA[ * Allocation shifts slightly to stocks from bonds * Some see worries over European debt as overblown * Fund managers raise euro zone stock weighting, cut U.S. By Akiko Takeda TOKYO, May 27 (Reuters) - Japanese fund managers slightlyraised their weighting for stocks in May from the previousmonth's seven-year low on the view that recent market pessimismover Europe's debt woes is overblown. But some fund managers are nervous about market volatilityand fret that further fallout from the European debt crisis couldinfect the global economy. "Market players have recently sold the euro on almost anyexcuse, including Germany's ban on naked short-selling. To me,these reactions smack of typical overshooting," said YoshinoriNagano, senior strategist at Daiwa Asset Management.  The average share weighting edged up to 45.0 percent in Mayfrom 44.8 percent in April, which was a seven-year low.  The average bond weighting dropped to 48.4 percent from a10-month high of 49.1 percent in April, according to the poll of11 fund managers taken from May 13-21. The weighting for cashrose slightly to 3.3 percent from 3.1 percent. During the survey period, global share prices plunged onconcerns that Europe's deepening debt crisis might derail aglobal economic recovery. The U.S. Standard and Poor's Index has fallen nearly 10percent so far this month, while Japan's Nikkei share average hasdropped more than 13 percent. The massive fall in share prices has made some fund managerscautious. "We are reducing risk assets, considering Europe's debtproblems and their impact on the global economy. We are alsoincreasing our short positions on the euro to prepare for furtherdeterioration in Europe's fiscal woes," said a fund manager whodeclined to be identified because of company policy. But others were more bullish on the global economic outlook. "At first, the EU wasn't so united in supporting bailoutschemes but their political determination is getting strong,reducing the risk of full-scale global financial crisis," saidYuichi Kodama, an economist at Meiji Yasuda Life. "Financial markets may be too pessimistic about the Europeansituation." Fund managers increased their weightings on euro zone shareswithin their equity portfolio to 12.1 percent from 10.4 percent. Meiji Yasuda's Kodama said the German economy is gainingstrength and is expected to benefit further from the recent fallin the euro. On the other hand, the weighting for U.S. and Canada droppedto a 5 1/2-year low of 42.0 percent from 43.6 percent in April,while that for UK slipped to a six-year trough of 6.4 percentfrom 6.6 percent. Within bond portfolios, the weighting for North Americanbonds dropped to match a record low of 25.9 percent hit inFebruary, compared to 26.5 percent in April. The weighting for euro zone bonds increased slightly to 32.2percent from 32.0 percent. Japanese investors mostly invest inmajor euro zone nation bonds, such as German debt, and havelimited exposure to Southern European sovereign bonds.
