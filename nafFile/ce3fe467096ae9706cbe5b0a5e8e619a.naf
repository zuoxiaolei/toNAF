<raw><![CDATA[ (adds UK officials on bonuses quotes, Canada official) By Sumeet Desai and Matt Falloon LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - G20 countries still think it istoo early to remove the huge fiscal and monetary stimulus throwninto their economies but any exit strategies should be executedin a coordinated way, UK government sources said on Wednesday. And Britain, hosting a weekend meeting of finance ministersand central bankers from the Group of 20 developed and emergingnations, will propose what officials called "workable" measuresto curtail risky pay practices in the banking sector. A senior UK official said second quarter data showed theworld economy was stabilising after the worst crisis in decades. "But everyone thinks it is certainly too early to declarevictory ... The general feeling is that support measures need tobe in place until recovery is assured," he said. A senior Canadian finance official said on Wednesday thatthe stimulus may be needed through to early 2011 and a G7 sourcetold Reuters last week that G20 policymakers would not droptheir pledge to keep policy accommodative for as long as wasneeded when they issue their final statement on Saturday. Nor was the language on withdrawing the economic stimuluslikely to change materially and countries would still remaincommitted to drawing up credible exit strategies. In Brussels, European officials said that while the worst isover for the euro zone economy, it is too early to withdrawfiscal stimuli. EU Economic and Monetary Affairs CommissionerJoaquin Almunia also noted the importance of G20 coordination.[ID:nL2567159] The UK government source said that Britain had alreadysketched out a deficit reduction programme but that it wasimportant for other countries do the same. Removal of the stimulus would also have to be coordinated sothat countries were prepared for the consequences of eachother's actions and could also avoid shocking markets.  COORDINATED EXIT For example, a separate UK government source told Reuters,countries that have bought huge stakes in their banking sectormight want to exchange information on when they were sellingtheir shares so as not to undermine investor confidence. "Just as the immediate response to the global crisisdemonstrated the need for global action, the response willcontinue to have to be global," the source said. "There will have to be a lot of cooperation and exchange ofinformation." Asked whether coordination was possible when countries wouldhave their own agendas to follow, the first source said thatindividual nations would do what was right for them but it wasimportant that people knew what everyone was doing. Prime Minister Gordon Brown said this week that thechallenge for both the London ministerial meeting and theleaders' summit in Pittsburgh was to achieve a level ofcooperation that will prove helpful next year and ensure asustainable recovery. Both Brown and finance minister Alistair Darling areconcerned that even if the global recession is bottoming out, itmay be a long slog to proper recovery because of the damage doneto the financial system and U.S. consumer appetites. "I propose we also take the opportunity to discuss how toensure high sustainable global growth in the medium term,"Darling wrote to his fellow finance ministers ahead of Fridayand Saturday's meetings. "Many countries will have to rebalance their domesticeconomies," the first government source said, moving away fromexport-led growth to greater domestic demand. But he expectedlittle significant discussion on currencies.  BONUSES British officials did not rule out following through onFrench proposals to put a cap on bonuses in the financial sectorbut in practice such measures are unlikely to get off theground. Ministers would undoubtedly discuss the issue which islikely to be the biggest headline-grabber given public angerover bankers' pay and their role in the crisis at a time whenmany politicians will soon be seeking re-election. UK government sources said Darling would propose theadoption of measures that would create incentives for banks toimplement more responsible pay regimes, including higher capitalrequirements and spreading bonuses out over several years. Clawback provisions should also be introduced and bonusesshould be largely made up of non-cash options such as sharesthat vest over time to "end short term rewards", one officialsaid. "We need to discuss taking further action on executive payand compensation," Darling wrote to his colleagues. "The speed and consistency of implementation on thisimportant issue has not been sufficient to allay publicconcerns, and we need to ensure that we are acting to avoidexcessive risk taking."
