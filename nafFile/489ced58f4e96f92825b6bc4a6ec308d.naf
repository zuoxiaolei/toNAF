<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro rises, higher-risk currencies rally * Yen suffers, JP FinMin Kan seen taking over as PM (Reledes, updates throughout; previous TOKYO) By Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - The dollar fell across the boardon Thursday as a rise in global share markets on the back ofstrong U.S. economic data helped to cool extreme risk aversion. Speculation for a strong reading of U.S. jobs data due onFriday also prompted demand for riskier currencies, pushing theAustralian and New Zealand dollars higher and supporting eventhe euro, which has been plagued by euro zone debt problems. "Equity markets are looking better today," said MarcusHettinger, global currency strategist at Credit Suisse inZurich. "At least for today, we're seeing some stabilisation inrisk appetite." Stock markets around the world have been stabilising afterdeep losses suffered last month on concerns that Greece's debtwoes may spread to other euro zone nations. European shares rose roughly 2 percent in early trade,pulling further away from a nine-month low hit last week. Investors took heart in U.S. data released on Wednesday,which showed surprisingly strong pending home sales for Apriland a jump in May auto sales. Expectations that U.S. payrolls on Friday will show that513,000 jobs were created in May were also helping to whet themarket's appetite for riskier assets. U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday said he believedthe jobs report would show strong growth. By 0744 GMT, the euro traded 0.3 percent higher on the dayat $1.2285, having climbed as high as $1.2326 at the start ofEuropean trade. The single currency has found its footing after sliding aslow as $1.2110 on Tuesday, its weakest in more than four years. A trimming of some extreme short positions in the euro hashelped to stabilise the currency, but some analysts warn itsdowntrend remains intact, and that it would remains vulnerableto any signs that more euro zone nations are struggling fromdeficit and banking problems.  YEN SUFFERS Euro/dollar implied volatility was at around 15.5 percent,retreating from a 14-month high of 19 percent hit in late May,when escalating risk aversion prompted volatile trade. But even as markets have calmed since then, overall eurosentiment remains bearish. One-month 25 delta risk reversals, a barometer forshort-term fear among speculators and hedge funds, remain wellbid for more euro downside, trading at 2.85 on Thursday. Still, gains in the euro and other currencies, including theAustralian dollar which rallied 1 percent versus its U.S.counterpart, pushed the U.S. dollar index down 0.3 percent to86.555. Despite its broad losses, the dollar edged up 0.3 percent to92.45 yen. The Japanese currency suffered against its major rivals asimproving risk demand decreased its perceived safe-haven appeal. Traders also took speculation that Japan's next primeminister would take a tougher stance in fighting the yen'sstrength as an opportunity to trim long positions in the yen,market participants said. Finance Minister Naoto Kan is tipped to succeed unpopularPrime Minister Yukio Hatoyama who said on Wednesday he wasresigning. Kan surprised markets earlier this year by saying he wantedthe yen to weaken more and that most businesses favoured adollar/yen rate around 95 yen. But since then he has mostly toedthe ministry line that stable currencies are desirable andmarkets should set foreign exchange levels.
