<raw><![CDATA[ * UK Q4 GDP growth revised up to 0.4 percent q/q from 0.3pct * Recession peak to trough fall unchanged at 6.2 percent * Sterling rises in response  (Adds quotes, details) LONDON, March 30 (Reuters) - Britain's economy emerged from an 18-month recession in the fourth quarter of last year with more momentum than previously thought, official data showed on Tuesday. The Office for National Statistics said the economy grew 0.4percent in the last three months of 2009 above analysts expectations for an unrevised reading of +0.3 percent. Separate data showed Britain's current account deficit narrowed sharply in the fourth quarter after earnings on direct investment abroad hit their highest since records began in 1964. Sterling rose on the better than expected figures but the government said there were still risks to recovery, not least because of weakness in the euro zone, Britain's biggest trading partner. "While it is welcome to see an upward revision, recent data in the EU and elsewhere has highlighted that there are still risks and uncertainties to this recovery," said a government spokesman. Year-on-year, GDP contracted by 3.1 percent, less than the 3.3 percent previously reported and down sharply from the 5.3 percent drop in the third quarter. The statistics office said the upward revision to the GDP data was due to a combination of higher services, construction and agriculture output. The peak to trough fall in output during the recession remained at 6.2 percent, the biggest since comparable records began. The figures will provide some cheer to Britain's Labour government, facing potential defeat in an election expected on May 6. However, the figures are unlikely to change expectations that the recovery will be sluggish and monetary policy will remain loose for some time to come. Much of the growth came from public spending and the inventory cycle, both of which are unlikely to be supportive formuch longer. "The risks of a double dip (recession) are fairly  modest,"said Ross Walker, an economist at RBS. "But I think  there arestill some significant headwinds." Britain's current account deficit narrowed more than expected over the quarter to 1.684 billion pounds from 5.912 billion pounds, the lowest since the first quarter of 2008.
