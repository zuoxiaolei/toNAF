<raw><![CDATA[   * C$ weakens to C$0.9631 per US$, or $1.0383 * Bond prices mostly firm * Bank of Canada hold rates at 1 percent (Updates with details, comments) By Solarina Ho TORONTO, April 12 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar retreatedfrom 3-1/2 year highs on Tuesday as a basket of factors --including concerns from the Bank of Canada over the "persistentstrength" of the currency, as well as slumping oil and equities-- pressured the commodities-linked currency. The central bank, which held interest rates steady at 1percent as expected, cautioned that the soaring Canadian dollar-- which has been near highs not seen since November 2007 --could create "even greater headwinds for the Canadianeconomy." "Equities were off, oil was off, a lot of the riskcurrencies were coming under pressure, commodities were lower;the floor got pulled out from those hoping for hikes in May,"said Darcy Browne, managing director of capital markets tradingat Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. "The Bank of Canada took some of the wind out of the sailsof the Canada bulls who were hoping for near-term interest ratehikes ... This was a perfect storm for a little back-up in theCanadian dollar today." Adding to the pressure were crude prices that fell morethan 3 percent and sharply weaker global equity markets. TheToronto Stock Exchange hit its lowest point in nearly fourweeks, as energy and mining shares were battered by a broadcommodities selloff. [ID:nL3E7FC04S] [ID:nN12257134] The currency  finished the session at C$0.9631 tothe U.S. dollar, or $1.0383, down from Monday's North Americanfinish of C$0.9565 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0455, which wasclose to a 3-1/2 year high. This was the Canadian dollar'sweakest close in a week. "To me, really, nothing has changed fundamentally in theworld. But on a one day, short-term trade, it was a healthycorrection," said Browne. The central bank reiterated comments made in its March 1policy announcement, hinting that a May 31 interest rate hikewas unlikely. But it set the stage for rate increases laterthis year by predicting inflation would hit its target sixmonths earlier than previously thought. [ID:nN12159489] Market focus now is on the Bank of Canada's monetary policyreport and news conference on Wednesday morning, with tradersset to parse any further comments on the strength of theCanadian dollar. "The market's caught between a rock and a hard place here,"said Browne. "They know the bank probably wants to hike, butthe bank just can't hike when the currency's so strong. Oddlyenough, they'll get their hike if the currency weakens." BOND PRICES MOSTLY FIRM Money market rates and bond yields fell slightly after therate announcement as investors trimmed the likelihood of a rateincrease at the Bank of Canada's next policy announcement datein May. Global factors were also in play. "I think the general risk-off trend in global markets todayis the more dominant impact," said David Tulk, chief Canadamacro strategist at TD Securities. Overnight index swaps, which trade based on expectationsfor the key central bank rate, now show just a 6.13 percentchance of a rate hike on May 31, compared with 26.61 percentbefore the statement. A September rate hike remains fully priced in by the marketwith a 25 basis point rise seen.  In a Reuters poll of economists and strategists releasedlast week, however, the median forecast was for the bank tomake the first interest rate hike of the year on July 19.[CA/POLL] The two-year bond , which is especially sensitiveto Bank of Canada policy moves, was up 14.5 Canadian cents toyield 1.863 percent, while the 10-year bond  added53 Canadian cents to yield 3.423 percent.
