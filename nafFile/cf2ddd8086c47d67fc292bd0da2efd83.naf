<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar fell against most major global currencies on Thursday after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its most recent monetary policy meeting, revealing more voting members may be growing increasingly in favor of stimulating the economy.Soft U.S. housing figures also weakened the greenback.In Asian trading on Thursday, EUR/USD was up 0.10% at 1.2542.The Federal Reserve will likely stimulate the U.S. economy with monetary easing tools if it doesn't pick up the pace of its recovery soon, the U.S. central bank revealed in the minutes of its recent monetary policy meeting."Many members judged that additional monetary accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery," the minutes read. "Several members noted the benefits of accumulating further information that could help clarify the contours of the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the need for further policy action."The comments sparked a dollar selloff on the notion that the Federal Reserve will announce plans to roll out a new round of quantitative easing soon.Quantitative easing, under which the Fed buys bonds such as Treasury holdings and mortgage-backed securities from banks, weakens the dollar with the aim of spurring recovery.The Fed has rolled out two rounds of quantitative easing since the financial crisis hit in 2008, injecting USD2.3 trillion into the economy by acquiring assets held by banks.Meanwhile, existing home sales came in weaker than expected, spurring more talk of Federal Reserve intervention.Sales of previously owned homes rose 2.3% in July to 4.47 million units, the National Association of Realtors reported earlier. Analysts were expecting the number to hit 4.52 million units, however.Housing, a primary factor that sent the U.S. economy tumbling into the worst decline since the Great Depression, continues to show signs of bumping along a bottom but refuses to display marked improvement.The greenback, meanwhile, was down against the pound, with GBP/USD trading up 0.13% at 1.5901.The dollar was down against the yen, with USD/JPY trading down 0.03% at 78.56, and down against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF trading down 0.11% at 0.9576.The dollar was down against its cousins in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with USD/CAD down 0.18% at 0.9896, AUD/USD up 0.31% at 1.0538 and NZD/USD up 0.50% at 0.8182.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.18% at 81.42.Later Thursday, the U.S. will release initial jobless claims, followed by preliminary data on manufacturing activity and official data on new home sales.Forex - Dollar falls as Fed minutes reveal likelihood of stimulusInvesting.com - The dollar fell against most major global currencies on Thursday after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its most recent monetary policy meeting, revealing voting members may be growing increasingly in favor of stimulating the economy.Soft U.S. housing figures also weakened the greenback.In Asian trading on Thursday, EUR/USD was up 0.10% at 1.2542.The Federal Reserve will likely stimulate the U.S. economy with monetary easing tools if it doesn't pick up the pace of its recovery soon, the U.S. central bank revealed in the minutes of its recent monetary policy meeting."Many members judged that additional monetary accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery," the minutes read.
