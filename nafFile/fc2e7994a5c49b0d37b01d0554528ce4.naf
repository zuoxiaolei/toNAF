Wall Street ended down more than 6 percent while Europeanstocks hit a two-year low. A favored gauge of investor anxietyspiked in a sign investors are afraid of more declines to come.The CBOE Volatility Index  surged 50 percent to 48. The selling came in heavy trading, with volume of 17.5billion shares on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex andNasdaq, second only to the day after last year's sudden "flashcrash." Investors took shelter in the asset that was downgraded --choosing U.S. government bonds for their liquidity andperceived high quality. Investors were struggling to discern the effects of theU.S. credit rating downgrade to AA-plus from AAA, which couldhit various components of the vast U.S. financial sector, frommortgage lenders to municipal issuers and insurers. "It is a panic, and almost by definition it doesn't have anissue. It wouldn't matter what it was," said James Paulsen,chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, withover $340 billion in assets under management. The downgrade -- and threats of subsequent moves by S&P orother rating agencies -- raises uncertainty about thecredibility of the United States in the global economy asinvestors worry about another recession. Central to S&P's argument was that political paralysis inWashington has reached a point where the government would beunable to deal with worsening deficits and sagging economicgrowth. This burdens a stock market already skittish after lastweek's outbreak of fear. U.S. President Barack Obama blamed the downgrade onpolitical gridlock in Washington and said he would offer morerecommendations on how to reduce federal deficits.

I think it'sabout the underlying fundamentals and issues that are embodiedin the downgrade itself," said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S.equity strategist at UBS in New York. MSCI's all-country world stock index dropped 5.1 percent to its lowest level since September 2010. Monday's rush for the exits extinguished any relief fromearlier news the European Central Bank was buying Italian andSpanish government bonds in the latest move to staunch the eurozone debt crisis. [ID:nLDE7770NM] SEARCH FOR SAFETY Several major brokerages have in recent days lowered theirexpectations for U.S. economic growth and share appreciationfor 2011 and 2012. Moody's repeated a warning it could downgrade the UnitedStates before 2013 if the fiscal or economic outlook weakenedsignificantly. It said it saw the potential for a new deal inWashington to cut the budget deficit before then.[ID:nN1E77700L] The Dow Jones industrial average  dropped 634.76points, or 5.55 percent, to 10,809.85.
