Meanwhile, market participants remained cautious amid signs of an impending U.S. military strike against Syria, following the alleged use of chemical weapons.On Wednesday, President Barack Obama said the U.S. has concluded that the Syrian government carried out a chemical weapons attack near Damascus, but added that he had not yet made a decision about whether to intervene militarily.  The Aussie was steady against the New Zealand dollar with AUD/NZD easing up 0.03%, to hit 1.1463.
