<raw><![CDATA[ By Erik Kirschbaum BERLIN, March 30 (Reuters) - German companies plan to raiseinvestment in renewable energy production capacity by 50 percentto an annual 6.2 billion euros ($8.74 billion) within the nextthree years, the country's renewable energy authorities said. A survey of 304 companies involved in producing equipmentfor renewable energy production, carried out for industry bodiesBEE and AEE, found that 80 percent expect turnover to rise eachyear by 2014, with over half hoping for double-digit growth. Some 4 billion euros will be invested in new productioncapacity in Germany this year, the survey found. The survey was completed in early March before the nucleardisaster in Japan prompted the German government to revise itsplans on extending the lifespans of the country's 17 nuclearreactors. Officials said that should boost growth even further. "We'll most probably have to adjust the findings upwards ifthe government is serious about changing its energy strategy," BEE managing director Bjoern Klusmann told a news conference."We could easily ramp up production to be able to replacenuclear energy in Germany by 2020 at the latest." Chancellor Angela Merkel's government passed legislationlast year to extend the lifespan of the 17 nuclear reactors byan average of 12 years beyond a previous 2022 cut-off date. But after the Japanese nuclear disaster, Merkel retreatedand declared a three-month moratorium on the extensions. Shealso temporarily shut seven older plants. That upset her party'sbusiness wing and did not impress voters in Baden-Wuerttemberg,where the CDU suffered a major election defeat on Sunday. German firms are among world leaders in renewable energy andmaking equipment used for machines that turn wind and sunshineinto electricity. The country gets 17 percent of its electricityfrom renewables and aims to raise that to 40 percent by 2020. Germany overtook the United States to move into second placebehind China in clean-energy investment last year, according toa report released on Tuesday called "Who's Winning the Cleanenergy Race" by the Pew Charitable Trusts. A total of $41.2 billion was invested  in renewable energyin Germany last year, the survey found, compared with $54.4billion invested in China and $34 billion in the United States.
