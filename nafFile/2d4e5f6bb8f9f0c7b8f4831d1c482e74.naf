<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds economists' comments) By Jan Strupczewski BRUSSELS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - More expensive fuel pushed up euro zone consumer prices as expected in September, data showedon Friday, but core inflation remained subdued, showing that economic recovery has not yet boosted price pressures. Separately, data showed the 16 countries using the euroswung to an external trade deficit in August from a surplus inJuly as both exports and imports rose, but imports marginallymore so, in a sign of sustained external and domestic demand. The European Union's statistics office Eurostat saidconsumer inflation in the euro zone was 0.2 percentmonth-on-month, and confirmed its earlier estimate thatyear-on-year prices grew 1.8 percent. This is right on the European Central Bank's price stabilitytarget of below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term. "September's rise in inflation was primarily due tounfavourable energy base effects and it does little to dilutethe view that inflation is not a significant problem in the eurozone," said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. The price growth was mainly a result of a 7.7 percent annualjump in energy prices, with fuels for transport contributing 0.4percentage points of the total 1.8 percent annual rise andheating oil adding another 0.16 percentage point. Removing volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, thecore inflation measure showed prices grew only 1.0 percentyear-on-year, the same as in August and July.  "Euro zone consumer price inflation could edge up a littlefurther in the near term due to unfavourable energy base effectsand higher food prices, but it should remain moderate and willlikely be largely below 2 percent in 2011," Archer said. "With euro zone growth likely to be relatively muted andbumpy over the coming months in the face of serious headwinds,and unemployment likely to stay relatively high, underlyinginflationary pressures seem set to remain contained," he added. "Furthermore, the euro's current strength will dampeninflationary pressures," Archer said. The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.4089 on Friday, just shyof an eight-month peak of $1.4123 hit on Thursday. Eurostat said that the euro zone's external trade balance inAugust swung to a 4.3 billion euro deficit from adownward-revised 6.2 billion surplus in July. Year-on-year, unadjusted exports surged 31 percent in Augustwhile imports jumped 32 percent, Eurostat said. Adjusted for seasonal swings, exports grew 1 percentmonth-on-month in August and imports rose 1.8 percent and all ofthe euro zone's top four economies -- Germany, France, Italy andSpain -- recorded a deterioration in their trade balances. Despite the euro's sharp rise in the last month, economistsnote that exchange rates affect trade much less than economicgrowth-linked demand and that currency weakness or strength onlyhas an impact with a time lag of several months. "The last three months (from June to August) are about 6percent above the preceding three months for both imports andexports, pointing to dynamic activity during the summer," saidDominique Barbet, economist at BNP Paribas. "We do not expect the euro's sharp appreciation to have amaterial adverse impact on foreign trade before next year," hesaid.
