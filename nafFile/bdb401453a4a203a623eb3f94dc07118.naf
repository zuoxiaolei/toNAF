<raw><![CDATA[ BRUSSELS, March 29 (Reuters) - An overhaul of the globalmonetary system by the world's top 20 economies should entail abigger role for the IMF's SDR reserve asset and the inclusion ofChina's renminbi in the Special Drawing Rights, the influentialBrussels-based Bruegel think tank said. In a paper by the Bruegel's head Jean Pisany-Ferry, AgnesBenassy-Quere of France's CEPII think tank and Yu Yongding, aformer academic adviser to China's central bank, the threeeconomists said the overhaul should also include internationalmonitoring of exchange rates and stronger financial safety nets. The call comes before G20 finance ministers and centralbankers meet in mid-April in Washington, where the internationalmonetary system will be one of the topics discussed. A basket of four currencies -- the dollar, euro, poundsterling and Japanese yen -- make up the International MonetaryFund's Special Drawing Rights which can be used as aninternational reserve asset. Created in 1969, SDRs do not reflect the rise of China tobecome the second biggest economy in the world after the UnitedStates. The world's 20 biggest developing and developed economies,the G20, are discussing ways to overhaul the global monetarysystem to adjust it to changing realities and prevent economicand financial crises. The three economists said there was little chance of a grandredesign of the monetary system in the short term, but concretesteps should still be taken. G20 leaders will meet to discussthe issue in France in November. "First, consensus is needed on exchange rates, capital flowsand reserves. This consensus is closer than often assumed, andshould be codified in some form of soft law, with provisions forsurveillance agreed on," the economists said. "Second, financial safety nets must be improved so thatcountries do not have to self-insure by accumulating reserves.The least difficult route could be a new regime for deciding onSpecial Drawing Right allocations that would facilitate morefrequent use of this instrument," they said. "Third, a change in the composition of the SDR should beplanned for, to strengthen the multilateral framework byincluding the renminbi. These reforms would be a partial move,and would prepare the ground for further developments." Many G20 countries would like to see the Chinese currencyincluded in the SDR basket as a way of better engaging China inglobal economic governance, but not before Beijing allows theexchange rate of the mow managed currency to be set by themarket.  A free float of the yuan would entail its appreciation andChina is reluctant to allow this to happen too quickly for fearof killing off its vibrant exports sector. "We suggest adapting the existing SDR to the new globalenvironment through more frequent allocations, and by planningthe inclusion of the renminbi in the SDR basket in the contextof an opening up of China's financial account and a move towardsa flexible exchange-rate regime in China," the paper said. The three economists also said the role of the SDRs, ofwhich there are 204 billion currently in issue ($318 billion),should be expanded with more allocations of the asset to IMFmembers. "They would provide countries with SDR reserves that theycould exchange for reserves denominated in the currency of theirchoice," the paper said.  "If provided in limited volumes and in response toincreases in the demand for reserves only, such allocationswould be unlikely to have far-reaching consequences for globalliquidity while providing a welcome buffer for vulnerablecountries," the economists said.
