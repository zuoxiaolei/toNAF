<raw><![CDATA[ * Japan's Nikkei down 3.6 pct after heavy US, Europeanlosses * US Treasury futures near highest since Dec 2008 * Gold remains soft as investors sell to cover losses * Japan sells record Y4 trln in FX intervention-Nikkei (Adds quotes, updates prices)	 By Kevin Plumberg	 SINGAPORE, Aug 5 (Reuters) - - Asian stocks tumbled as muchas 5 percent on Friday after panic triggered the worst sell-offon Wall Street since the global financial crisis, promptinginvestors to slash positions and scramble for cash andgovernment bonds.	 Fears that the U.S. economy is sliding back toward recessionand a recent jumpe in Italian and Spanish bond yields towardsdanger levels have driven investors to seek cover.	 U.S. stock futures  were slightly higher after majorU.S. markets fell by 4-5 percent overnight, but employmentfigures due later in the day could trigger further selling ifthe jobs picture disappoints. 	 Complicating matters was that Japan and Switzerland haveintervened this week to weaken their currencies, which wereconsidered the safest in the developed world. That has causedsome safety-seeking investors to think twice about stashingmoney there when financial market volatility is spiking.	 So far, retail investors were participating in the heavyselling but institutional equity investors in Asia were notcompletely liquidating their positions, instead continuing tocut riskier bets and protect their portfolios.	 "What you're seeing is a shakeout of all the money that wasput to work in the hope that 2011 turns out like last year,where you saw a nice bounce around the same time," said a HongKong-based multi-strategy hedge fund manager. 	 "That could still happen but with the losses that peoplehave already taken this year, looks like no wants to take therisk. It's about preserving capital now." 	  Japan's Nikkei share average fell 3.4 percent to thelowest since the week following the country's massive earthquakeand tsunami in March.  	 The benchmark MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outsideJapan was down 3.8 percent , with investorsselling across the sectors, whether they are defensive orcyclical. The index is on course for the biggest weekly dropsince May 2010, when the European debt crisis was flaring up. 	 "Clearly, it's just a knee-jerk reaction to what's goingon," said Michael Heffernan, senior client advisor with AustockGroup in Australia. "We're going down simply on the fear thatItaly can't pay its debts." 	 Within Asia, markets with high trade exposure to the Westand reliance on commodities looked particularly vulnerable.	 Taiwan, where the technology sector makes up about half ofthe equity market capitalisation and depends heavily on exportsto developed countries, is a weak point in Asia.	 The benchmark stock index in Taiwan led Asia, falling 5percent .      	 Europe, where overloaded national balance sheets havebedeviled politicians struggling to grasp the implications, iscurrently in the eye of the storm. 	 Italian and Spanish bond yields have kept rising and Germanbond yields falling, widening spreads the most since the eurowas born and causing deep-seated fears about what elsepolicymakers can do to keep the euro zone together.	 The European Central Bank resumed buying government bondsafter a four-month break and announced new longer-term fundingfor liquidity-starved banks, investors kept selling peripheralEuropean bonds.	 Traders went warily back to the yen. The dollar was down 0.4percent to 78.83 yen , a day after Japan reportedly spenta record 4 trillion yen ($50.6 billion) to weaken its currencyand bolster its export competitiveness. 	 U.S. 10-year Treasury futures ticked up 6/32 to 128-6/32, just below the Thursday high of 128-12/32, which was thehighest since December 2008. The cash yield was at 2.42 percent , a basis point higher than late New York onThursday when the 10-year yield hit the lowest since October2010.	 The yield has sank 37 basis points so far in August, as awall of worry sends investors to the most liquid bond market inthe world.	 Commodity markets extended heavy overnight losses on fearsof slowing demand.	 U.S. crude for September delivery  fell 1 percent to$85.75 a barrel after plunging as much as 6 percent on Thursdayand closing at the lowest since February 2011.	 In an ominous sign, gold prices were soft despite thespiralling fears hurting risky markets. Investors were having tosell gold positions to cover losses elsewhere in theirportfolios.	 Spot gold prices eased $3.71 an ounce to $1,644.19after hitting a record around $1,681 an ounce on Thursday beforelosing some of the gains.   	 "This will not be a quiet day. Liquidity will be at apremium," a sales trader with a European bank said.			 (Editing by Kim Coghill)	              ]]></raw>
