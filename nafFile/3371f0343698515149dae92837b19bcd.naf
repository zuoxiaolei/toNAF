<raw><![CDATA[ * Exports to start on Feb 1 at 100,000 bpd * Contracts legality, payments to be discussed later * Kurdish oil exports held since 2009  (Updates with govt spokesman) By Shamal Aqrawi ARBIL, Iraq, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Iraq's semi-autonomousKurdish region agreed with Baghdad to resume oil exports at thestart of February, officials said, taking the two sides closerto resolving bitter disputes over oil and land. Around 40 companies, such as Norway's DNO, have invested inKurdistan, but revenues have been curtailed by their inabilityto sell oil for export, because Baghdad has deemed the contractsthey signed unconstitutional. The news of a possible resumption in exports sent shares ofDNO up as much as 6 percent on Tuesday. Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told Reuters onTuesday a deal had been reached with the Kurds to resume exportson Feb. 1, starting at 100,000 barrels per day, but issues likepaying the companies were still to be resolved. The office of the Kurdish prime minister, Barham Salih, saidearlier in a statement sent to Reuters the resumption of oilexports from the region was agreed in a meeting on Monday withIraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. Iraq said last May it had approved a deal with the Kurds andexpected Kurdish oil exports to resume quickly. Exports remainedblocked, however, while negotiations over forming a newgovernment after a March election continued. Last year's deal between the central government and the KRGinvolved the Ministry of Finance in Baghdad paying foreign oilfirms operating in Iraqi Kurdistan their expenses but notcovering profits. Dabbagh said all issues related to the Kurdish contractssigned with international oil firms working in the region, andhow the companies will be paid, will be discussed later. "We have agreed... to discuss the issue of the region'scontracts at a later stage within the constitutional framework,"he said, when asked about the terms of the deal. The statement from Salih's office said the deal on oil waspart of a broader agreement to resolve all outstanding issuesbetween Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). One of the other issues is the inclusion in Iraq's draftbudget for 2011 of a clause cutting the funds paid to the KRG ifit does not export an average of 150,000 barrels per day thisyear. The budget has not been approved yet by parliament, andthe proposed clause drove Kurdish lawmakers to walk out inprotest on its first reading last month. If oil exports resume from the Kurdish region, flows wouldbe about 100,000 bpd and could reach 250,000 bpd by the end ofthe year, Kurdish Natural Resources Minister Ashti Hawrami hassaid. Kurdish exports from two fields -- Taq Taq and Tawke --flowed briefly in 2009 but were halted when the Iraqi governmentrefused to pay the oil companies working the fields, includingDNO and Turkey's Genel Enerji. DNO stands ready to export around 50,000 bpd if a deal isconcluded. Currently it is confined to selling around 17,000 bpdto the local Kurdish market, where it receives less than halfthe international price for its oil. Other companies including London-listed Gulf Keystone,Heritage Oil and Genel have also made large discoveries in theregion.  LOGGERHEADS The Oil Ministry in Baghdad has opposed independent dealssigned between the companies and the KRG authorities,considering them illegal. Iraqi Kurdistan and Baghdad have been at loggerheads overmany thorny issues, which U.S. officials fear could be the sparkof Iraq's next major conflict just as the sectarian bloodshedfades and as U.S. troops prepare to withdraw this year. At the heart of the tensions lie disputed territoriesincluding the oil city of Kirkuk, which Kurds want to havewrapped into their northern region. Iraq exports the majority of its oil from its southernfields around the city of Basra at an average of more than 1.5million bpd now. Oil from the Kirkuk fields provides another400,000 bpd or so in exports. Baghdad's hand against the Kurds has been strengthened by aseries of oil deals involving fields outside the Kurdish region,which could turn Iraq into one of the world's top crudeexporters. The deals could boost Iraq's output potential to 12 millionbarrels per day in seven years from around 2.7 million bpd now.
