<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro up 0.5 percent at $1.5120 * Trichet, ECB forecasts awaited for hints on future policy * BofA news triggers risk appetite, pushes dollar down * Yen pulls further away from 14-yr highs vs dollar  (Adds ECB decision, adds quotes, updates prices) By Tamawa Desai LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The euro held earlier gainsagainst the dollar on Thursday after the European Central Bankleft interest rates steady, as expected. Traders are focusing on what ECB President Jean-ClaudeTrichet will say about scaling back the central bank's emergencylending measures. The ECB chief has dropped a number of hintsthat this month's handout of one-year loans would be the last. Also in focus are the ECB's new staff forecasts, which areexpected to show a solid upward revision to economic growth nextyear, but for the inflation outlook to remain subdued throughthe following year. By 1253 GMT, the euro was up half of a percent at $1.5120,near the day's high around $1.5130 and within sight of a16-month high of $1.5145. Analysts say Trichet has to walk a fine line, as any hintsof a rate rise would prompt traders to bid up the euro,especially as the U.S. Federal Reserve has said it would keeprates low for an extended time. "A more hawkish tone would lead to an even stronger euro, sothe ECB would likely want to have as little impact on the euroas possible," said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank ofTokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. On the 12-month tender, there had been some speculation theECB may index the 12-month rate or add a spread, which would beeuro positive, analysts at RBC Capital markets said. Another possibility is a cut in the frequency of 3-month and6-month funding operations which would be moderately europositive, they said. The ECB kept its main interest rate on hold at a record lowof 1 percent for the seventh month running. It also kept itsovernight deposit rate, which acts as a floor for money markets,at 0.25 percent and left its marginal lending rate at 1.75percent.  YEN FALTERS The euro gained sharply against the yen, rising 1.0 percenton the day to 132.92 yen. The yen has been on the decline after the Bank of Japandecided to provide new three-month funding at a fixed rate tocombat deflation, in an emergency policy meeting on Wednesday. BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the central bank doesnot target foreign exchange for monetary policy but "if thebank's easy stance becomes widely known in markets, it will havecertain effects on the currency market in the long run." The dollar pulled further away from a 14-year low of 84.82yen on reports Japan's top Finance Ministry official forcurrencies met U.S. Treasury officials earlier in the week,increasing speculation Tokyo might act to slow the yen's rise. The finance ministry controls currency policy in Japan; theBOJ merely acts as its agent in the market. Meanwhile, the dollar fell broadly on renewed risk appetiteafter Bank of America said it would repay U.S. governmentbailout money. The dollar index, which measures the greenback's performanceagainst a currency basket, was down 0.3 percent. A rise in European shares and oil prices boosted demand forrisk, while gold hit a record high for the third straightsession. This helped to boost higher-yielding, commodity-basedcurrencies including the Australian and New Zealand dollars,which both rose 0.5 percent on the day. Traders will also watch Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke'sreconfirmation hearing later in the day.
