<raw><![CDATA[ * Hungary govt likely to impose tax on banks -portal Index * Pension fund flows into budget opposed by lenders -Index * Tax cuts this year expected to be symbolic * PM Orban expected to announce fiscal plans at 1100 GMT  (Adds details, background) BUDAPEST, June 8 (Reuters) - Hungary's government has likelyabandoned the idea of channelling private pension funds into thestate budget as a form of raising extra revenues due toopposition from the IMF and EU, news portal Index said onTuesday. Citing several unnamed sources, Index said the governmentis, however, likely to go ahead with a plan of imposing somekind of special tax on banks' profits. Daily newspaper Nepszabadsag also said the government wasunlikely to try to channel private pension funds into the budgetand thereby reduce the budget deficit as it strives to limitthis year's fiscal gap to 3.8 percent of GDP. Prime Minister Viktor Orban is expected to outline plans tothe ruling Fidesz party's lawmakers at a meeting later in theday and after that he is expected to announce the plans toparliament at 1100 GMT. Hungary's centre-right government promised to cut spendingon Monday as it sought to repair damage from comments last weekabout a possible Greece-style debt crisis, as analysts said itwill take months to rebuild policy credibility. [ID:nLDE6560XG] Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy said on Monday the newgovernment, in office since May 29, would stick to a budgetdeficit target of 3.8 percent this year and would need to cutspending by 1.0-1.5 percent of gross domestic product. Index said on Tuesday that the government had most probablydropped the idea of a shift in the pension system as thecountry's lenders the International Monetary Fund and the EU didnot approve the proposal. The first tier of Hungary's pension system is a publiclymanaged, pay-as-you-go financed social security pension scheme,which covers all employees and the self-employed.Under a reform of the pension system in 1997 Hungaryintroduced a second funded tier, causing a deficit in the firsttier when a proportion of the contributions were redirectedto mandatory private pension funds. By bringing these funds under the umbrella of the statebudget the government could have reduced the deficit sharply, byhundreds of billions of forints per year but several analystssaid such a move would likely not have been received well bymarkets. Index also said that this year's tax cuts would be mostlysymbolic. However, a new tax on banks' and other financial firms'profits could bring over 100 billion forints ($417 million) intostate coffers, the website said. The bank tax talk sent the shares of Hungary's leadinglender OTP Bank  into a tailspin on Monday but thestock clawed back ground later in the day. Morgan Stanley upgraded OTP Bank to 'Equal' from'Underweight' as the share price fell below its mark-to-marketimplied price target of 5,000 forints, the investment bank saidin a note on Tuesday. The forint  traded at 285.80 versus the euro at0631 GMT, up from an opening level of 287.55 in thin trade. (Reporting by Krisztina Than; editing by John Stonestreet)             ]]></raw>
