<raw><![CDATA[ * Sterling rises briefly to 3-week high of $1.6275 * BoE minutes show more hawkish 6-3 split for no rate change * Sterling upside hampered by long positioning By Neal Armstrong LONDON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Sterling rose against the dollarand the euro on Wednesday after Bank of England minutes forFebruary showed a hawkish tone, with three members of theMonetary Policy Committee voting for a rise in interest rates. Bank of England Chief Economist Spencer Dale joined AndrewSentance and Martin Weale in voting for higher rates inFebruary, minutes of the BoE's Feb. 9-10 meeting showed. Moreover, the minutes also suggested that some of thoseopposed to a rate hike this month would consider it if theeconomy shows signs of picking up after an unexpected fall inoutput at the end of 2010. "It doesn't necessarily mean that the committee is that muchcloser to putting interest rates up,  but certainly thesentiment expressed in the main headlines from the minutes ismore hawkish than expected," said Philip Shaw, chief economistat Investec. Sterling rose around half a U.S. cent to trade at $1.6275,its highest since Feb 3. It faltered ahead of this year's peakat $1.6279 and slipped back to stand at $1.6213, up around 0.5percent on the day. Traders highlighted a sizeable option expiryat $1.6170 which could influence the day's price action. The euro fell around 30 pips to a session low of 84.22pence, moving back under its 200-day moving average at 84.47. Itwas last trading at 84.46, down 0.2 percent on the day. Analysts said the recent build-up of long positioning in thepound amid rising interest rate expectations meant further gainswould be more difficult to come by. The market continues to expect a 25 basis point increase inJune of this year, with an outside chance it could come as earlyas May.  "The upside looks more difficult for sterling because ratehike expectations won't have been brought forward too muchfurther by the minutes," said Jane Foley, senior currencystrategist at Rabobank. "Sterling will now be more vulnerable to negative economicnews as it has risen a long way already." The second estimate of fourth quarter growth due on Fridaywill be of particular importance after the first estimate showedthat Britain's economy unexpectedly shrank in the last threemonths of 2010. The government blamed the drop in output on the harshestDecember weather on record. But some economists say recent revisions to industrialproduction and construction output cancel each other out andmost expect no change to the GDP figure this time.
