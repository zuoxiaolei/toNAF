<raw><![CDATA[ * Plutonium found in soil at Fukushima complex * Radiation increases, bad news piles up from site * Plant operator seeks help from French companies * Over 28,000 people dead or missing from March 11 disaster   (Adds details) By Yoko Nishikawa TOKYO, March 29 (Reuters) - Plutonium found in soil at thecrippled Fukushima nuclear complex heightened alarm on Tuesdayover Japan's protracted battle to contain the world's worstatomic crisis in 25 years. Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co <9501.T (TEPCO) saidthe radioactive material, a by-product of atomic reactions andalso used in nuclear bombs, was traced in soil at five locationsat the complex, hit by an earthquake and tsunami on March 11. The drama at the six-reactor facility has compounded theAsian nation's agony after the natural disasters left more than28,000 people dead or missing in the devastated northeast. "I apologise for making people worried," Sakae Muto,vice-president of under-pressure TEPCO, said at a briefingaround midnight in Tokyo.  Yet he stressed the traces of plutonium 238, 239 and 240were not dangerous and work would not be stopped. "It's not at the level that's harmful to human health." Muto said the readings were similar to those found in thepast in other parts of Japan due to particles carried in theatmosphere after nuclear testing abroad. TEPCO said it was unclear where the plutonium was from,though it appeared two of the five finds were related to damagefrom the plant rather than from the atmosphere. Experts believe that as well as from the air, plutonium mayhave come from spent fuel rods at Fukushima or damage to reactorNo. 3, the only one to use plutonium in its fuel mix.    U.N. watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) IAEA, said the find was expected due to known fueldegradation. The U.N. body has called a summit, possibly in June, tocoordinate the international response to mounting concern overnuclear safety in the wake of Japan's crisis. Japan's own nuclear safety agency was concerned at theplutonium samples which ranged from 0.18-0.54 becquerels per kg. "While it's not the level harmful to human health, I am notoptimistic. This means the containment mechanism is beingbreached so I think the situation is worrisome," agency officialHidehiko Nishiyama was quoted as saying by Jiji news agency. The plutonium discovery, from samples taken a week ago, wasthe latest bad news from the Fukushima plant where engineers areresigned to a protracted struggle of weeks or possibly months toreestablish cooling systems vital to control the reactors. On Monday, TEPCO said highly reactive water showing 1,000millisieverts per hour had been found in concrete tunnels thatextend beyond one reactor. Fires, blasts and leaks have forced engineers to stop workat times, including at the weekend when radiation spiked to100,000 times above normal in water inside reactor No. 2. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said a partial meltdownof fuel rods inside the reactor vessel was responsible.  APOCALYPTIC SCENES With Japan's towns and villages in the northeast coastreduced to apocalyptic landscapes of mud and debris, more than aquarter of a million people are homeless. The cost of damagecould top $300 billion, the world's costliest natural disaster. Environmental group Greenpeace said its experts hadconfirmed dangerous radiation of up to 10 microsieverts per hourin Iitate village, 40 km (25 miles) northwest of the plant. It called for the extension of a 20-km (12-mile) evacuationzone. "It is clearly not safe for people to remain in Iitate,especially children and pregnant women, when it could meanreceiving the maximum allowed annual dose of radiation in only afew days," Greenpeace said in a statement. It urged Tokyo to "stop choosing politics over science". More than 177,000 people have been evacuated from an areawithin 20 km (12 miles) of the plant and people within a zoneextending a further 10 km are told by the government to stayindoors or, better still, leave too. Beyond the evacuation zone, traces of radiation have beenfound in tap water in Tokyo and as far away as Iceland. Japanese officials and international experts have generallysaid the levels away from the plant were not dangerous forpeople, who in any case face higher radiation doses on a dailybasis from natural sources, X-rays or flying.  LEADERSHIP PROBLEMS TEPCO, which has conceded it faces a long and uncertainoperation to contain the crisis, sought outside help from Frenchfirms including Electricite de France SA and Areva SA, a Frenchgovernment minister said. Japan is also seeking American help, said Robin Grimes, headof the centre for nuclear engineering at Imperial College inLondon. "Each country has its own expertise." Mark Prelas, a professor of nuclear engineering atUniversity of Missouri in the United States, warned againstoverreaction to the fast-moving events in Japan. "It's worth remembering that millions of Americans in thewest of the country would have been exposed to tiny traces ofplutonium during the above ground bomb tests prior to the1960s," he said. The risk of a core meltdown had receded, he added, andhopefully water pumps would be restarted in the next couple ofweeks to get the reactors into a safe "cold shutdown" stage. "From what I've seen so far, what has been released so farwould not require the exclusion zone to become permanent. Idon't think that's realistic. The eventual clean-up still lookslike it should be easily manageable," he added. The crisis has put huge pressure on TEPCO, which has beencriticised for safety lapses at the plant and a slow response tothe disaster. Its boss Masataka Shimizu has barely been seen. Prime Minister Naota Kan, leading Japan during its worstcrisis since World War Two, has been similarly low-profile. Even though Japan's culture stresses group efficiency overindividual charisma, many are unhappy and a weekend poll showedtwo-thirds of people felt Kan was not showing leadership. "The characters involved are too weak to take decisiveactions," said Jesper Koll, analyst at JP Morgan Securities.
