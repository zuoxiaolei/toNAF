<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was broadly higher against most of its major counterparts on Friday, as the lack of progress on a sovereign bailout for Spain dented market sentiment, as European leaders began a second day of talks in Brussels. During European early afternoon trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD shedding 0.20% to 1.3041. Expectations that Spain will ask for a sovereign bailout has underpinned demand for the euro over recent days, but uncertainty about when such a request might come has made investors wary of driving the single currency much higher. Meeting on Thursday in Brussels, European leaders made some progress towards establishing a single banking supervisor for the currency bloc, but, as expected, talked little about immediate plans for debt-ridden problem members, Spain and Greece. Also Friday, official data showed that producer price inflation in Germany rose in line with expectations in September, ticking up 0.03% after a 0.05% rise the previous month. The greenback was steady against the pound, with GBP/USD inching up 0.01% to 1.6046. Official data earlier showed that public sector net borrowing in the U.K. fell unexpectedly in September, declining to GBP10.7 billion from GBP10.8 billion the previous month. Analysts had expected public sector net borrowing to rise to GBP11.4 billion in September. Elsewhere, the greenback was lower against the yen, with USD/JPY slipping 0.12% lower to hit 79.17, but higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF rising 0.23% to trade at 0.9268.  Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa warned on Friday that slowing overseas growth is weighing on business sentiment and may hurt capital spending, signalling readiness to expand monetary stimulus further to support a fragile economy. In addition, the greenback was mixed to higher against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD adding 0.23% to 0.9875, AUD/USD easing 0.08% to 1.0359 and NZD/USD inching up 0.09% to hit 0.8191. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.13%, to trade at 79.52. Later in the day, the U.S. was to produce industry data on existing home sales.             ]]></raw>
