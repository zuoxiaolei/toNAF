<raw><![CDATA[ * C$ up at 95.58 U.S. cents * Bonds flat across the curve TORONTO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar extendedgains on Thursday morning, touching its highest level in nearlythree weeks, as the unit rose on broad weakness in the U.S.dollar. With marginal moves in global equity, oil and gold prices,the Canadian dollar is largely being swayed by moves in thegreenback, said Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist atRBC Capital Markets. It's "just reaction to a broad-based U.S. dollar selloff,"Strauss said. The greenback fell on Thursday, coming off three-monthhighs against a basket of currencies after weak U.S. housingdata in the previous session dampened optimism about theoutlook for the U.S. economy. [FRX/] In thin pre-holiday trade, investors awaited U.S. weeklyjobless claims and durable goods data. World stocks pushed to their highest level in nearly threeweeks, while oil prices sagged and gold edged slightly higher.[MKTS/GLOB] [O/R] [GOL/] The Canadian dollar also built on momentum after commentsby Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, who said that China andRussia may diversify their currency reserves into Canadiandollars. [FRX/] Those comments built on remarks by Prime Minister StephenHarper that Ottawa will be fiscally disciplined as thegovernment continues stimulus spending until 2011. "It clearly seems as if Canada is back in favor and is theflavor of the month in the currency world, so the markets arequick to latch on to positive Canadian dollar news," saidStrauss. The Canadian dollar touched its highest level since earlyDecember. At 7:56 a.m. (1256 GMT), the Canadian dollar was atC$1.0462 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.58 U.S. cents, up fromWednesday's finish at C$1.0484 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.38U.S. cents. With no major domestic economic data on tap, Canadian bondprices were largely flat across the curve as investors wereunwilling to make major bets in holiday-shortened trade.
