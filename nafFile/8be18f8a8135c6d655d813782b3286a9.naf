<raw><![CDATA[ * Markets seek clarity on who will rule Britain * Britain has no recent experience of coalition-building * Solid Lib-Con coalition clear preference over minority (Updates with talks end for Sunday, meeting again Monday) By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Markets will open on Mondaywithout clarity on who will govern Britain, with a workablecoalition rather than unstable minority rule needed to pacifyinvestors jittery over the euro zone's Greek debt crisis. Sterling, gilts and stocks all sold off on Friday after theopposition Conservatives failed to win an outright majority inThursday's elections, leaving Labour Prime Minister Gordon Browndefeated but still in power and third-party Liberal Democrats askingmakers. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats held talks over theweekend to try to put together a government, but while delegatessaid progress had been made they failed to reach an outrightagreement but will meet again on Monday. Both Conservative leader David Cameron and Lib Dem leaderNick Clegg face an uphill task selling any deal to theirrespective parties. Investors wanting swift action on Britain'srecord deficit are unlikely to be particularly patient. "I think the markets will give them a nudge on Monday andthen a much larger nudge on Tuesday," said David Lea, WesternEurope analyst at consultancy Control Risks. "It really has tobe sorted out by Monday night." Asian markets will be the first to digest the weekend news,while London markets could be buffeted by new statements andappearances by party officials on early morning television andradio. "Market reaction on Monday ... will depend in significantpart on what the parties are saying publicly," said AlistairNewton, political analyst and managing director at Nomura. If both parties were sending positive messages suggestingthey had a basic agreement on the principles of a coalition butneeded time to cement details, markets could react positively.  But negativity, conflict and intransigence could alarmmarkets wanting a strong government to begin tackling Britain'srecord deficit. Some analysts took heart from Conservative andLib Dem statements saying there was common ground on the economyand deficit reduction. "I don't think the market was expecting a deal by (Monday)opening," said Eurasia Group analyst Wolfango Piccoli. "Thepoliticians are being very positive and responsible. By talkingabout the deficit, they are sending the right signal." Denied a decisive election outcome, most analysts say themost stable outcome would be a Lib-Con coalition rather than alooser arrangement with the Lib Dems providing parliamentarysupport from outside the government. Nevertheless, some analysts said the most likely outcome wasthe latter, with the Lib Dems agreeing not to vote down keypolicies, particularly the budget, but with differences overelectoral reform -- a key Lib Dem goal largely opposed by theConservatives -- preventing a coalition. Such negotiations are common in European politics butBritain has not seen a hung parliament since 1974.  UNSTABLE MINORITY? Analysts say the average length of time to form a Europeancoalition is 40 days, but with markets already nervous oversovereign debt worries given the crisis in Greece and othersouthern euro economies few believe Britain has such a luxury. The new government is due to set out its legislativeprogramme in the Queen's Speech to parliament on May 25.Investors and credit ratings agencies will watch closely. "The UK's relatively high debt ratios and large deficitscould result in the UK becoming a bad-weather version of ClubMed debt markets," said ING in a research note on Friday, usinga standard shorthand for the troubled economies of Italy,Greece, Portugal and Spain and underlining that Britain might benext in the firing line. Conservative leader David Cameron could try to push ahead asa minority government with the support of a handful of UlsterUnionists, and the Lib Dems agreeing to protect him against ano-confidence vote to allow a budget through. But markets fear this option would prove inherently unstableand might simply be too weak to tackle public spending,potentially endangering Britain's AAA credit rating. "I think investors would react negatively to a minoritygovernment given the risk that a no-confidence vote could emergein parliament before year-end," said Simon Derrick, head ofcurrency strategy at Bank of New York Mellon. Some analysts, however, argue no party would risk forcing ano-confidence vote for fear of being punished by the electoratefor a market crash. The sheer uncertainty makes markets favour a broadercoalition. If the Lib Dems and Conservatives proved unable to form acoalition, one could potentially be put together by the LibDems, Labour and multiple other smaller parties includingScottish and Welsh nationalists. Brown and Clegg met on Sunday, a potential sign that the LibDems were keeping their options open. But any Lib-Lab-Others coalition would barely have amajority and investors would likely be lukewarm at best.             ]]></raw>
