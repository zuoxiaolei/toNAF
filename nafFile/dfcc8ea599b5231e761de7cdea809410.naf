<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar broadly weak ahead of Obama speech, FOMC * Fall in U.S. yields undermines dollar * Pound extends loss on surprisingly weak UK GDP By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The dollar held near a 10-week lowagainst a basket of currencies on Wednesday, with the marketlooking for confirmation from the Federal Reserve later in theday that its focus remains on supporting growth. The perception that the Fed will keep a much easier policythan the European Central Bank, which is growing worried aboutinflation, has helped boost the euro to near a two-month high. The dollar extended losses for a third day on Tuesday whenU.S. bond yields fell on the news that President Barack Obamawill propose a partial freeze on federal spending in his State ofUnion address to the U.S. Congress due at 0200 GMT. "U.S. bond yields fell yesterday so I'm not sure how muchfurther they are going to fall after the FOMC. But, on the whole,sentiment for the dollar seems weak," said a trader at a Japanesebank. The dollar index against a basket of major currencies stoodat 77.946, just above a 10-week low of 77.814 hit earlier in theweek. Analysts expect the U.S. central bank will keep short-termrates near zero and will say it remains committed to its $600billion bond purchase programme, known as QE2. The dollar's recent decline came as the euro recovers fromfour-month low hit earlier this month, helped as worries abouteuro zone periphery countries' debt problems ease and by talk ofpossible credit tightening by the ECB later in the year. The euro stood at $1.3680, near a two-month high of $1.3705hit on Tuesday, and within sight of a 61.8 percent retracement ofits November-January fall around $1.3740. Beyond that, its Nov. 22 high of $1.3786 is seen as a majortarget. "It doesn't seem like there are stretched euro long positionsin the market. I see more upside for the euro," said anotherJapanese bank trader. The British pound extended losses after a shockingcontraction in the UK economy in the fourth quarter promptedinvestors to scale back expectations of a rate hike by the Bankof England. The pound fell 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.5780,near Tuesday's low of $1.5750. Against a resurgent euro, thepound was near 2-1/2-month low of 0.86695 per euro hit onTuesday. It last traded at 0.86605. The dollar was little moved against the yen at 82.25 yen, notfar from last week's two-week low of 81.85 yen. It fell below thebottom of the daily ichimoku cloud, now at 82.36, which isconsidered as a major bear signal. (Additional reporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)             ]]></raw>
