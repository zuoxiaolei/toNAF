<raw><![CDATA[ Reforming compensation practices to support financialstability:Excessive compensation in the financial sector has bothreflected and encouraged excessive risk taking. Reformingcompensation policies and practices is an essential part of oureffort to increase financial stability. We fully endorse theimplementation standards of the FSB aimed at aligningcompensation with long-term value creation, not excessiverisk-taking, including by (i) avoiding multi-year guaranteedbonuses; (ii) requiring a significant portion of variablecompensation to be deferred, tied to performance and subject toappropriate clawback and to be vested in the form of stock orstock-like instruments, as long as these create incentivesaligned with long-term value creation and the time horizon ofrisk; (iii) ensuring that compensation for senior executivesand other employees having a material impact on the firm's riskexposure align with performance and risk; (iv) making firms'compensation policies and structures transparent throughdisclosure requirements; (v) limiting variable compensation asa percentage of total net revenues when it is inconsistent withthe maintenance of a sound capital base; and (vi) ensuring thatcompensation committees overseeing compensation policies areable to act independently. Supervisors should have theresponsibility to review firms' compensation policies andstructures with institutional and systemic risk in mind and, ifnecessary to offset additional risks, apply correctivemeasures, such as higher capital requirements, to those firmsthat fail to implement sound compensation policies andpractices. Supervisors should have the ability to modifycompensation structures in the case of firms that fail orrequire extraordinary public intervention. We call on firms toimplement these sound compensation practices immediately. Wetask the FSB to monitor the implementation of FSB standards andpropose additional measures as required by March 2010.Improving over-the-counter derivatives markets: Allstandardized OTC derivative contracts should be traded onexchanges or electronic trading platforms, where appropriate,and cleared through central counterparties by end-2012 at thelatest. OTC derivative contracts should be reported to traderepositories. Non-centrally cleared contracts should be subjectto higher capital requirements. We ask the FSB and its relevantmembers to assess regularly implementation and whether it issufficient to improve transparency in the derivatives markets,mitigate systemic risk, and protect against market abuse.Addressing cross-border resolutions and systemically importantfinancial institutions by end-2010: Systemically importantfinancial firms should develop internationally-consistentfirm-specific contingency and resolution plans. Our authoritiesshould establish crisis management groups for the majorcross-border firms and a legal framework for crisisintervention as well as improve information sharing in times ofstress. We should develop resolution tools and frameworks forthe effective resolution of financial groups to help mitigatethe disruption of financial institution failures and reducemoral hazard in the future. Our prudential standards forsystemically important institutions should be commensurate withthe costs of their failure. The FSB should propose by the endof October 2010 possible measures including more intensivesupervision and specific additional capital, liquidity, andother prudential requirements.14. We call on our international accounting bodies to redoubletheir efforts to achieve a single set of high quality, globalaccounting standards within the context of their independentstandard setting process, and complete their convergenceproject by June 2011. The International Accounting StandardsBoard's (IASB) institutional framework should further enhancethe involvement of various stakeholders.15. Our commitment to fight non-cooperative jurisdictions(NCJs) has produced impressive results. We are committed tomaintain the momentum in dealing with tax havens, moneylaundering, proceeds of corruption, terrorist financing, andprudential standards. We welcome the expansion of the GlobalForum on Transparency and Exchange of Information, includingthe participation of developing countries, and welcome theagreement to deliver an effective program of peer review. Themain focus of the Forum's work will be to improve taxtransparency and exchange of information so that countries canfully enforce their tax laws to protect their tax base. Westand ready to use countermeasures against tax havens fromMarch 2010. We welcome the progress made by the FinancialAction Task Force (FATF) in the fight against money launderingand terrorist financing and call upon the FATF to issue apublic list of high risk jurisdictions by February 2010. Wecall on the FSB to report progress to address NCJs with regardsto international cooperation and information exchange inNovember 2009 and to initiate a peer review process by February2010.16. We task the IMF to prepare a report for our next meetingwith regard to the range of options countries have adopted orare considering as to how the financial sector could make afair and substantial contribution toward paying for any burdensassociated with government interventions to repair the bankingsystem.             ]]></raw>
