Sasol, the world's top maker of motor fuel from coal, saidin a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission onFriday that it was concerned Washington's Iranian TransactionsRegulations posed a risk to its operations, the paper said. "There are possible risks posed by the potential impositionof U.S. economic sanctions in connection with activities we areundertaking in the polymers field, as well as feasibilitystudies relating to a potential ammonia-urea project atAssaluyeh in Iran," the paper quoted the company as saying. The regulations are part of the pressure being put on Tehranover its nuclear programme, which Washington suspects hasmilitary aims although Iran says its purpose is to produceelectricity.
