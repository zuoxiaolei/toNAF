<raw><![CDATA[ * China has vowed to keep buying Spanish government bonds * China will also participate in restructuring Spanish banks * Spain wants China to look at infrastructure investments (Adds quotes, details)	 BEIJING, April 13 (Reuters) - China's promises to buySpanish government bonds and invest in the restructuring ofSpanish banks are valuable commitments that will shore up marketconfidence in the euro zone state, Spanish Prime Minister JoseLuis Rodriguez Zapatero said on Wednesday.	 Since the deepening of European debt woes last year, Chinahas repeatedly expressed optimism about the health of theSpanish economy and the wider euro zone, backing up its talkwith large-scale purchases of European government bonds.	 With Zapatero visiting Beijing, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabaotook the pledges a step further, saying that China wouldcontinue to buy sovereign bonds and also participate in a fundto restructure Spain's debt-riddled savings banks.	 "The two promises are very valuable. They will help promoteour stability, reform and market confidence, especially theSpanish economic recovery, so I express my gratitude to theChinese government," Zapatero told a news conference, accordingto the Chinese-language translation.	 A Spanish government source told Reuters on Tuesday that Wendid not mention specific investment amounts at the meeting withZapatero. China already held 12 percent of the Spanish sovereigndebt in foreign hands, the source said. [ID:nLDE73B1NI]	 While vowing to support Spain, Chinese officials have alsomade it clear that they remain concerned about fallout fromEurope's debt crisis.	 In comments published on Tuesday, Vice Finance Minister LiYong warned that the troubles could spread beyond the eurozone's periphery if underlying structural problems were notproperly addressed.	 Asked whether Chinese officials had voiced such concerns inbilateral meetings, Zapatero said he had delivered a reassuringmessage.	 "What we have said to Chinese officials and investors isthat you should have confidence in Spain and such confidence iscoming from the understanding of our economic fundamentals,fiscal capability, economic reform and our growth potential," hesaid.	 "Analysts think that with Portugal asking for a bailout fromthe EU, euro zone sovereign debt risks are almost coming to anend, and this has been widely believed," he added.	 Along with shoring up Chinese interest in Spanish bondissues, Zapatero's trip was also intended to help drum upbusiness for Spanish firms.	 Among the deals signed during the bilateral meetings werememorandums of understanding for Spanish wind turbine makerGamesa to supply Chinese firms with 300 turbines for atotal power capacity of 600 megawatts.	 Zapatero said he was also encouraging the Chinese to investin Spanish infrastructure, potentially including airports. Spainwants to sell up to 49 percent of the loss-making airport groupAENA, worth a total of around 30 billion euros, as part ofefforts to reduce a massive public deficit.	 "We hope that we can attract private sector investment todevelop and manage these airports," he said.
