<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar came off session highs against the yen on Wednesday after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the bank had taken all of the measures “necessary” and “possible” for now to achieve the 2% inflation target.During European afternoon trade, USD/JPY retreated from session highs of 99.58 to hit 99.31, still up 0.34%.The central bank governor said that the BoJ’s campaign to fuel inflation and spur growth was not targeting the yen and added that monetary policy won’t be altered because of currency moves.The comments came during a press conference in Tokyo, six days after the BoJ embarked on a radical monetary easing program, aimed at beating deflation in the world’s third-largest economy.The dollar edged higher against the euro, with EUR/USD dipping 0.03% to 1.3077.The euro had been indirectly supported since the BoJ embarked on its easing plan as expectations that investors would move into higher yielding assets from Japanese government bonds pushed bond yields lower across the euro zone.The dollar hit session highs against the pound, with GBP/USD slipping 0.09% to 1.5307.Sterling remained supported after data on Tuesday showing that U.K. factory output rebounded in February eased concerns over the risk of a triple-dip recession.The dollar pulled away from six-week lows against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF dipping 0.03% to 0.9322.The greenback was broadly lower against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD dipping 0.02% to trade at 1.0160, AUD/USD rising 0.27% to 1.0518 and NZD/USD up 0.13% to 0.8537.The growth linked dollars were bolstered after official data showed that China posted an unexpected trade surplus in March as imports rose sharply to outstrip exports.The data helped eased concerns over weakening domestic demand in the world’s second largest economy.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose 0.14% to 82.55.              ]]></raw>
