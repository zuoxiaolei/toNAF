<raw><![CDATA[* MSCI world equity index up 0.1 percent at 323.11 * China data, strong Wall Street underpin mood * Dollar, euro steady; bunds, Treasuries higher  By Natsuko Waki LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Friday asinvestors grew more confident about the prospect for economicrecovery following robust U.S. and Chinese data, whileTreasuries stabilised after a sell-off earlier in the week. Friday's data showed China's imports and exports were muchstronger than expected in November, providing robust numbersthat served as a reminder that Chinese demand was still growingapace, boosting high-yielding currencies. China's central bank raised lenders' required reserves by 50basis points but left interest rates on hold, which also allayedinvestors' concerns that aggressive policy tightening could slowChina's growth down too much. "In recent weeks people have been talking about thepossibility of a rate hike in China," said Niels Christensen,currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen. "Given they only announced a reserve requirement hike we areseeing a bit of a relief rally as it has given a small boost torisk appetite."The MSCI world equity index rose 0.15 percent while theFTSEurofirst 300 index gained the same amount. U.S. stockfutures rose around a third of a percent, pointing to a firmeropen on Wall Street later. On Thursday, the benchmark S&P 500 index hit a two-year highwith data showing first-time claims for jobless benefits fellmore than expected last week.  TREASURIES RECOVER U.S. Treasuries edged up thanks to a strong auction of30-year bonds that reflected investor appetite. Treasuries soldoff heavily earlier in the week on U.S President Barack Obama'splans to extend low tax rates. However, those plans hit someopposition ahead of a Senate vote next week. Rising U.S. Treasury yields this week and growing inflationconcerns in developing economies -- together with the prospectof tighter Chinese policy -- also encouraged investors to scaleback their already overstretched bets on emerging markets. Emerging stocks lost 0.1 percent, underperforming theirdeveloped market counterparts. "Data all suggest that further policy normalisation isneeded to keep China's economy on an even keel. So far, Chinahas made only modest moves in this direction," RBC said in anote to clients. "We expect to see more urgency from Beijing in the monthsahead as tackling inflation becomes a greater priority, withboth rate hikes and currency appreciation likely to beemployed." Ten-year Treasuries were up 8/32 in price to yield 3.185percent, off a six-month high of 3.330 percent reached onWednesday. The sale of $13 billion of reopened 30-year U.S. bonds wentthrough at a yield below the level trading on the open market,indicating investors bid aggressively for the debt, with strongdemand particularly from foreign buyers. The dollar fell 0.1 percent against a basket of majorcurrencies, while the euro was steady at $1.3235. U.S. crude oil rose 0.4 percent to $88.75 a barrel. The bundfutures were steady.
