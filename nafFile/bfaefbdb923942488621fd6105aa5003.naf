<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded higher against the Japanese yen during Thursday’s Asian session even after the Federal Reserve said it will continue its USD85 billion per month asset-buying program over the near-term. In Asian trading Thursday, USD/JPY rose 0.12% to 98.01. The pair was likely to find resistance at 98.53, the earlier high from Wednesday’s session, and support at 97.59, the earlier low."The committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes," the Fed said in a statement."The committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens," the Fed added. In U.S. economic news out Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the U.S. economy grew 1.7% in the second quarter. The first-quarter growth rate was revised down to 1.1% from 1.8%. The average for the last 12 months remained at 1.4%. The ADP private payroll survey showed non-government employers added 200,000 jobs last month. Analysts expected the addition of 180,000 new jobs. The Labor Department delivers the July non-farm payrolls report Friday. Chicago area PMI rose to 52.3 this month from 51.6 in June. Economists expected a July reading of 54. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. Some traders still see added stimulus from the Bank of Japan as necessary to derailing the recently strong yen. However, BoJ is seen as having few tools out its disposal with which to force the yen lower. Elsewhere, AUD/JPY inched down 0.01% to 87.96 while EUR/JPY rose 0.08% to 130.35.             ]]></raw>
