<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The euro trimmed gains against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, easing back from the daily high as investors awaited a key press conference by the European Central Bank president after the bank’s rate setting meeting later in the day.EUR/USD pulled away from 1.4646, the daily high to hit 1.4599 during European morning trade, still up 0.11% on the day.The pair was likely to find support at 1.4450, the low of June 3 and resistance at 1.4694, Wednesday’s high and a one-month high.The single currency softened after an economic advisor to German Chancellor Angel Merkel said earlier that it is only a matter of time before Greece’s debt is restructured.The ECB was not expected to increase its benchmark interest rate but bank president Jean-Claude Trichet was widely expected to signal that the bank would raise its minimum bid rate in July. The bank bumped up its key interest rate to 1.25% from 1% in April amid rising consumer prices.The euro was also slightly higher against the pound, with EUR/GBP easing up 0.04% to hit 0.8892.Also Thursday, the U.S. was to publish official data on its trade balance as well as a weekly government report on initial jobless claims.             ]]></raw>
