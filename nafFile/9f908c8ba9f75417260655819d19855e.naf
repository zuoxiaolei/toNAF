<raw><![CDATA[ (Repeats to include UPDATE 1 in headline) By Tom Pfeiffer RABAT, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The Moroccan government expectslittle change to the kingdom's current account deficit nextyear as demand for its goods and services recovers from theglobal economic downturn, the finance minister said on Monday. Morocco has been trying to grab a bigger slice of worldtrade with new ports and business parks, tax breaks forexporters and cut price land deals to tempt foreign firms toset up manufacturing bases on Europe's doorstep. Its plans took a jolt this year as recessions in Europe hitsome of the north African country's key exports such as autoparts, electronic components and textiles. Slumping worldprices hit its most lucrative export, phosphates. Exports were still down 34 percent in the first nine monthsof the year, worse than a 29 percent drop in the first quarter.Foreign direct investment, remittances from Moroccans workingabroad and tourism income also have declined. Yet imports also have tumbled as world oil prices fell --Morocco buys in almost all of its energy requirements. Thegovernment has forecast a current account deficit of 4 percentthis year, narrowing from 5.2 percent in 2008. "For 2009 we see a current account deficit of 4 percent,and we think it will be at the same level, or 4-4.5 percent, in2010," Economy and Finance Minister Salaheddine Mezouar toldReuters in an interview. Mezouar was upbeat on prospects for an export recovery nextyear because the country was busy diversifying into new areas. "New sectors like auto and aerospace parts are certainlygoing to pick up again. The growing diversity and maturity ofour products on offer gives Morocco a chance to stabilise anddiversify its exports," he said. European consumer spending had not declined to levels thatthreatened a serious economic imbalance, he said. "All this tends towards an improvement in demand addressedto Morocco compared to what we've seen in 2009," Mezouar saidafter presenting the 2010 draft budget to the press. He said Morocco intended to push ahead with reforms to easethe movement of capital, including an opening of capitalaccounts and a shift to a more flexible currency exchange rate,but not until an economic recovery was confirmed. The Moroccan dirham tracks a basket of world currenciesincluding the euro and the U.S. dollar. When the financial crisis began, some countries delayedplans for more flexible currency rules and other liberalisingmeasures on fears they could spark a flight of capital. "Next year needs first to confirm a recovery. Once therecovery is confirmed, we will re-start work on these reformsthat are so important for our country," said Mezouar.
