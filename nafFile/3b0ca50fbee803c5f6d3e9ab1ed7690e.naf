<raw><![CDATA[The euro's rally from an 8-month low against the U.S. dollar stalled at 1.3714 on Monday, following the release of worse-than-expected data on investor sentiment toward euro zone economies.  EUR/USD was hovering around 1.3665 during midday European trade, after retreating from 1.3714, the daily high. The pair was likely to find resistance around 1.3903, Thursday's high, and short term support at 1.3585, Friday's low.  The euro also halted a rebound against the yen, sliding back to 121.90 after climbing to a daily high of 122.76.  Earlier Monday, the Sentix research group said its investor sentiment index for February plummeted to minus 8.2 from January's minus 3.7. Analysts had expected a rise to minus 2.3.             ]]></raw>
