<raw><![CDATA[ * Australian swaps rise, some expect rate hike in Oct * Indian OIS curve shifts upwards as RBI warns By Umesh Desai HONG KONG, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Interest rate swaps inAustralia rose on Friday amid growing speculation amonginvestors that its central bank may raise interest rates asearly as October after a recent batch of strong economic data. Indian swaps also rose after the central bank highlightedthe risk of upward pressures on prices from prolongedexpansionary fiscal and monetary policies, with poor rainfallan additional threat on inflation. Dollar lending rates continued their downward journey asinterbank cost of borrowing fell in Europe and the UnitedStates amid signs the economic recovery was not triggering anyincrease in loan pressure on lenders. In Singapore, the cost of 3 month dollars edged down toanother record low of 0.37143 percent from the previous 0.37786percent. The rates are less than a tenth of the levels thatprevailed last October after the collapse of Lehman Brothers,which triggered a scramble for cash as banks became riskaverse. Australian bill and bond futures tumbled and rate swapsrose with some investors even expecting a rate increase inOctober with December interbank futures suggesting rates couldhit 3.5 percent by year-end. Aussie 1-year swaps quoted 2.5 bps higher at 4.165 percentand are now at a nine-month high. "The data from Australia has been pretty strong, suggestingthe economy has a fair bit of momentum," said JohnKyriakopoulos, currency strategist at National Australia Bank."Interest rate markets are now bringing forward the prospectsof a rate hike to as early as October and that is helping theAussie." Australia on Thursday reported a surprise jump in businessinvestment last quarter, highlighting upward risks to growth. The Reserve Bank of Australia meets early next week todecide on rates, and while markets expect it to keep ratesunchanged at a record low of 3 percent, investors are moving tofactor in a good chance of a rate move as early as October. "There is a risk that the RBA shifts to a modest tighteningbias at next Tuesday's September board meeting which could wellbe justified by a firm Q2 GDP print," said RBC Capital Marketsin a note. "We will wait for next week's key developments and data butwe are likely to pull forward some of our 150bp of hikes fromH1 2010 into Q4 2009." In India, the overnight indexed swaps (OIS) curve shiftedupwards, after The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in its annualreport for 2008/09, said poor monsoons posed a greater risk forinflation than to growth and that timing an exit from itsaccommodative policies was a challenge. The one year OIS at a mid-point of 4.48 percent, jumpedabout 5 bps on Friday. But analysts said there was unlikely to be a increase inthe official interest rates as credit offtake remained poor andany rise would undo the recent gains from an accomodativepolicy. "If the headline inflation goes up because of commodityprices or base effect going out, it will not be a sufficientdriver for the RBI to raise rates as the growth management willbe an equal priority," Mahendra Jajoo, head of fixed income andstructured products, Tata AMC which oversees about 200 billionrupees. But he added the RBI's exit policy may start with liquiditymoderation and end with rate hike. (Editing by Jan Dahinten)             ]]></raw>
