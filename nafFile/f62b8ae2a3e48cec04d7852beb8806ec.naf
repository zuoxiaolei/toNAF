<raw><![CDATA[ PARIS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozycalled on Monday for an open G20 discussion of monetary reformand regulation of commodity markets, saying food price risesrisked causing riots. Sarkozy, who was spelling out France's goals this year asholder of the rotating presidency of the Group of 20 economicpowers, said agricultural commodity prices had recently toppedthe peaks that sparked riots in 2008. "If we don't do anything we run the risk of food riots inthe poorest countries and a very unfavourable effect on globaleconomic growth," he said in an address at the Elysee Palace inParis. "The day there are food riots, what country at the G20 tablewill say this does not concern them? I don't see a single one." He also called again for an international financialtransaction tax to help meet goals of finding $100 billion ayear to fund development at a time when many countries who madethose promises are deep in debt.
