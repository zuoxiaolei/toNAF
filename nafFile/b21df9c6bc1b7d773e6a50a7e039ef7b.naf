<raw><![CDATA[ * Aussie jumps on surprise employment rise, later trims gain * Fall in Chinese shares weighs on Australian dollar * NZ dlr dips after Q2 jobless rate climbs more than expected * Sterling steady, hovers near 9-mth peak before BoE * Economists split on if BoE will boost asset buying scheme By Satomi Noguchi TOKYO, Aug 6 (Reuters) - The dollar held near a nine-monthlow against the pound on Thursday before a policy decision by theBank of England, while the Australian dollar rose back towards a10-month peak after a surprise rise in Australian employment. The euro was steady against the dollar ahead of an interestrate decision by the European Central Bank later in the day. The Australian dollar jumped after data showed that 32,200jobs were created in Australia in July, far better than forecastsfor a loss of 20,000 jobs, adding to the risk of an early rise ininterest rates. Some of the strength in the Aussie was tempered by a 1.9percent drop in Chinese shares, but the Australian dollar stillhovered near its highest level since late last September. "The market cannot find a factor which could break theuptrend in the Aussie," said Hideki Amikura, deputy generalmanager of the forex section at Nomura Trust Bank. "But that said, tomorrow's U.S. jobs report is expected toshow weak numbers which may be the potential catalyst to dampeneconomic recovery hopes, and reverse recent gains in assetsincluding stocks and yen crosses," Amikura said. Sterling held steady against the dollar compared to late U.S.trading on Wednesday at $1.6994, down from its highest in morethan nine months of $1.7044 hit on Wednesday. The euro was little changed at $1.4409, not far from a 2009high of $1.4448 hit on trading platform EBS on Wednesday, itshighest since mid-December. Economists are split on whether the BoE will inject moremoney into the economy by extending its asset purchases at theend of a two-day policy meeting at 1100 GMT, although recentlybrighter British data is seen reducing such chances. The ECB appears certain to keep its key interest rate at arecord low 1 percent as it waits to see the impact of efforts sofar to revive the economy and credit flows. The ECB policydecision is expected at 1145 GMT followed by a news conference byECB President Jean-Claude Trichet. The Australian dollar rose 0.3 percent to $0.8439, but hadslipped off an intraday high of $0.8462. It hit a 10-month highof $0.8471 earlier this week. Against the yen, the Australian dollar rose 0.6 percent to80.22 yen but was off the day's high of 80.53 yen. "Aussie/yen had jumped, but since Shanghai shares fell quitea bit from the open it pared some gains. The correlation betweenthe Aussie and Shanghai shares has been very high recently," saida trader for a major Japanese bank. In contrast, the New Zealand dollar fell after data showedthe country's jobless rate climbed more than expected to 6.0percent for the second quarter, a nine-year high, backing viewsits central bank will keep interest rates at a record low wellinto 2010. The New Zealand dollar dipped 0.3 percent to $0.6716, pullingaway from a 10-month high of $0.6764 hit the day before. The dollar edged up 0.2 percent against the yen to 95.11 yen.
