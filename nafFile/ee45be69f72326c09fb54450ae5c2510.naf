<raw><![CDATA[ * Sees growth this quarter * Says persistent C$ strength could force BoC hand * Sees risk private demand might be slower than expected * Bank of Canada still can do more if needed * Sees Canadian recovery more robust than elsewhere (Adds remarks on Canadian growth being more robust) By Louise Egan KINGSTON, Ontario, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Canada's recessionmost likely ended in the third quarter, the Bank of Canada saidon Tuesday, voicing cautious optimism but also warning aboutthe risks of a persistently strong Canadian dollar. "Two years after the onset of a global financial crisis andafter three quarters of severe recession in Canada, theeconomic outlook for this country, and much of the world, hasimproved," Deputy Governor Timothy Lane told economists. "Although the recovery is likely to be muted, and effectiveand resolute policy implementation will be required, we arelikely to experience positive growth this quarter, and agradual closing of the output gap by the middle of 2011." But Lane also noted that a good deal of the recovery so farhad come from official action, and he said there was a riskthat private demand would not emerge as fast as desired. "At what stage will private demand be robust enough to makethe recovery self-sustaining? Clearly, we haven't reached thatpoint yet," he said. A second important risk, he said, was "the possibility ofpersistent strength in the Canadian dollar." "Other things being equal, a persistently strong Canadiandollar would reduce real growth and delay the return ofinflation to target," he said.  He said some of the currency's rise had stemmed fromfactors like higher commodity prices that are leading to aCanadian recovery. Traditionally, the bank has said it wouldnot counter foreign exchange movements based on such factors. However, he also said it was a result of a more generalizedweakening of the U.S. dollar as global financial conditionsnormalize. The Canadian unit further weakened after Lane's remarkswere published, extending a slide against the U.S. currencythat partly reflected strong U.S. economic data that boostedthe greenback. "I suppose the market is looking at two things. One is nosuggestion that rate hikes are forthcoming sooner thanpreviously thought, and two, the trepidation the Bank of Canadais expressing over Canadian dollar strength," said EricLascelles, chief economics and rates strategist at TDSecurities. If the stronger dollar were to alter the path of projectedinflation, the central bank would need to take that intoaccount, he said, noting that it retained considerable monetarypolicy flexibility, including possible quantitative easing. Quantitative easing refers effectively to the printing ofmoney, the kind of unconventional instrument which could berequired since the bank cannot cut its target interest ratebelow its current floor of 1/4 percent. Lane noted that the bank's conditional commitment to keeprates at that level until mid-2010 had helped. He said Canada's recovery would be supported by factorswhich would make it "somewhat more robust" than elsewhere. First, recovery in hard-hit U.S. sectors like housing andcars will benefit Canadian exporters. Second, Canada'sfinancial system is functioning well. Third is the underlyingstrength of household, business and government balance sheets. (Writing by Randall Palmer; editing by Janet Guttsman andFrank McGurty)             ]]></raw>
