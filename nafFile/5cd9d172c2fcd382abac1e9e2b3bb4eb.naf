<raw><![CDATA[ * Naoshima: didn't know figures hadn't been announced * GDP release is first since new govt took power By Tetsushi Kajimoto TOKYO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Japan's prime minister called histrade chief careless on Monday for revealing GDP figures in aspeech to business executives ahead of their official release,a slip that raised doubts about government handling ofsensitive information. The third-quarter growth figures were much stronger thanexpected and caused Japanese bond prices to dip, although theylater recovered as analysts warned the outlook was less thanrosy. Trade Minister Masayuki Naoshima said he mentioned the GDPfigures in a speech to oil industry officials just after 8 a.m.(2300 GMT on Sunday) because of concerns about the economy anddid not know the data had not yet been announced. "I'm sorry. I honestly didn't know it was due to bereleased at 8:50 a.m. so I thought it would be OK to talk aboutit," Naoshima told reporters. Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama called the incidentregrettable and the chief cabinet secretary said he hadseverely reprimanded Naoshima over the phone. "I think Naoshima was careless," Hatoyama told reporters."Even though it was a matter of 30 minutes, the release time isimportant and needs to be maintained." The figures showed Japan's economy grew 1.2 percent in thethird quarter, its fastest pace in more than two years asgovernment stimulus steps lifted consumer spending and capitalspending bottomed out. It was the first GDP data released since Hatoyama's newgovernment took office in mid-September after an Augustelection that ousted the long-dominant Liberal Democratic Party(LDP). "They still haven't got out of the habit of being anopposition party," said Kyohei Morita, chief economist atBarclays Capital Japan, adding that Hatoyama's Democratic Partyneeded to learn more about communicating with financialmarkets. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirofumi Hirano said it was a majorproblem but downplayed suggestions the minister should resign.He acknowledged the incident could cast doubt on thegovernment's ability to handle sensitive information. Leaks of GDP data are not new in Japan. The previous government under the LDP became more carefulin handling GDP after a newspaper reported the figures ahead oftheir release a decade ago, forcing policymakers to confirmthem. Japanese media were covering the meeting, but a governmentofficial said it appeared the figures were not reported beforethe official release time. It was unclear if the incident would affect public supportfor Hatoyama, which slipped to 62 percent in a poll publishedby the Asahi newspaper on Monday, down from 65 percent a monthago.
