He also said he opposed intervention in the currency marketif rates moves were gradual. "I can't think other countries will conduct jointintervention even though the yen rises slightly," Fujii, 77, toldreporters in parliament. Japan's Yukio Hatoyama was voted in as prime minister byparliament's lower house on Wednesday, ushering in an untestedgovernment to deal with a struggling economy and the deep-seatedproblems of a fast-ageing population. Hatoyama's choice of the veteran lawmaker as finance ministerhas soothed some analysts' concerns that the government'sspending programmes will inflate an already huge public debt.
