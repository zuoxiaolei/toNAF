<raw><![CDATA[ * Chronic long-term unemployment hampers S.African growth * More exports to emerging markets seen as key * Labour reform likely to meet union opposition  By Ed Cropley, African Investment Correspondent JOHANNESBURG, July 21 (Reuters) - South Africa is taking anurgent look at its economy as it battles chronic joblessness andmediocre growth, focusing on new markets and productivity in itsquest to raise living standards. But reforming labour markets, one obvious way to help narrowthe gap with other emerging economies, will not be easy giventhe political clout of a union movement that was instrumental inbringing an end to white-minority rule in the 1990s. "You need a much more flexible labour force but the unionsare still very powerful," Mthuli Ncube, chief economist at theAfrican Development Bank, said. "How do you tell the unions, 'Don't ask for more wages,don't unionise?' They're such a big political and social force.I don't know how you deal with that." Similarly, boosting the export sector by weakening the rand,a proposal endorsed this week by the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD), risks stoking inflation andscaring off the foreign capital needed to pay for much-neededinfrastructure. It is a hard choice, but there is a growing realisation inthe upper echelons of the African National Congress (ANC) thatsomething has to be done. Since a spike in employment in the six years that followedthe end of apartheid in 1994, the number of jobs in Africa'sbiggest economy has plateaued, despite annual growth of around 5percent from 2002-2007. Now, after the first recession in 17 years, the official andnarrowly defined rate of unemployment stands at 25 percent, asource of much newspaper comment and ANC hand-wringing. It is, however, the least worrying set of jobs data. As a simple percentage of its 17 million-strong workforce,South Africa's unemployment is actually around 45 percent, andhas never been below 40 percent since 2000. Such stagnation points to its workforce being one of theworld's least productive, and a principle reason the economystruggles to grow faster than 4-5 percent a year -- speedy whencompared to Europe but anaemic alongside Asia or more dynamicAfrican 'frontier' markets such as Nigeria, Ghana or Uganda. Of rich and emerging economies in 2008, only Turkey faredworse in terms of labour usage, with one in two of itsworkforce idle, according to the OECD. Brazil and Russia, two 'BRIC' economies that South Africalikes to regard as its emerging market peers, have broadunemployment of only 25 percent, the Paris think-tank says.  MORE EXPORTS So what can be done to drag the millions of jobless SouthAfricans, most of them young, poorly educated and black, intowork and, ultimately, tackle crime and yawning inequality? The ANC is already pumping a whopping 20 percent of itsbudget into education, and large amounts into job training, toaddress a shortage of skills, but it also knows the economy mustprovide jobs for people once they do leave school. One solution is to refocus the economy on exports,especially in labour intensive sectors like clothes andelectronics, rather than the coal and gold shipments that havebeen South Africa's staples for decades. The ANC has also seen the sense of selling to the fastergrowing economies of Asia, South America and Africa, rather thanthe traditional markets of Europe and the United States thatwill see only weak growth in the next few years. "South Africa needs to look for alternative export markets,such as Africa, and other fast-growing emerging economies, whereour comparative advantage is good," Finance Minister PravinGordhan said in email answers to a Reuters request for detailson plans to overhaul the economy. To this end, Gordhan wrote of the need to reform "networkindustries", basically the underinvested and overstaffed statefirms running South Africa's ports and railways. But more trade with the likes of, say, China and India, theother two members of the BRIC quartet, means more competition,and in terms of labour costs South Africa fares poorly. The average monthly salary, including overtime and benefits,is 6,400 rand ($830), according to Statistics SA. By contrast, this year the official average monthly wage fora city worker in China has been 1,783 yuan ($263) and a menialentry-level factory worker could be on a third of that, albeitwith food and dormitory accommodation thrown in.  WEAKER RAND OR LOWER WAGES? Such comparisons throw the spotlight on arguments from SouthAfrica's unions to boost exports by weakening the rand ,whose value has been underpinned in the last year by foreignersbuying up local stocks and bonds. COSATU, the union federation that forms part of an officialANC-led government alliance, wants an end to the rand's freefloat in favour of a fixed rate of 10 to the dollar, compared toits current 7.6. Yet even at this level the improvement in raw labour costsagainst China would be marginal, and the central bank is wary ofthe inflation that would inevitably result. All of which points to the labour market as one of the fewavenues left open to reform, essentially by making it easier foremployers to hire and fire workers. Yet it is a brave president who takes on unions who stillwield huge social and political clout due to their prominence inthe struggle against apartheid, and during his first year inoffice Jacob Zuma has tended to favour consensus over conflict. Gordhan's answers to Reuters avoided the issue of labourreform, but in a major report this week the OECD made clear itsbelief that the ANC and unions' perfectly laudable desire for"decent work" was at the expense of wider job creation. Such comments, alongside an avalanche of research on SouthAfrica during and after its successful hosting of the World Cup,may yet provide the impetus for long-term and radical change. The alternative is a South Africa stuck on a "splutteringtrajectory" well below emerging market rivals, political analystAlec Russell wrote in the Financial Times last week. "South Africa's economy has been utterly outstripped by the'southern' giants of China, India and Brazil," he said.
