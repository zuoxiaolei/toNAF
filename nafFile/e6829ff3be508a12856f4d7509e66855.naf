<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro marginally higher after ECB assurances on Greekrescue * Worries about corrosive euro zone debt problems remain * Equities shored up by upbeat Fed comments on economy * European shares seen higher but Asian stocks littlechanged By Ron Popeski SINGAPORE, April 29 (Reuters) - The euro inched higher onThursday from a one-year low the previous day as seniorEuropean officials gave assurances that they were serious abouthelping Greece find a way out of its escalating debt crisis. European shares  also rose in early trade, buoyedlargely by gains on Wall Street after the U.S. Federal Reservegave an upbeat assessment of the world's largest economy. [.N] The Fed comments, and its decision to keep interest ratesnear record lows, also lent some support to shares in Asia,though most markets failed to gain traction as European Unionmembers squabbled over details of a Greek bailout. Analysts said the problems in Europe, including a cut byStandard & Poors to Spain's credit rating overnight,highlighted the strength of Asian economies, which have snappedback from the global financial crisis much more quickly thanthe West. "The mood surrounding the euro remains sour," said SatoshiOkagawa, head of forex and money trading group at SumitomoMitsui Bank in Singapore. The battered euro  edged up to $1.3237, a rise ofabout 0.1 percent from late New York trade and aboveWednesday's low of $1.3237 on EBS, as European officials rushedto provide assurances that funds would be forthcoming forGreece. European Central Bank Governing Council member Axel Webertold Germany's Bild newspaper that a Greek debt default wouldhave "incalculable" consequences on markets and othercountries. France's budget minister also expressed the resolve of eurozone countries to help Athens. The single currency was beaten down on Wednesday as Germanybaulked again at parts of the aid plan, but it recovered onreports that the bailout may be much bigger than anticipatedand could be spread over several years. Markets had feared that an earlier relief plan may only beenough to tide Greece over its first debt repayment hurdle onMay 19, when it faces a maturing 8.5 billion euro bond. Mosteconomists believe Greece is facing a long and painfulmulti-year crisis, one which could repeatedly test EU unity. Juergen Trittin, parliamentary leader for Germany's Greenparty, quoted IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn as saying thepackage for Greece would be worth 100-120 billion euros($133-160 billion) over three years. [ID:nLDE63R115] European Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn toldFinnish television Greece would need "tens of billions ofeuros" on top of the 45 billion pledged by the IMF and eurozone governments for this year. Strauss-Kahn declined tocomment, saying the rescue package had not been settled. STOCKS SUPPORTED BY FED ACTION While investors remain fixated by troubles of Greece,Portugal and Spain, equity markets drew support from Fedcomments that U.S. economic activity has continued tostrengthen, even as it repeated its pledge to keep interestrates low for an extended period.[nN27125552] Stronger U.S. growth could offset any decline in Europecaused by problems in weaker euro zone economies. Major U.S. stock indexes rose as much as 0.7 percent on theFed statement, and S&P 500 futures  were indicated higheron Thursday. Low borrowing costs have helped fuel a massive stock marketrally since early last year, though momentum has sputtered inrecent months as Greece's financial problems escalated. The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside of Japan was off 0.1 percent by 0630 GMT, while Japanesemarkets were closed for the start of the country's long GoldenWeek holiday. Asia is seen as having limited direct exposure to Europeandebt problems for now. But analysts at DBS say euro zoneuncertainties may keep investors from adding to their positionsin this year's hot emerging stock and bond markets inIndonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. Crude oil prices also steadied on hopes that U.S. demandwill improve this summer, with U.S. light crude futures easing but holding above $83 a barrel. Gold was quoted just above $1,165 an ounce after a surge atits previous session to its highest year in response toconcerns over European sovereign debt. The U.S. dollar eased 0.15 percent against a basket ofmajor global currencies . (Editing by Kim Coghill)             ]]></raw>
