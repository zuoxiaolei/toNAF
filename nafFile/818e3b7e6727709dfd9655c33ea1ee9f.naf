<raw><![CDATA[ BERLIN/FRANKFURT, Sept 27 (Reuters) - The German equitymarket is headed for a relief rally on Monday following thesurprisingly clear outcome of parliamentary elections thatpoint to a comfortable majority for a centre-right government. Fears proved unfounded that the vote could be decided via acomplicated electoral system that allocates additional seats --something that could have tainted the political legitimacy of acoalition between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives andthe liberal, business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP). The left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD) suffered anhistoric defeat, prompting the party's leadership to say theywould retreat into opposition. "We have clear political relationships, and (the winners)are exactly those parties that normally trigger positivereactions," said Klaus Stabel, head of research at Frankfurtbrokerage ICF. "We will probably get a small bonus. I didn't expect such aclear majority for the CDU-FDP and it will give the markets alift," he continued, adding that the euro would likely alsoprofit slightly in Monday's trading thanks to the decisiveoutcome. While the election result would not impact his forecastthat Germany's blue-chip DAX index  could rise some1,000 points by March to 6,600 thanks to traditionally strongequity-market months, Stabel said it would help bolster thetrend. German nuclear power plant operators, such as E.On and RWE , are generally expected to benefitmuch more from the vote's outcome, since parties on the left ofthe spectrum including the Greens and the SPD had pushed fornuclear plants to be taken off the grid starting in 2020. "The rally will be noticeable alone from utilities sincethey can now expect an extension in the operating time of thenuclear power plants. For E.On and co., it's wonderful," saidKornelius Purps of UniCredit. Renewable energy stocks, and in particular the highlysubsidised solar power companies like Q-Cells  andSolarworld  would likely suffer. Christian Schick, a member of Fortis Investment's globalasset allocation team, said the FDP's calls for tax cuts couldslightly widen spreads for Germany's sovereign debt since it isunlikely that material cuts in spending would follow. "If you look at the bond markets and current yields, thetopic of government debt has not really been played -- just thecontraction in economic growth and deflationary risks," hesaid. Overall, market participants warned againstover-interpreting the impact German elections would have oninvestment decisions. "It's known that political markets have the shortest legsin the world," said equity markets expert Heino Ruland ofRuland Research.             ]]></raw>
