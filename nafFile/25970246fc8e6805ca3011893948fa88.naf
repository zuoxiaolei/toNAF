But European shares are seen recouping Friday's losses,with the DJ Euro Stoxx futures rising 0.5 percent. The U.S. dollar and the yen fell after strengtheninginitially when investors unwound riskier trades. The euroremained under pressure, hurt by concerns about fiscal problemsbuffeting Greece, which has seen its budget deficit balloon andits credit ratings cut. Euro zone finance ministers had little patience left forGreece after it misled them about the size of its deficit andwould be ready to impose sanctions on Athens if needed, eurozone sources said. Sentiment in Asia remained cautious. "We are quite cautious still considering the environment weare in -- some companies are doing better but the reality is itis a tough environment," said Alex Boggis, fund manager atAberdeen Asset Management, which oversees about $240 billion. "The hard work is still to be done in terms of exportersnot really kicking in and Asia still being geared to exports.It takes a long time to convert exports into consumption."

Fears that Beijing is moving to curb credit growth to avoidinflation and economic overheating rattled shares in China andthe rest of Asia last week. Traders say a raft of Chinese data this week, ranging fromfourth-quarter gross domestic product to December retail salesand industrial production could give clues on whether domesticconsumption in China is helping offset persistent weakness inU.S. demand and if monetary policy tightening is around thecorner. "It will be important to see if China is beginning toexperience inflation and whether there will be any tightening,"said Andrew Sullivan, a sales trader with broker MainFirstSecurities in Hong Kong. "If there isn't then obviously it is happy days. If thereis -- it will put further strain on market valuations."
