<raw><![CDATA[Greenback climbs to new multi-year highs vs. loonie after U.S., Canadian GDP dataInvesting.com - The U.S. dollar rose over 1% to fresh six-year highs against its U.S. counterpart on Friday, even as data showed that the U.S. economy grew at a slower pace than expected in the last quarter, as downbeat Canadian growth data weighed on the nation's currency.USD/CAD hit 1.2750 during early U.S. trade, the pair's highest since March 2009; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2755, climbing 1.09%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.2506, Thursday's low and resistance at 1.3063.The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Friday that U.S. gross domestic product rose 2.6% in the last quarter of 2014, down from a previous estimate of 3.0% and from a growth rate of 5.0% in the three months to September.The greenback remained supported after the Federal Reserve indicated this week that interest rates could start to rise around mid-year.Meanwhile, a report by Statistics Canada showed that the country's GPD fell 0.2% in November, compared to expectations for a 0.1% downtick and after a 0.3% gain in October.The loonie was sharply lower against the euro, with EUR/CAD rallying 1.04% to 1.4431.Also Friday, Eurostat reported that the annual rate of euro zone inflation fell by 0.6% in January, after a 0.2% slip in December. Economists had expected an annual decline of 0.5%.Core inflation, which strips out volatile measures such as food and energy costs, rose 0.5% on a year-over-year basis, but was still well below the European Central Bank's target of close to, but just under 2%.In a separate report, Eurostat said the euro zoneâ€™s unemployment rate ticked down to 11.4% in December from 11.5% the previous month, confounding expectations for the rate to remain unchanged.Later in the day, the U.S. was to release reports on business activity in the Chicago region and revised data on consumer sentiment.             ]]></raw>
