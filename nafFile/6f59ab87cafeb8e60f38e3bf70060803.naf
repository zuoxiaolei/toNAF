<raw><![CDATA[ * World stocks firm, on track for best week so far in 2011 * Australian dollar hits 2-yr high vs greenback * Portugal 10-year yield at euro-era high * Oil, gold steady, watching Mideast, Libya (Recasts, updates prices; adds analyst quotes) By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, March 25 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Fridayand were on track to post their best week since November, whilethe euro slipped against the dollar on increasing concern aboutthe worsening debt crisis in Portugal. U.S. stocks advanced after an optimistic outlook bysoftware maker Oracle fueled hopes that a global resurgence intechnology spending remained intact. However, volume remainedweak. "Oracle shows IT spending continues to be strong," saidMichael Quigley, tech analyst at Wedgewood Partners in St.Louis. "The whole software chain seems to be doing well." U.S. equities are leading global stocks and setting up toclose their best week of the last 20, albeit on thin volume. "The market has bounced back a lot," said Andrew Wilkinson,senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group inGreenwich, Connecticut. "We're pulling into the weekend with areal rebound in risk appetite." The MSCI All-Country index  gained 0.4 percentand was on track to post its best week since early November. Volume has dwindled in U.S. and other markets, includingEurope, as violence in the Middle East and northern Africa,coupled with Japan's natural disasters two weeks ago and itsongoing nuclear crisis, cloud the outlook for the globaleconomic recovery. The Dow Jones industrial average  was up 84.46points, or 0.69 percent, at 12,255.02. The Standard & Poor's500 Index  was up 9.11 points, or 0.70 percent, at1,318.77. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 25.40points, or 0.93 percent, at 2,761.82. Portugal's president consulted political leaders on Fridayon whether to call a snap election after the Socialist primeminister resigned following parliament's rejection of hisreforms. The crisis could force Lisbon to request a bailoutfrom the European Union and International Monetary Fund. Formore, see: [ID:nLDE72N0NZ]. Portuguese bond yields hit new highs after Standard &Poor's downgraded the country's debt ratings and warned itcould cut them again. "For most of the week the market has treated Portugal as anisolated problem that will not spread to other parts of Europebut this sentiment is losing popularity very quickly," saidKathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New York.She added that the downgrade prompted "the first majorrejection of Portuguese assets." Still, Spain's Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapaterosaid he did not fear contagion from a potentially prolongedperiod of political instability in Portugal. [ID:nLDE72O1EF] Spain is considered by the markets as a likely candidate tobe the fourth euro zone country to seek a bailout followingGreece, Ireland and possibly Portugal. The yield on 10-year Portuguese government bonds rose to aeuro-era high above 8 percent, well above the level thegovernment says is sustainable. European shares rose on stronger signs on the economy andcorporate results, but gains  were tempered by the euro zonedebt problems. The euro  was last down 0.2 percent at $1.4128,having earlier hit a session low of $1.41133 on tradingplatform EBS. The dollar index , a gauge of the greenback against abasket of major currencies, rose 0.3 percent, supported byrevised U.S. GDP data. The yen traded above 81 per dollar , a level it hasclung tightly to all week since a rare coordinated interventionby leading central banks last Friday to curb its appreciation. Higher-yielding currencies gained as the global economicoutlook boosted risk appetite and on growing demand fordollar-funded carry trades. The Australian dollar hit a fresh 29-year peak against theU.S. currency as traders said gains triggered a series ofautomatic buy orders.

Investors were keeping a close eye on protests in Yemen,Bahrain and Syria. "So long as ongoing problems in the Middle East continue toelevate risks of a further supply disruption, there is a stronglikelihood of a price spike in the second quarter," said J.P.Morgan analysts headed by Lawrence Eagles. Spot gold held steady below the previous session's recordhighs, as worries over euro zone's debt crisis and Middle Eastturmoil supported sentiment.
