<raw><![CDATA[ WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - Republican senators urgedPresident Barack Obama on Tuesday to lay out a "specifictimeline" for winning approval of long-delayed free tradeagreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. "The immediate consideration of these FTAs has never beenso important," Senator Orrin Hatch and 15 of his colleaguessaid in a letter touting the "significant" job gains that couldcome from the pacts. The deals have been on Obama's desk since he took office inJanuary 2008 and he appears unlikely to send them to Congressbefore the November mid-term elections. They were negotiated during the tenure of his predecessor,George W. Bush, who was unable to persuade the Democratic-runCongress to ratify the pacts. Obama has said he wants to fix problems with the deals, buthas resisted setting any deadlines for action. "We respectfully request that your administration provide,on an expedited basis, to Korea, Colombia and Panama awell-defined and finite list of those particular outstandingissues to be accomplished and provide Congress with a proposedspecific timeline for the enactment of these FTAs once thosearticulated matters are resolved," the senators said. They argued quick action is needed because the UnitedStates risks losing exports to competitors such as the EuropeanUnion and Canada, which have struck their own trade deals withone or more of the three countries. Many Democrats oppose the agreements, making it unlikelyObama could win their approval without a major and divisivefight within his own party. The Obama administration says it wants South Korea to makechanges to its agreement that would open the Korean market tomore American cars. It has called on Colombia to do more to stop violenceagainst trade unionists and to prosecute those responsible. It has pressed Panama to reform its bank secrecy laws andstrengthen its labor regime.(Reporting by Doug Palmer; Editing by Sandra Maler)             ]]></raw>
