<raw><![CDATA[ * Credit rating agencies concerned by deadly Thai clashes * Thai c.bank worried prolonged turmoil could hurt ratings * Further deterioration in stability would harm govtfinances * Share prices fall, credit default costs climb (Adds S&P comments, combines earlier stories) HONG KONG, April 12 (Reuters) - Violent protests in Bangkokwhich killed 21 people at the weekend could fuel furtherpolitical instability in Thailand and does not augur well forits credit rating, a Standard & Poor's (S&P) analyst said onMonday. Rival Fitch Ratings and Thailand's central bank governoralso expressed concerns that the country's sovereign creditrating could be at risk from the growing political turmoil.[ID:nSGE63B05Z] [ID:nBKT003246] Thousands of anti-government protesters are still on thestreets of Bangkok and in a defiant mood after the army failedto move them on Saturday from an area where they have campedout for a month. The clashes between security forces and protesters, theworst political violence in the country since 1992, drove Thaistocks  down 5 percent to a four-week low on Mondaywhile the cost of insuring Thai debt jumped. "The current negative outlook captures the underlyingpolitical tensions, although the latest clashes in Bangkoksuggest there could be further deterioration in politicalstability," said Kim Eng Tan, sovereign analyst at S&P. "The latest developments do not appear to argue forrestoration of a stable outlook," he told Reuters. Last April, S&P lowered Thailand's domestic currency ratingto A-minus from A and kept its outlook on negative. The agencyalso has a negative outlook on Thailand's BBB-plus foreigncurrency rating. Tan said the street protests of the recent past were oftendiffused by a change in government, but this time thegovernment appeared likely to retain power in the near term,resisting protesters' demands to step down. Thailand's government is expecting to post a budget deficitof 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year, more thandouble that of Indonesia, after posting a deficit of over 5percent of GDP in its fiscal year to October 2009. A sharp drop in tourism revenues as a result of theclashes, or a sudden exodus of foreign investors would add tothe fiscal pressures facing the government even as the economytries to shake off the lingering impact of the global financialcrisis. Thailand, along with other Southeast Asian economies, hasseen foreign capital surge into its markets in recent months onthe region's strong economic growth prospects. Fitch said it was "particularly concerned" about Thailand'slocal currency rating. "We expect a deterioration in public finances of Thailand,given the escalated political uncertainty ...," Vincent Ho,associate director of Fitch's Asia Sovereign ratings, toldReuters. Fitch rates Thailand's foreign currency debt as "BBB" witha stable outlook while the local currency is rated "A-minus"with a stable outlook. Ho said it was too early to say if Fitch would change isoutlook or ratings on Thailand as the current politicalsituation was "fluid", but he doubted a snap election would endthe political deadlock. Financial markets have turned jittery after weeks oflargely peaceful protests turned violent. Thailand's five-year credit default swaps (CDS), which reflect the cost of insuring its debtfrom default or severe deterioration, moved out to trade at itswidest in 7 weeks. Asked if Thai ratings faced the possibility of beingdowngraded, Bank of Thailand Governor Tarisa Watanagase toldreporters: "Yes, there is a risk and if that happens, it willaffect borrowing costs in the private sector." --------------------------------------------------------- For a graphic showing Thai CDS underperformance click on: http://r.reuters.com/gab47j --------------------------------------------------------- "So far we have not seen a serious decline in foreigndirect investments but increasingly people will be worriedabout political tensions spilling over into areas of affectingtheir long term investments," said S&P's Tan. Foreign investors were net sellers of 1.76 billion baht($54.6 million) of stock on Friday, their second straight dayof net selling, reducing their purchases since Feb. 22 to 55.73billion baht ($1.73 billion). Foreigners had bought $1.8 billion in Thai stocks from Feb.22 until Thursday. The recent foreign buying of Thai stocks wasspurred by cheap valuations and a recovery in the economy.
