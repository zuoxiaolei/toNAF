<raw><![CDATA[ * Talk of Japanese investor and exporter buying of yen * More Japanese exporter dlr offers seen at Y86.50-Y89.00 * Canadian dlr hold gains made on huge corporate takeover bid By Masayuki Kitano TOKYO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The yen rose on Wednesday, withtraders citing yen-buying by Japanese players, while the Canadiandollar held gains made on news of a huge takeover bid by globalminer BHP Billiton for Canada's Potash Corp. The yen dipped against the dollar and the euro in early Asiantrading, staying on the defensive after retreating the previousday as U.S. and European shares rose and U.S. Treasury yieldsedged higher. But the yen later received a boost, with market playersciting yen buying by Japanese investors and exporters in yencrosses and the dollar. The dollar shed 0.1 percent against the yen to 85.39 yen,slipping back toward a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on EBS lastweek. "The trend of dollar-selling looks unchanged," said a traderfor a Japanese foreign exchange broker. "The yen has been sold a bit but there was no major slide,suggesting this was just a bit of a pullback move," the tradersaid, referring to the yen's decline the previous day. The euro fell 0.5 percent to 109.64 yen, giving back much ofthe previous day's 0.6 percent gain and slipping back towards itslowest in nearly seven weeks of 109.07 yen hit on tradingplatform EBS earlier this week. Against the dollar, the euro dipped 0.4 percent to $1.2838. The dollar's moves against the yen have recently had a highcorrelation with U.S.-Japanese government bond yield spreads,which have narrowed as U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply in thepast few months. In addition to the talk of yen buying by Japanese exporterson Wednesday, a manager at a major Japanese bank said Japaneseexporters were placing dollar offers from around 86.50 yen to89.00 yen, having lowered their target levels for selling thedollar from around 90 yen previously. The dollar edged up 0.1 percent against the Canadian dollarto C$1.0339, trimming a bit of its losses after sheddingmore than 1 percent against the Canadian dollar on Tuesday. The Canadian dollar surged on Tuesday after BHP Billitonlaunched an unsolicited $38.6 billion bid for Canada's PotashCorp. JAPAN'S STANCE ON YEN Investors are watching whether the Bank of Japan or thegovernment will take new steps to rein in the yen'sexport-sapping rise ahead of a meeting between Prime MinisterNaoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa expectednext Monday. Japanese authorities seem unlikely to conduct yen-sellingintervention unless the yen's rise accelerates, market playerssay. The more likely response by Japanese authorities would besome form of monetary easing by the BOJ such as expanding theamount or maturity of its three-month fixed-rate fund supplyingoperation, which the central bank decided to adopt last Decemberafter the dollar's drop below 85 yen in late November. An options trader for a major Japanese bank said there wasscepticism among Japanese traders about whether any BOJ easingmeasures would have much impact on the yen with Japanese interestrates already so low, and there were also doubts about whetherthe central bank would unveil any easing steps in the near term. While market speculation about possible steps by the BOJ maylend support to the dollar against the yen for now, the dollarmay eventually extend its decline if the market is disappointedby any BOJ measures or it takes no action, the trader said. "In the end there could be disappointment, in which case thedollar may fall towards 83 yen," he said. (Additional reporting by Kaori Kaneko; Editing by MichaelWatson)             ]]></raw>
