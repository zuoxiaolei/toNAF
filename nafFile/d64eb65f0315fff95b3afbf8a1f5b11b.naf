<raw><![CDATA[ BEIJING, Dec 23 (Reuters) - China on Wednesday slappedanti-dumping duties on imports of carbon steel fasteners from theEuropean Union, just a day after the EU extended import duties onshoes from China and Vietnam. A review found that Chinese producers of certain types offasteners such as screws and washers had been materially injuredby dumping by EU firms, the Ministry of Commerce said in astatement on its website. It will enforce the anti-dumping duties, ranging from 16.8percent to 24.6 percent, starting Dec. 28. China has been involved in a tussle with the EU overfasteners this year, just one of a series of trade complaintslodged against Beijing by its trading partners. The EU imposed its own anti-dumping duties on Chinese importsof some screws and bolts in January, a decision that China laterchallenged at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). While China has seen more cases taken against it, it has alsogrown more ready to bring cases of its own, something manyanalysts say is a healthy sign that it is becoming a more activemember of the WTO. In the latest instance of trade tensions, EU ministers votedon Tuesday to extend import duties on shoes from China andVietnam by 15 months, despite a vote on Nov. 19 by the EU'santi-dumping committee to reject plans to extend the tariffs. [ID:nLDE5BL0R0] China said it was unhappy with the decision and would takeaction via the WTO. "China is extremely dissatisfied," Yao Jian, a spokesman forChina's Commerce Ministry, said in a statement on the ministry'swebsite (www.mofcom.gov.cn) late on Tuesday.
