<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar falls as stocks, commodities rally * Investors square positions ahead of U.S. data * U.S. jobs data key focus; ISM stronger than expected (Updates prices, adds quote, changes byline) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell on Mondayas broad gains in stock and commodity prices encouragedinvestors to seek riskier, higher-yielding investments at theexpense of the greenback. The dollar dropped also as traders locked in gains on itsrally over the past month ahead of key U.S. jobs data on Fridaywhich could dictate the currency's near term direction. For much of 2008, the prospects of prolonged, low U.S.interest rates have spurred investors to buy high-yield assetsfunded by cheap borrowing in the dollar. While that pattern wasinterrupted before the year-end, analysts say the negativedollar-risk relationship is likely to reemerge. "Risk was clearly back on for the first day of trading inthe new year," said Michael Woolfolk, senior currencystrategist at BNY Mellon in New York. "With risk back on, thenegative correlation between the Dow and the U.S. dollar hasalso returned." In afternoon trading, the euro  was up 0.7 percentagainst the dollar at $1.4423. The single currency recovered from earlier falls, whichtook it as low as $1.4258, testing a key chart support levelaround $1.4229 where the 200-day moving average sits, and insight of December's low around $1.4218. A euro zone purchasing managers' survey, which confirmedthe region's manufacturing sector expanded at its fastest ratein 21 months in December [ID:nLDE6030JH], also helped the euroagainst the dollar. The ICE Futures' dollar index , a gauge of thegreenback's performance against six other major currencies,fell 0.5 percent to 77.443. Against the yen, the dollar traded down 0.5 percent at92.50 yen , giving up gains which lifted it to afour-month high of 93.21 yen. Traders said resistance was seenahead of its 200-day moving average around 93.60 yen. Optimism about the prospects for a U.S. recovery hassupported the dollar in December but analysts said moreevidence of a strengthening economy was needed to justifyfurther gains. The dollar has moved mostly higher since figures early lastmonth showed the U.S. economy shed a far fewer-than-expected11,000 jobs in November. For December payrolls, the median forecast of analystspolled by Reuters is for a decline of 8,000. However, thepredictions ranged widely, from a loss of 80,000 jobs to anincrease of 59,000. [ECI/US] Some economists think December marked the first month intwo years that there were more jobs created than eliminated.Any sign of jobs growth raises expectations the U.S. FederalReserve will hike interest rates sooner rather than later -- amove that would boost dollar-based assets. "The implications of positive job growth, regardless ofwhether it is a few hundred or a few thousand jobs, should helpto drive the dollar higher," said Kathy Lien, director ofcurrency research at GFT in New York. A report from the Institute for Supply Management showingthe U.S. manufacturing sector expanded in December for a fifthstraight month briefly helped the dollar trim its lossesagainst the euro.
