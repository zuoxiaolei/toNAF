<raw><![CDATA[Pound pulls away from session highs vs. dollar on BoE minutesInvesting.com - The pound trimmed gains against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, after the minutes of the Bank of England's latest policy meeting revealed a unanimous vote in favor of maintaining its monetary policy.GBP/USD pulled back from 1.5646, the pair's highest since July 17, to hit 1.5609 during European morning trade, still up 0.33%.Cable was likely to find support at 1.5527, Tuesday's low and resistance at 1.5671, the high of July 17.The minutes of the BoE's July meeting showed all nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee were in favor of leaving the key interest rate at a record low of 0.5% and making no changes to the central bank's £375 billion asset-purchase program.According to the minutes, a number of policymakers see rising inflation risks.BoE Governor Mark Carney said last week that the decision to raise interest rates from record lows will come into sharper focus around the end of 2015, his strongest hint yet about the timing of the British central bank's next move.Most market players expect the BOE to begin slowly raising interest rates in mid-2016.Sterling was also higher against the euro, with EUR/GBP sliding 0.32% to 0.7007.The single currency weakened as the Greek parliament was set to vote later Wednesday on a second set of reforms needed to secure the country's bailout deal.If lawmakers approve the financial and judicial reforms, Greece will be able to press ahead with negotiations for an €86 billion bailout from its creditors.On Monday, Greek banks reopened following a forced 3-week closure, while restrictions on cash withdrawals remained in place.In addition, the International Monetary Fund confirmed that Greece had cleared its overdue debt repayments of €2.05 billion and was no longer in arrears.The repayments, and another for €4.2 billion to the European Central Bank due on Monday, were made possible by a short-term European Union loan of €7 billion.Greece's next major deadline is August 20, when it must pay €3.2 billion owed to the ECB, followed by a payment of €1.5 billion to the IMF in September.             ]]></raw>
