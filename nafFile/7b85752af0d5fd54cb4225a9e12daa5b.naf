The yen stumbled across the board, undercut by expectationsof investment trust flows out of Japan this week and as gains inthe euro set off automatic sell orders in other yen pairs. European shares rose 0.4 percent in early trade, heading fora ninth straight daily rise, but analysts said significant gainsin currencies including the euro and sterling may be limited bylingering concerns about the weakness of the global economy. "Recent earnings data are helping risk appetite, butnevertheless, the upsides of risky currencies are capped as themarket realises that improvements in the global economy will beslow," said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency strategist atCommerzbank in Frankfurt. "Speculators don't really have lots of room to move ineither direction," he said, adding that many in the market werewary of taking on big positions as market liquidity thins duringthe summer holiday season. He said that may keep currenciesrangebound in the near-term. At 0747 GMT, the euro inched up 0.3 percent to $1.4242,climbing near $1.4278 touched earlier in the week, its highestsince early June. Gains in the euro helped to keep the dollar index underdownward pressure. It was little changed at 78.729, but hoverednear a seven-week low of 78.563 hit the previous day.  HIGH-RISK CURRENCIES GAIN Sterling and the Australian and New Zealand dollars --currencies often seen as being higher risk -- each rose around0.4 percent against the dollar, while gaining more than 1percent against a broadly weaker yen. The dollar rose 0.7 percent to 94.28 yen, as traders dumpedthe Japanese currency before launches this week of "toshin"Japanese investment trusts which will invest in overseas assetsand foreign currencies. Market participants are speculating that these products mayattract solid demand, and that pushed the yen lower. With few major economic events or data scheduled in Europeon Thursday, investors will look to second-quarter earnings fromU.S. and European firms, including American Express, as well asdata on U.S. jobless claims and existing home sales. Risk appetite has been improving in recent days, fuelled bystrong quarterly results from some large banks including GoldmanSachs, although results from Morgan Stanley on Wednesday weredisappointing. Traders said Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke providedlittle market-moving news on Wednesday in testimony to theSenate Banking Committee. Bernanke reiterated that the U.S.economic outlook was improving but supportive policies would benecessary for a while to prevent rising joblessness from sappingeconomic recovery.
