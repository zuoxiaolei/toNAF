<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro hovers below resistance at $1.4283 Nov peak * Aussie dips on profit-taking * RBA keeps interest rates unchaned as expected By Natsuko Waki	 TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - The euro hovered below afive-month high against the dollar on Tuesday as investorsassessed whether it can make fresh gains given that marketplayers have already positioned themselves for a series ofinterest rate hikes in the euro zone during 2011.	 The European Central Bank is expected to raise rates by aquarter point from a record low of 1 percent at a meeting onThursday to rein in inflationary pressures, with two more 25basis point hikes priced in by year-end .	 But the single currency has already risen more than 6percent against the dollar and more than 10 percent versus theyen this year, making investors reluctant to buy more ahead ofthe meeting this week.	 The euro's rally has stalled right below resistance at itsNovember high of $1.4283. That level is also crucial as itroughly coincides with trendline resistance drawn from theeuro's record high set in July 2008.  	 "For the ECB, an April interest rate hike is a done deal andone or two more hikes are priced in. It's hard to see a positivesurprise from here," said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategistat Barclays Bank.	 "Still, the euro zone would be the first to raise interestrates, which supports the euro. Expectations for diversificationflows from higher oil prices are also positive. There is also arisk that the Fed minutes may show a hawkish tone."	 The euro fell 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade on Monday to$1.4203 , pulling away from a five-month high of $1.4269	hit on Monday on trading platform EBS.	 A rise above its November peak of $1.4283 could open the wayto $1.4374, the 76.4 percent retracement of the euro's slidefrom November 2009 to June 2010. Support is seen at $1.4190,with traders citing stops through to below $1.4150.     	 The euro edged up 0.2 percent against the yen to 119.77 yen , close to its 11-month peak of 120.073 yen hit onMonday.	 The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 84.33 yen , edgingcloser to a six-month peak of 84.735 yen set on Friday. A200-day moving average at around 83.55 is now seen acting assupport.	  FOCUS ON CENTRAL BANKS	 The Australian dollar dipped 0.4 percent to $1.0323 , pressured by profit-taking in the wake of its rise toa 29-year high of $1.0422 the previous day. There was talk ofboth bids and stop-loss offers around $1.0300.	 The Aussie dollar took in its stride the Reserve Bank ofAustralia's decision to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.75percent as widely expected. [ID:nL3E7F40J2]	 Some market players said, however, that position unwindingcould temper gains in the Aussie from here on.	 "In the medium term, the Aussie remains supported, but thereis some room for position reduction. Rather than looking for arun-up in Aussie/U.S. dollar, you would look at Aussie/yen andperhaps Aussie/Swiss franc," said Robert Ryan, senior G10currency strategist for BNP Paribas in Singapore.    	 Later on Tuesday, focus will turn to the Fed minutes formore hints on the Fed's policy outlook.    	 Underscoring the market's focus on Fed speakers, the dollaredged higher against the yen and the euro earlier on Tuesday,following comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman BenBernanke.	 Currency traders, however, said that the move in the dollarlikely was due to the market having been short the dollar ratherthan anything else.	 Bernanke said a recent pick-up in U.S. inflation was drivenprimarily by rising commodity prices globally, but added thatwas unlikely to persist. [ID:nN04294041]	 After a string of hawkish comments from Fed officials, some U.S. central bankers have struck a more cautious tone.    	 On Monday, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said U.S.inflation was likely to remain moderate and St.Louis Fed Research Director Christopher Waller said the Fed waslikely to buy all the bonds it has said it would purchase byJune 30. [ID:nN04277975] 	 Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Federal ReserveBank, told CNBC on Monday the Fed's programme is most likely an"adequate" size. [ID:nWEN0460]  	 "It is becoming increasingly evident (there is) a divergencein opinions among Fed members. These different opinions amongFed members may seep into the FOMC minutes later today," BNPParibas said in a note to clients.	 "This may be interpreted as hawkish, but we expect the Fedto stand pat especially since we expect incoming data through Q2to be on the weaker side."
