<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – Last week the euro fell from a 12-week high against the U.S. dollar after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet quashed hopes for a near-term interest rate hike after he said inflation risks were balanced.EUR/USD hit 1.386 on Wednesday, the pair’s highest since November 9; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3582 by close of trade on Friday, down 0.02% on the week.The pair is likely to find support at 1.3448, the low of January 21 and resistance at 1.3824, Thursday’s high.The euro lost support after Trichet said that "very close monitoring" of price developments was "warranted” but added that inflation expectations remained “firmly anchored,” after the ECB held its minimum bid rate at 1.00%, unchanged for the 21st successive month.Trichet said higher prices were prompted “mainly” by rising energy and commodity costs and that this “has not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon.”Meanwhile, the dollar strengthened after data on Thursday showed that the U.S. services sector grew in January at its fastest pace since August 2005 while the number of people claiming initial jobless benefits fell more-than-expected.The dollar extended the previous day’s gains after the U.S. Department of Labor said Friday that 36,000 jobs were added in January, far less than the 150,000 forecast and the smallest gain in four months but the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell from 9.4% to 9%, the lowest level in two years.Next week, the U.S. is to publish key weekly data on initial jobless claims while the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the head of the ECB are both to speak.Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.Monday, February 7In the euro zone, Germany is to release official data on factory orders, a leading indicator of production.
