<raw><![CDATA[ * Says domestic demand, commodity price surge boostingimports * Firmer yuan put some strains on Chinese export orders (Adds details, background)	 BEIJING, April 22 (Reuters) - China's imports are likely togrow at a faster clip than exports in 2011, leading to furtherimprovements in the country's trade balance, the Ministry ofCommerce said on Friday.	 The projection of stronger imports follows from thegovernment's supportive policies and rising global commoditiesprices, the ministry said in a report on trade outlook on itswebsite (www.mofcom.gov.cn).	  "Import growth is likely to continue to outstrip exportgrowth due to a combination of factors -- stronger domesticdemand, policies on expanding imports and rising globalcommodity prices," the ministry said.	 "Export orders are increasing in line with the sustainedrecovery of the world economy and improvements in the externalmarket, but the picture for exports looks complex," the reportsaid.	 Some of the improvement in the overall balance will comeabout simply from the depreciation of the U.S. dollar in globalmarkets, which makes the imported value of dollar-denominatedcommodities greater. The flip side of that is the difficultyfaced by Chinese exporters from a rising yuan that makes Chinesegoods less competitive globally.	 Chinese exporters, particularly smaller exporters, are alsostruggling to cope with rising raw materials and labour costs.	 The central bank's repeated rises in interest rates and bankreserve requirements have increased funding costs and led to astrain on capital for some exporters, the commerce ministrysaid.	 "In addition, the renminbi (yuan) is facing relatively bigpressures to appreciate, which have affected company orders tosome extent," it added.	 The ministry did not give exact forecasts on exports andimports for 2011.	 China's trade surplus is on track to narrow for the thirdstraight year from last year's $183 billion.	  China recorded a $1.02 billion trade deficit in the firstquarter -- its first quarterly trade deficit since 2004 -- dueto domestic economic strength and rising global commodityprices.	 China, under pressure from the United States and others tolet its yuan currency rise more quickly as a way to cut its bigtrade surplus, is trying to imbalance its economy towarddomestic consumption, cutting reliance on exports and giving theworld a lift through surging demand for imports.
