<raw><![CDATA[ * Dlr/yen loses height after jump on intervention nerves * Traders cite talk of miss-hit or technical glitch * Fall in U.S. yields pressures dollar ahead of FOMC * China data, Asian currencies' rise help euro, Aussie By Hideyuki Sano and Charlotte Cooper TOKYO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket ofcurrencies on Monday and, after a brief spike against the yen onintervention speculation, quickly lost height there as well astalk circulated the jump had been caused by a miss-hit ortechnical glitch. The greenback came under pressure against most other majorcurrencies, with the euro testing resistance at $1.4000, as themarket gears up for the Federal Reserve to step up money printingafter its policy meeting on Nov. 2-3. After spiking more than 1 yen to 81.60 yen in early Asiantrade, the dollar gave up its gains and slid back within range ofits 1995 record low of 79.75 yen, with talk of dollar salesrelated to redemptions of U.S. Treasuries weighing it down. Analysts say the market remains fairly short dollars as itheads into the Fed meeting but short-term players who havelightened positions recently have room for moving intra-day. "The market doesn't want to take a big position but ifthere's a move, for example on some certain information about QE,then the market may follow," said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FXstrategist Japan at Barclays Capital.  The dollar was flat at 80.38 yen after leaping from 80.35yen to 81.60 yen very rapidly at about 0000 GMT. Dealers said the spike came as the dollar/yen price jumpedstraight from about 80.40 yen to 80.70 yen on trading platformEBS, making many suspect possible intervention by Japaneseauthorities, who intervened for the first time in more than sixyears in September. With the dollar trending ever closer to the 80.00 yen levelthat some see as a possible threshold for intervention, thesudden rise prompted others to jump on the move, sending thedollar even higher. But it quickly gave up its gains as talk circulated that thespike was caused by a miss-hit or technical glitch, while aJapanese Ministry of Finance official declined to comment on thesudden move. "I think there was (dollar) buying by people who thoughtthere was intervention," said a trader for a major Japanese bank. But he said: "Judging from the price action (after that), themarket probably doesn't think right now that there has been anyintervention." Japan intervened to sell yen for the first time since 2004 onSept. 15, intervening repeatedly through the Asian, European andU.S. trading day to drive the dollar up from a 15-year low. But most traders think Tokyo has refrained from interventionsince then even as Japanese policymakers continue to warn of"decisive actions" on currencies if needed. While players remain on guard against possible intervention,many traders think such steps are unlikely. Yunosuke Ikeda, senior FX strategist at Nomura Securities,said the likelihood of intervention is fairly low in particularafter the G20 meetings, where countries agreed to shuncompetitive currency devaluations. "As long as the dollar/yen's fall is mainly attributable tothe weakness of the U.S. dollar, any justification of unilateralJapanese intervention will be very difficult," he said. Unless dollar/yen falls decisively below 80.00 yen and theyen is appreciating against all other currencies, intervention isunlikely, Ikeda added. EURO, AUSSIE RISE The greenback dropped 0.6 percent against a basket of sixcurrencies. The dollar index, now at 76.83, has major support at76.67-70, which is its Oct. 25 low as well as the 76.4 percentretracement of its rebound in mid-October. The euro climbed 0.4 percent to $1.3998. Resistance lies in aband from $1.4000 to about $1.4018, which is the upper limit of acorrective triangle by Elliot Wave analysis in which the firstleg is the fall from $1.4161 on Oct. 15 to the Oct. 20  $1.3697low. Failure at $1.4018 could open the way to a move down to$1.3750, the lower boundary of the triangle. The Australian dollar rose 0.6 percent to $0.9894 afterChina's official purchasing managers' index for manufacturingbeat market expectations and hit a six-month high. Chinese data helped to lift regional currencies and shares. "It's a bit like the tail is wagging the dog but recentlywe've seen the strength in Asian currencies often precedes thedollar's decline against other majors. Today's is one of thosedays," said Koichi Yoshikawa, head of FX trading at BNP Paribasin Tokyo. The dollar is also broadly under pressure after U.S. Treasuryyields dropped on Friday, ahead of the Fed's policy meeting. Theyield on U.S. two-year notes fell near a record low. A recent Reuters poll found that most leading economistsexpect the Fed to buy between $80 billion and $100 billion inassets per month, with totals ranging widely, from $250 billionto as high as $2 trillion.
