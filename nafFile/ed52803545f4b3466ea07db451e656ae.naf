<raw><![CDATA[ * Gold hits record high, JGB yields at 8-month low * US 10-yr notes steady, some see last-minute debt deal * Dollar drops as Moody's puts U.S. on review * Euro bounces back, but debt worries linger * Asian stocks tread lower as investors cut risk By Vikram Subhedar	 HONG KONG, July 14 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Thursday,sending gold to a record high, after a Moody's warning on theUnited States' credit rating but resilience in U.S. Treasuriessuggested bond investors expected lawmakers to ultimately raisethe county's debt ceiling in time to avoid default.	 The weak dollar gave the beleagured euro a slight reprievealthough a looming Italian bond auction kept investors on edge.	 European stock markets were set for a lower start withBritain's FTSE 100 seen down 1.2 percent and Germany'sDAX down a percent. 	 Italy will likely have to pay a hefty price to sell up to 5billion euros of long-term bonds in what will be a key test ofmarket appetite for the country's debt since contagion worriessparked a sharp sell-off in its assets. 	The standoff in the U.S. Congress over raising Washington'sdebt ceiling while disagreements over a plan to reduce theballooning deficit prompted Moody's to place its Aaa rating onreview for a possible downgrade for the first time since 1996. 	 For markets, the stalled U.S. debt talks have added toworries that Europe's sovereign debt crisis is worsening.Meantime, euro zone leaders sought to break an impasse on howand when to grant Greece urgent aid. 	 The risk of a lower credit rating for the U.S. overshadowedFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's suggestion, in testimonyto Congress, that the central bank could provide more stimulusif the economy weakens further.	 "It's a very political environment right now and that'scausing all this volatility and you'd have to be too brave totake very big decisions," said Elke Schoeppl-Jost, ChiefInvestment Officer at BEA Union Investment in Hong Kong.	 "Gold is speaking its own language and I expect its risewill continue," said Schoeppl-Jost. "Especially if there is moremoney-printing from the U.S."	 The potential for another round of asset purchases by theFed, known as quantitative easing, and the Moody's warning addedup to a double whammy for the dollar.	  It slid to a four-month low of 78.48 against the yen earlier in the day before regaining some ground to hit a sessionhigh of 79.01 on talk that a U.S. bank was a buyer of dollars. .	 The stronger yen drove demand for Japanese government bondswith the yield on 10-year JGBs dropping below1.085 percent to an eight-month low and the benchmark Nikkei stock index which ended 0.3 percent lower.	 Exporters were hit by the yen's rise with Sony Corp down a percent and Toyota off 0.8 percent.	 Adding a layer of uncertainty to already jittery markets, asenior official at Japan's Ministry of Finance said it waspossible Japan could intervene in the market without giving anyadvance warning. 	 The White House and Congress must forge a deal to raiseAmerica's debt limit by Aug. 2 or the government will run out ofmoney to pay its bills and default on some obligations. But theyhave so far failed due to a sharp divide over taxes.	   DOLLAR WOES	 The U.S. currency was on the run in Asia hitting a freshrecord low against the Swiss franc around 0.8082 francs earlier while the euro rose to $1.4177 after having fallento as low as $1.3984.	 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was down 0.2percent at 75.092 , having tumbled for a high of 76.053.	 The Moody's warning has intensified pressure on U.S.lawmakers to scramble together a deal to avert a debt default.	 "We believe that the most likely scenario is that theMoody's statement provides motivation for a more serious push toa political compromise and USD selling on this factor mayunwind," said Steve Englander, head of G10 foreign exchangestrategy at Citigroup.	 Gold powered to a fresh record on course for a ninthsuccessive day of gains, matching a similar winning streak in2006. 	 Elsewhere in Asia, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan was trading down 0.3 percent lower with Hong Kong's Hang Sengindex down 0.3 percent.	 "From a macro perspective and even a fundamental perspectiveAsia is in a much stronger position than the West, but you can'tlook at Asia in isolation," said Catherine Yeung, investmentdirector at Fidelity Investments in Hong Kong.	 "You look at market turnover and it's been incredibly thin.From a fund flow point of view, the biggest risk for AsiaPacific markets still remains what's going in the U.S. andEurope," said Yeung, who added that there were buyingopportunites based on valuations for long-term investors inAsia.	 Thomas Kwan, Head of Asian Debt Investment at Baring AssetManagement, said a U.S. technical default "would be troublesometo the market, even for a very short period of time. Look atwhat happened to Italy on Monday." 	 "But this will not mean real money accounts will actuallysell heavily into this event as investors will still believethat the US will at least come up with a plan to service debtvery quickly, if not, it would be disastrous for the globalfinancial system global and economy."		  * For Reuters Global Investing Blog, click on 	 http://blogs.reuters.com/globalinvesting 	* For the Macro Scope Blog, click on 	 http://blogs.reuters.com/macroscope 	 * For Hedge Fund Blog, click on 	 http://blogs.reuters.com/hedgehub		 (Additional reporting by Umesh Desai; Editing by RichardBorsuk)	              ]]></raw>
