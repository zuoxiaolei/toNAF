<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The pound pulled back from a three-week high against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, trimming gains made after ratings agency Moody’s warned that the U.S. may lose its top-notch credit rating.GBP/USD pulled back from 1.6193, the pair’s highest since June 22, to hit 1.6108 during early European, easing up 0.03%. Cable was likely to find support at 1.5904, Wednesday’s low and resistance at 1.6262, the high of June 22.Late Wednesday, Moody’s Investors Service said that it placed the U.S. government’s Aaa bond rating on review for possible downgrade, citing “a small but rising risk” of a short-lived default, amid a standoff in the U.S. Congress over raising the country's debt ceiling.The rating would likely be reduced to the Aa range and there is no assurance Moody’s would return its top rating even if a default is quickly cured.The greenback was also pressured after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said that the central bank was examining several untested means to stimulate growth if conditions deteriorate, including another round of asset purchases or quantitative easing.Testifying before lawmakers in Washington on Wednesday, Bernanke said policymakers expect the U.S. economic recovery "will likely remain moderate” with the unemployment rate falling "only gradually."Meanwhile, the pound was down against the euro, with EUR/GBP rising 0.27% to hit 0.8819.Greece’s credit rating was cut three levels by ratings agency Fitch to CCC, its lowest grade for any country in the world, saying that a default was a “real possibility.”Later in the day, the euro zone was also to release official data on consumer price inflation.Meanwhile, the U.S. was to release a string of economic data, beginning with a report on retail sales, producer price inflation, as well as weekly government data on initial jobless claims. Also Thursday, Fed Chair Ben Bernanke was to deliver the second part of his testimony on monetary policy in Washington.             ]]></raw>
