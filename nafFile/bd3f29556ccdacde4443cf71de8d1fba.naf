<raw><![CDATA[ * Positive factory data drives most stock markets higher * Aussie hit by surprise c.bank move keeping rates steady * European shares seen dipping; U.S. stocks also seen soft * Yen rises against major currencies; euro slides vs USD By Dean Yates SINGAPORE, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Resource stocks lifted Asianshares off three-month lows on Tuesday after strong U.S.manufacturing data raised hopes the global economic recoverywas on a firmer footing. But the Australian dollar sank, pulling down the euro,after the country's central bank left interest rates unchangedin a move that stunned markets and underscored investornervousness about the impact of China's policy tightening.   European stocks were set to dip as investors awaited morecorporate results and digested the Reserve Bank of Australia'sdecision to skip an interest rate rise. U.S. stock futures also pointed to a softer open after WallStreet rose 1.1 percent on Monday on the manufacturing sectordata The RBA, in explaining its decision, cited the impact ofhigher mortgage rates at home while noting that China had begunto rein back stimulus in its economy -- a tightening processthat has transfixed global markets in recent weeks. Resource-rich Australia has been a major beneficiary ofChina's sharp rebound and its seemingly insatiable demand formetals and other raw materials. Investors get nervous when "they feel that in the strongestengine of growth, which is China, there is a little bit of abrake being put on an extremely fast car", said Khiem Do, headof the Asia multi-asset group at Baring Asset Management, whichoversees $50 billion. Japan's Nikkei stock average ended 1.63 percent higher,helped by Toyota Motor Corp, which surged 4.5 percent after itdetailed plans on Monday to fix millions of vehicles equippedwith faulty accelerators in North America and Europe. The jump in the world's top automaker comes after about an18 percent tumble over the last seven business days. Australian miners were among the best performers in Asia asmetals prices rose on prospects for the world economy. Thosestocks, as well as retailers bouyed by the RBA's decision tohold interest rates steady, helped Australian stocks rally 1.8percent. Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan as measured by MSCI wereup 0.22 percent, climbing from 3-month lows. South Korean andTaiwan shares bucked the overall trend, ending down. MSCI's Asia exJapan resources index was up 1.7 percent, thebiggest contributor to the rise in Asian shares. REACTION TO AUSTRALIA RATE DECISION The yen rose off earlier lows against major currencieswhile the Australian dollar slid about a full cent against thedollar in a matter of minutes after the RBA held its key cashrate steady at 3.75 percent, defying market expectations for arate rise to 4.0 percent. The sharp reaction in the Australian dollar, a popularhigh-yielding investment target, spilled over into other majorcurrencies, with the euro initially sliding against the dollar. "It is a surprise given the pace of domestic data," saidJosh Williamson, markets economist at Citi, referring to theRBA decision. "It seems the RBA has been buoyed by the Chineseauthorities seeking to reduce some of their stimulus and thefact there have been lots of market concerns about somesovereigns." The Aussie dollar shed 1.1 percent against the U.S. dollarto $0.8811, and fell 1 percent against the yen to 79.94 yen The euro fell to an intraday low near $1.3885 but latertrimmed its losses to stand at $1.3928, little changed on theday. Markets are bracing for a big week with other major centralbank meetings across the world and a raft of economic reportsout of the United States, culminating in the non-farm payrollsdata on Friday. Baring's Khiem Do said the key to positive economic datadriving strong stock markets higher this year would be finaldemand in the United States, Europe and Japan. "There is still a big question mark over that, which is whyI think we will continue to see volatility in terms of whatinvestors think about their growth prospects for this year," hesaid, referring to the world's major industrialised regions. The United States, Europe and Japan have been the slowestto recover from the 2008-2009 global financial crisis andgovernment stimulus measures are still a major factorsupporting their economies. Oil pared gains as the dollar strengthened, with themarket's attention turning to forecasts for steady U.S. crudeinventories after prices topped $75 earlier on optimism aboutthe economy. March U.S. crude was up 22 cents at $74.65 at 0640 GMT,after touching $75.44 earlier, a rebound of over $3 from lastweek's 2010 lows. (Editing by Kim Coghill)             ]]></raw>
