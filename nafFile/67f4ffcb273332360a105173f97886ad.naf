<raw><![CDATA[ * Release could indicate new thinking in Cuban government * Havana's move sends positive signal to U.S., Europe * Economic needs seen tied to prisoners' release By Jeff Franks HAVANA, July 12 (Reuters) - The Cuban government'ssurprising decision to free 52 political prisoners enablesPresident Raul Castro to reduce political friction both insideand outside Cuba, and focus on pulling the island out offinancial crisis, Cubans and Cuba experts said. They said Castro appeared to be moving to put aside anissue that has long damaged Cuba's international image, tradeand diplomatic relations to the detriment of its economy. "I think the prisoners are being released for a combinationof reasons, but all related to the need for tourism, trade andinvestment to alleviate the economic catastrophe that Cuba issliding into," Miami-based attorney Timothy Ashby toldReuters. "The prisoners, especially the hunger strikers, are aninternational embarrassment and complicate relations withtrading partners," said Ashby, formerly a U.S. CommerceDepartment official in charge of trade with Cuba and theCaribbean. The immediate goals, he said, may be to send a positivesignal to the United States and Europe, where key decisionsaffecting Cuba could be made in coming months. Cuba wants the U.S. Congress to pass a pending bill thatwould end a longstanding ban on Americans traveling to theisland -- part of a 48-year-old U.S. trade embargo -- whichcould bring a flood of U.S. tourists and much needed revenuesto the cash-strapped island. Recent visiting U.S. trade delegations said Cuban officialshad urged them to go back and lobby for the bill's passage. Castro has sought improved relations with the EuropeanUnion and pushed for the group to amend its common position,which ties full economic cooperation to the release ofpolitical prisoners and improved human rights. His hopes for a change earlier this year, when Spain ledthe 27-nation bloc, were dashed by human rights controversies,but the EU is to revisit the issue in September. STRUGGLING CUBAN ECONOMY Castro "surely knows that a substantial prisoner release islikely to draw a reaction from Washington and Europe, as itshould," said Phil Peters, a Cuba expert at the LexingtonInstitute think tank in Arlington, Virginia. The Cuban leader, who succeeded his older brother FidelCastro as president in 2008, has his hands full trying tomodernize Cuba's economy, battered by damaging hurricanes, theglobal financial crisis and chronic inefficiencies. He has taken small steps toward economic reform and therehave been hints of larger ones to come. But since Feb. 23, when imprisoned dissident Orlando ZapataTamayo died in a hunger strike seeking better jail conditions,Cuba has been widely condemned for its human rights record. Zapata's death was followed immediately by a long,life-threatening hunger strike by dissident Guillermo Farinas.Government-directed harassment of the dissident "Ladies inWhite" group during March and April marches by the women alsoadded to the international criticism of Cuban authorities. Both Farinas and the Ladies in White were demanding therelease of prisoners included in the 52 to be freed. The prisoner release has, for now, quieted foreign criticsand may help Castro focus on economic improvement, said AnyaLandau French, a Cuba expert at the New America Foundationthink tank in Washington. "Why is Raul doing this? It could be because of internal orexternal backlash, or to get a distraction off their platewhile they focus on the economy," she said. REACTION AGAINST STAGNATION Farinas ended his hunger strike the day after the releaseswere announced. Ladies in White leader Laura Pollan said onSunday the group will continue its weekly protest marches untilCuba frees all of its estimated 167 political prisoners. But the group's central issue was the release of the 52,their sons and husbands arrested in a 2003 crackdown. Cuba wants to send the freed prisoners and their familiesto Spain, and so far most have accepted the offer. That meansmany of the Ladies in White may soon be gone. Dissident Miriam Leiva said freeing the prisoners both"resolves a great injustice" and reduces an issue "that hasstood in the way of any type of internal or external opening." "The Cuban people have a lot of opinions ... and I thinkeven in the goverment that this society cannot continue to bestagnant," she said. Ashby said the release indicated that new blood wasbeginning to assert itself in the Cuban leadership. It "signals a broader change in the sense that the younger,business-oriented generation of Cubans in positions ofgovernment leadership are uncomfortable with archaic repressionand the commercial complications it creates," he said. But it remained to be seen, experts said, how the UnitedStates will respond to the prisoner release. Washington has demanded the freeing of political prisonersas a condition for improved relations, but may not be in a moodfor major change due to the detention in December of U.S.contractor Alan Gross in Cuba on suspicion of espionage. U.S. officials and his employers have said he was not a spybut was in Cuba facilitating Internet access to Jewish groups. "I don't know if this (U.S.) administration, timid and notvery active so far regarding Cuba, will respond," Peters said.
