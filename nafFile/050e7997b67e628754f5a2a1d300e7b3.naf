<raw><![CDATA[ * Developing countries keep up push for more influence * Face resistance in gaining parity at IMF, World Bank * G20 may be better forum to reassert power By Ana Nicolaci da Costa BRASILIA, April 20 (Reuters) - Developing countries willthis week demand a louder voice at the World Bank and the IMF,now that they are contributing more funds and it's a euro zonecountry, Greece, that is in need of a rescue plan. The United States and Europe, which have long dominated theWashington-based international institutions, acknowledge thegrowing clout of the emerging market economies such as Chinaand Brazil but are loathe to part with their power. Brazil, Russia, India and China, the so-called BRIC club ofbig emerging economies, called for swift reforms in the globalinstitutions when their leaders gathered in Brasilia last weekahead of key financial meetings in Washington. [ID:nN15250971] That was like "a pressurizing device to make it obvious tothe developed world that our global organizations are no longerrepresentative of the world economy," said Goldman Sachseconomist Jim O'Neill, who coined the term BRIC in 2001. Brazil and other developing countries have been calling fora 6.0 percent shift in voting power at the World Bank. Thatwould bring the representation between developing and developedcountries at the institution to parity. "We can no longer accept a situation in which the majorityof the world's people remain inadequately represented in suchbodies," South African President Jacob Zuma said during arecent visit to Brazil. A Brazilian government source conceded that Brazil waspessimistic about achieving an equal say for developed anddeveloping economies at the World Bank. [ID:nN15154776] Brazil would keep pushing for parity in the long term butthat a smaller shift of a little over 3.0 percent and up to 4.0percent would be acceptable for now, Rogerio Studart, whorepresents Brazil and other developing countries on the WorldBank's board, told Reuters. "We will try to push for as much as we can but we are awarethat we are at the end of the negotiations," Studart said.  The shift would not achieve parity but would helprebalance a breakdown that now stands at roughly 40 percent fordeveloping countries and 60 percent for developed nations. "A profound change in the structure of the IMF is needed sothat all countries can trust in it and know that it isobjective," said Nestor Stancanelli, deputy secretary forinternational economic negotiations for Argentina. CHANGING TIMES When the financial crisis in 2008 pushed rich economies tothe brink of a depression, the world turned to emerging powerslike China to spend more to cushion the global economic slump. Now that the BRICs are helping to drive global economicgrowth and to fill International Monetary Fund coffers, thereis a growing consensus that the international institutionsshould reflect their new importance. Brazil has committed to buy up to $10 billion of IMF bondsand China up to $50 billion. But Europe and other rich countries are concerned aboutshifting voting power. Europe has long dominated the IMF andselects its head. Many in Europe see a dilution of voting powerequal to losing sway over global economic issues. Analysts argue that the longer emerging economic powers aredenied a greater say in the institutions, the more likely it isthese institutions will become irrelevant and ineffective. "Increased income and growth in the developing world meansincreasing influence," World Bank President Robert Zoellicksaid last week said in a speech. "Today's discussion requires abig table to accommodate the key participants, and developingcountries must have seats at it."  While emerging economies bounced back more quickly fromthe financial crisis, the Greece's debt problems and the riskthat it may have to be bailed out by the IMF highlighted howfragile developed economies remain. G20 ALTERNATIVE As well as pushing for change at the IMF and World Bank,analysts say emerging economies should also help foster the G20group of leading developed and developing economies. "Perhaps the question is not so much how hard they shouldpush for greater representation in international financialinstitutions but how they should try to strengthen the G20,increase its clout and make that clout sustainable," saidMatias Spektor, who coordinates the center for internationalrelations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Rio de Janeiro. Last year, G20 leaders agreed the group should take overfrom the G7 as the main forum for managing the world economy. "Everyone's talking about the death of the G7 but it's veryplausible to think that within the next five years, if the G20fails to deliver, then to see a return to some more traditionalways of managing the global economy," Spektor said.
