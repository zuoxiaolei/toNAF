<raw><![CDATA[ * WSJ story on German concession possibility spursshort-covering * Dollar under pressure broadly as US data eyed * Yen slides after Moody's follows Fitch in cutting Japanrating outlook * Kiwi shines, hits fresh post-float high By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, May 31 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a three-weekpeak against the dollar on Tuesday after a wave ofshort-covering triggered by a report saying Germany could makeconcessions on efforts to put together a bailout for Greece,with traders eyeing $1.45 as its next target. Germany is considering dropping its push for an earlyrescheduling of Greek bonds in order to facilitate a newpackage of aid loans for Greece, the Wall Street Journalreported, citing people familiar with the matter.[ID:nL3E7GU21K] "The euro zone problems appear to be subsiding for now. Orputting it another way, the market appears to have stoppedlooking at them as a factor for now," said Teppei Ino, acurrency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, adding thatthe market could now focus on the heavy schedule for U.S. datareleases this week. The euro rose as high as $1.4407 , its highest inthree weeks, piercing its 55-day moving average of $1.4334 andalso $1.4373, the top of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart. "The euro has gone through all the stop-loss levels I heardabout this morning. It is very strong on the charts, and it'sbouncing back now having hit a double-bottom of $1.4048 on May16 and $1.3968 on May 2 3," said a trader at a Japanese bank. "It also breached resistance at the top of the Ichimokucloud, and the nearest resistance is seen at $1.45," said thetrader adding that the level has become crucial after the euromoved around it in mid-April. The European Union is racing to draft a second bailoutpackage for Greece to release vital loans next month and avertthe risk of it defaulting, EU officials said on Monday.[ID:nLDE74T0LG] Jean-Claude Juncker, the chairman of euro zone financeministers, said he was optimistic after discussing further aidfor Athens with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris. Moves to plug a looming funding gap for 2012 and 2013accelerated after the International Monetary Fund said lastweek it will withhold the next tranche of aid due on June 29unless the EU guarantees to meet Athens' funding needs for nextyear. DOLLAR DIPS The dollar's index against a basket of currencies fell toits lowest level in three weeks, losing 0.5 percent to 74.568 <=USD>, having broken below support on the Ichimokucloud bottom at 74.89. The dollar has been hurt by a recent batch of disappointingU.S. data, with many traders thinking that important numbersthis week, such as ISM manufacturing and payroll data, couldcement the view that the U.S. recovery may remain slow for now.  "The dollar came under pressure ahead of U.S. jobs dataand manufacturing figures due this week. Macro funds areoffloading positions in the dollar as they expect slightlyweaker figures after a bout of weak data earlier this month,"said Koji Fukaya, chief currency analyst at Credit Suisse inTokyo. The dollar also fell 0.2 percent against the Swiss franc to0.85 franc , a stone's throw from a record low of 0.8457hit on Monday while the pound rose 0.4 percent to $1.6543, its highest in four weeks. The Australian dollar also gained 0.23 percent to $1.0713, quickly recovering from small losses posted afterweaker-than-expected Australian export data. The New Zealand dollar did even better, jumping 1.0 percentto as high as $0.8264 , a fresh post-float high[ID:nL3E7GU1YW]. The yen failed to benefit from overall dollar weakness,slipping after Moody's said it had placed its rating on Japanunder review for possible downgrade, less than a week afterrival rating firm Fitch cut its outlook on Japan's debt. The dollar gained 0.36 percent to 81.23 yen  whilethe euro jumped more than 1.3 percent to 116.88 yen, itshighest since May 20. The euro moved from near its support at its 100-day movingaverage at 115.32 yen to 116.77 yen, zeroing in on immediateresistance at its 55-day moving average at 117.43 yen. The yenalso dropped 0.8 percent against sterling . (Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski and MasayukiKitano; Editing by Joseph Radford)             ]]></raw>
