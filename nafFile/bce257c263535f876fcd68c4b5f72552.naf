<raw><![CDATA[ By Leika Kihara TOKYO, March 17 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is leaningtowards loosening its monetary policy on Wednesday, which maybriefly reduce government pressure for action to support theeconomy although it will do little to mitigate deflation. The government has been prodding the BOJ to ease policy toprevent a rise in the yen from derailing an export-drivenrecovery and deepening the country's deflation, analysts say. News earlier this month that the central bank was consideringan expansion or extension of a lending operation it put in placeat an emergency meeting in December sparked a rally in stocks anda fall in the yen. The bond yield curve steepened. Those market positions could unwind if the Bank of Japanstands pat on Wednesday, which is possible since board membershave disagreed over how to justify loosening already ultra-loosepolicy when the economy is picking up in line with BOJ forecasts. That could mean the central bank delays such a move untilApril. Some analysts say that expanding or extending the fundingoperation would merely fill a hole left by another marketoperation that expires in March, so it wouldn't qualify asmonetary easing, let alone extra support for the economy. "Frankly, expanding the fund-pumping operation won't havemuch effect on the economy. But it doesn't do much harm either,"said Koichi Haji, chief economist at NLI Research Institute. "Holding off an easing may trigger a yen rise and give thegovernment an excuse to blame the BOJ for the weak economy. Idon't think the BOJ would like that to happen." The five-year/20-year yield spread widened by 2.5 basispoints to 165.5 basis points on Tuesday, edging closer to adecade-high above 167 basis points struck last week. The government and the Bank of Japan agree that the economyis picking up after the shockwaves of the global financialcrisis. But the government has been needling the BOJ to ease policybecause it wants to keep the yen from rising further, analystssaid. The yen fell after the emergency meeting in December. With surveys showing its support slipping ahead of upperhouse elections later this year, the government is worried that arising yen will undermine exports and translate into cheaperimports, so adding to deflationary pressure, analysts say. The BOJ was also under pressure from the government tosupport the economy when it called the December meeting andintroduced an operation to offer 10 trillion yen in three-monthbank loans at the policy rate of 0.1 percent. That reduced market rates for borrowing yen and helped thecurrency pull back from a 14-year high against the dollar. That pool of funds might be doubled to 20 trillion yen onWednesday, or the loan period might be extended to six months. (Editing by Neil Fullick)             ]]></raw>
