<raw><![CDATA[ * EconMin suggests German economy to grow more than forecast * Says Germany on path to sustainable growth  (Adds quotes, background) BERLIN, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Economy Minister Rainer Bruederleexpects the German economy to grow by at least 3.4 percent thisyear, he said on Thursday, suggesting the expansion could bestronger than the government last forecast. In October, the government raised its 2010 growth forecastto 3.4 percent from a previous estimate of 1.4 percent.[ID:nBAE003834] Berlin is due to issue its next official growthprojections in mid-January. "We expect economic growth of at least 3.4 percent for thisyear," Bruederle told Reuters. "And we are on a good path tolasting, sustainable growth." Germany suffered its biggest post-war recession in 2009 whenits economy contracted 4.7 percent as global demand plummeted.Yet it emerged faster than expected from the slump and left mostother euro zone countries trailing in its wake. Forward-looking indicators suggest Europe's largest economyis now poised to strengthen its performance, with domesticdemand playing an ever-more important role. Strong data has led forecasters to boost their growthforecasts, with most more upbeat than the government'sestimates. The Bundesbank now expects the economy to grow 3.6percent in 2010 and reach pre-crisis levels by 2011. (Reporting by Gernot Heller, writing by Paul Carrel; Editingby Ron Askew)             ]]></raw>
