<raw><![CDATA[ *Cuban commentator suggests larger private role in economy *Says economic crisis may open door to reforms By Marc Frank HAVANA, July 28 (Reuters) - Cash-strapped Cuba shouldconsider putting more of its state-run economy in the hands ofproducers, as President Raul Castro has done with agriculture,the country's top economic commentator said on Tuesday. Ariel Terrero, during his regular Tuesday appearance onstate-run television, did not call for private management, butsuggested that sectors such as food services and retail couldperform better if they were run in a new way. "In the Cuban economy, there's a need to look for formulasmore dynamic, more intelligent, of understanding property, ofrunning a business, of running a cafeteria," he said. About 90 percent of communist-led Cuba's economy is understate control. Terrero pointed to Castro-led reforms in the island'sagriculture that include decentralization of decision-making,greater emphasis on private cooperatives and farms, and theleasing of state lands to some 80,000 individuals. "The leasing of state lands, which in the end is theplacing of state property in the hands of producers, could beapplied in other sectors, for example food services, retailtrade, and other areas where really it is impossible, given thediversity and breadth, for the state to administer directly,"he said. Terrero, who regularly comments on economic affairs inCuba's tightly controlled state media, said big, concentratedoperations such as nickel plants, sugar mills, hotels and thepower grid were not the same as an appliance repair shop or acafeteria. "I think this diversity requires new thinking about theconcepts and manner of understanding property in the Cubaneconomy," he said. Raul Castro replaced ailing brother Fidel last year andsince then has pushed for a more efficient and streamlinedgovernment and economy. He replaced his economic Cabinet in March amid the worstfinancial crisis Cuba has gone through since the demise offormer benefactor the Soviet Union in 1991. Terrero said the current difficulties could open the way toreform, pointing out that in the 1990s crisis the economy wasopened up to foreign investment, tourism and some small familybusinesses. GOVERNMENT REPORT CONCURS His comments follow a recent government report seen byReuters that suggested similar changes. The report by the Economy and Planning Ministry blamedhurricanes, the U.S. embargo and world financial crisis for acash shortage that has forced cutbacks in imports, budgets andenergy consumption. But it also said long-standing structural problems were toblame. "State-run socialist companies must be efficient and forthat what they need for their optimal performance must beguaranteed," the report said. "The remainder of the economy must adapt to a form ofproperty better suited to the resources available," it said. Many Cuban economists have long argued that the stateshould focus on large companies and wholesale trade and get outof the retail business, which it has monopolized since 1967 andwhich the government admits is plagued by petty theft,inefficiency and abysmal service. Cuba expert Daniel Erikson at the Inter-American Dialoguethink tank in Washington said it appears the Cuban governmentmay be considering such a move. "What this tells me is that the Cuban government is onceagain wrestling with the central dilemma of how to adapt theisland's outdated economic model to changing realities," hesaid. "At bottom this is a debate about reducing the role of thestate and allowing controversial free market practices to takeroot," he said.(Editing by Jeff Franks and Eric Beech)             ]]></raw>
