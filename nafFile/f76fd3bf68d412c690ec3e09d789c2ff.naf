<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The Swiss franc strengthened against the U.S. dollar on Friday, as fears over the outlook for global economic growth and concerns over the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone saw investors flee into traditional safe haven assets.USD/CHF hit 0.7806 on Friday, the pair’s lowest since August 16; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.7846 by close of trade on Friday, almost unchanged on the week.The pair is likely to find support at 0.7547, the low of August 12 and resistance at 0.8016, the high of August 17.On Wednesday the Swiss National Bank announced fresh measures to curb the franc’s gains. The SNB said it would boost liquidity by expanding sight deposits to 200 billion francs from 120 billion, reiterating it would take additional steps if needed.The announcement disappointed investors who bet on more aggressive action such as a franc exchange rate peg to the euro.Meanwhile, the euro weakened against the Swiss franc even as the European Central Bank continued buying government bonds to keep the region’s sovereign debt crisis from spreading and European Union officials stepped up efforts to deal with the debt crisis.
