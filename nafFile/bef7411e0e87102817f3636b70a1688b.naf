<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen hits one-month high vs euro as China stocks fall * Euro up vs dollar as investors buy it on dips * Sterling falls as some BoE members wanted bigger QE (Updates prices, adds quote, detail) By Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against theyen on Wednesday after China's stock market tumbled more than 4percent, raising concern about the strength of a globaleconomic recovery and boosting the Japanese currency'ssafe-haven appeal. But a recovery in U.S. stock prices helped higher-riskassets and currencies recover losses, and the euro pushed above$1.42, on track for its biggest daily rise against the dollarin more than two weeks, "Negative sentiment hasn't disappeared but it has abated,with both the S&P  and Dow  paring losses," saidMatthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC CapitalMarkets in Toronto. "That gave the market a chance to push theeuro higher." But with trading desks thinned out by summer holidays,analysts said moves were exaggerated. Currencies were alsofollowing stock prices in the absence of fresh economic data. "These are some of the most illiquid market conditions youwill see all year, with probably about 25 percent of normalmarket volume, so this has to be put into that context," saidMichael Woolfolk, strategist at Bank of New York-Mellon. The dollar hit a one-month low against the yen and was lastdown 0.9 percent at 93.83 yen . The euro was unchanged at133.83 yen , well above a one-month low of 132.16yen. The euro rose 0.9 percent to $1.4261 , off a sessionlow of $1.4081, according to Reuters data. The yen typically gains when equities fall becauseinvestors buy it either as a safe-haven or they unwind tradesthat were financed by borrowing the currency. Woolfolk said many global investors, likely includingcentral banks in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, aretaking profits on recent dollar strength and buying euros andother currencies at lower levels. "Their desire is to diversify their large dollar reservesand they've been doing that," he said. Writing in The New York Times on Wednesday, billionaireinvestor Warren Buffett warned that the "gusher of federalmoney" aimed at rescuing the U.S. economy will in the long runundermine the dollar. Excess spending in Britain has also hit sterling hard oflate. The currency fell sharply earlier after minutes from theBank of England's last meeting showed some board members,including Governor Mervyn King, wanted an even bigger expansionin the bank's asset-purchasing program. [ID:nBOE002011] Sterling last traded down 0.1 percent at $1.6540 ,having recovered from a $1.6392 session low. Asset purchasesrequire the BoE to print money, which some investors fear maylead to an oversupply of sterling and eventual inflation. Still, analysts said the market mood was tentative. Strausssaid he expects the yen to remain well bid and the dollar toresume gains against the euro in the near-term as investorsgrow weary of pushing stocks higher. The Shanghai stock market's plunge, is "setting a very badtone indeed for the rest of the global markets," saidindependent investor Dennis Gartman, author of The GartmanLetter.
