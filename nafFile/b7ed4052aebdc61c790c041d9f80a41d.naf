<raw><![CDATA[ By Natsuko Waki LONDON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Investors may be forced into abigger re-appraisal of risks attached to holding euro zonegovernment bonds, a process which could weigh on a wider groupof risky assets as the year draws to a close. Uncertainty over a new euro zone crisis mechanism andwhether newly issued bonds would include a clause that couldforce creditors to take losses is fanning fresh risk aversion. The euro hit a fresh two-month low against the dollar whilethe cost of insuring debt against a default by peripheral eurozone countries and banks rose. World stocks are down about twopercent in the past week. A key European barometer of investor anxiety, VDAX-NEWvolatility index, leapt 15 percent at one point on Friday to aseven-week high. An Irish Times report that the International Monetary Fundand the European Union are examining how senior bondholderscould be compelled to pay some of the costs of rescuingIreland's banks also put focus on private sector burden sharing. "If you change the basis on which you issue debt, there willbe an impact on debt. It is a signal that the private sectorneeds to price risk appropriately," said Philip Poole, head ofmacro and investment strategy at HSBC Global Asset Management. "There was a perception that the euro zone umbrellaprotected creditors. There was mispricing of (peripheral) debtrelative to Bund. And the mispricing led to more fiscal deficitwhich led to more problems." Practically, Germany wants private investors to face"haircuts" or other debt payment restructure measures. In orderto include them, newly issued euro zone bonds would includecollective action clauses (CACs). The CACs would allow for a country to restructure its debtrepayments should it be unable to meet them, either by extendingthe maturity of bonds, by reducing interest payments or by aso-called "haircut" -- or writedown. "This proposal, if implemented, could have a potentiallynegative impact on financial markets... As CACs would only beapplied to new debt, it would essentially split the bond marketinto two and thus reduce liquidity," Barclays Capital said in anote to clients. "It could also make it more difficult for sovereigns such asIreland, Portugal, Spain and Greece to issue new debt." According to JP Morgan, European bond managers increasedtheir underweights in peripheral bonds over the past two weeksclose to levels seen in June. For some bondholders of Irish banks the restructuringprocess has already begun. Last Monday, a group of creditors holding subordinated debtof nationalised lender Anglo Irish Bank agreed to take an 80percent writedown on the value of their holdings. In one possible scheme, bank debt would be converted intoequity shares. In the second, investors would be given thechoice of injecting fresh capital into the banks or face a cutin their investment.  ECB EXIT RISKS The other risk for investors is a hawkish stance from someEuropean Central Bank policymakers.  The ECB, increasingly impatient with banks reliant on itscrisis loans, will say next Thursday how much of its support --mostly ultra-easy loans for banks -- will remain in place beyondmid-January.  A few ECB policymakers are also due to speak in the comingweek. Analysts expect the ECB will limit its three-month lendingbut doubts have crept in given Ireland debt concerns andcontagion fears. BNP Paribas believes normalisation of repo operations isunlikely to be enough and soon German officials will push forinterest rate hikes. Based on the Taylor rule on monetary policy, the bankcalculates that Ireland's boom was fuelled by interest rates 500basis points below the level most suitable for the country. The bust is being intensified by rates 1,100 bps above thelevel that is now consistent with the Taylor rule. For Germany,the economy is in the boom phase of the cycle and creditconditions are improving yet real rates are negative, it says. "If some view the ECB's current stance as astonishing, theyare likely to fall over when some on the ECB start pushing forhigher rates next year, which they will long before the Fed evendreams of that," the bank said in a note to clients. "We expect to see German officials pushing for a rate hikenext year. It is not our forecast that the ECB will deliver, butit is a clear risk. That cannot be good news for the peripheraleconomies of the eurozone." The ECB's in-house economists will also publish a new set ofgrowth and inflation forecasts in the coming week.
