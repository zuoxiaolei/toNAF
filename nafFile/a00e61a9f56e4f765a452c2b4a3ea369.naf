<raw><![CDATA[ * Financial markets regaining calm but euro stays heavy * Euro close to record low on Swiss franc * Aussie edges up after employment jumps in April By Kaori Kaneko TOKYO, May 13 (Reuters) - The euro edged up against thedollar on Thursday but remained vulnerable near a recent 14-monthlow on concerns about the risk of a sovereign debt crisis in theeuro zone and the impact of fiscal measures on the region'sgrowth. Gains in the euro are likely to be limited as investors areexpected to use any rallies as an opportunity to sell it, traderssaid, and it hovered near a recent record low against the Swissfranc set at 1.4005 francs. The Australian dollar nudged higher after data showed thedomestic economy added 33,700 jobs in April, handily beatingforecasts for a 20,000 rise. "Financial markets overall have been returning to calm butthe euro remains on a downtrend," said Kosuke Hanao, head oftreasury product sales at HSBC in Japan. "Although the panic sell-off in the euro has eased at themoment, the downside risk still remains." The euro edged up 0.4 percent from late U.S. trade onWednesday to $1.2658 but remained within sight of its 14-monthlow near $1.25 hit last week. Near-term psychological support forthe euro is seen at that level but some in the market see thecurrency falling below $1.2400 as it did in 2008. Traders cited market talk of decent bids in the euro at$1.2610/20 and also ahead of an option barrier at $1.2600. Against the yen, the euro rose 0.3 percent to 117.97 yen,having fallen to a eight-year low of 110.49 yen on tradingplatform EBS last week. In the week to May 8, Japanese investors dumped a net 1.57trillion ($16.8 billion) of overseas bonds, the heaviest netselling since 2.11 trillion from the week to April 4 last year,data from Japan's finance ministry showed. The figure came despite the fact that there were only twotrading days last week due to Japan's "Golden week" holidays andthe move may have contributed to the yen's sharp appreciationlast week, although it may not have been the main driver. A market source said the massive selling of foreign bonds byJapanese investors last week was led by the banking sector, whichtrimmed positions in medium-term to long-term foreign bonds. Since Japanese investors were net buyers of foreign stockslast week, the selling of foreign bonds may not be a simple caseof fund repatriation, the source added. Japanese banks often invest in foreign bonds in a manner thatdoes not involve taking on foreign exchange risk, and anyunwinding of such positions would not have a direct impact oncurrency moves. Although the euro drew support from Spain's spending cuts anda successful bond sale in Portugal on Wednesday, worries abouteuro zone economic growth continued to weigh on the currency. "The next question will be how debt-stricken nations in theeuro zone can manage to cut their fiscal deficits," said JunKato, senior manager of investment at Shinkin Asset Management. "People are still looking at Europe now but fundamentalsgenerally are expected to return as a trading factor, givenrelatively good economic numbers in the U.S. and steady stockmarkets." Firm stocks and the Aussie's moderate rise after the datahelped investor sentiment slightly, traders said. The Australian dollar advanced 0.6 percent to $0.9000. Italso rose 0.6 percent to 83.83 yen.  Sterling climbed 0.2 percent to $1.4855, trimming some ofits losses from the previous day, when it fell 0.7 percent, hurtby the Bank of England's dovish outlook for UK growth andinflation in its quarterly inflation report. The euro was little changed near 85.24 pence. The dollar edged down 0.1 percent to 93.18 yen. A trader fora Japanese bank cited Japanese exporters offers at levels above93.00 yen.
