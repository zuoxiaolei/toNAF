<raw><![CDATA[ * Market moves don't change Japan economic recovery - Arai * Signs of slow U.S. growth affecting markets - Arai * Japan coincident indicator falls first time in 14 months (Adds details, direct quote) By Stanley White TOKYO, July 6 (Reuters) - Japanese policymakers said onTuesday they were closely watching falling share prices andrecent rises in yen, which are clouding the outlook for theexport-reliant economy's fragile recovery. National Strategy Minister Satoshi Arai, who is alsoeconomics minister, said financial markets were reacting to signsthat a recovery in the U.S. economy is not as strong as some hadanticipated. Though he said the market turmoil so far has had littleimpact on Japan's gradual recovery from recession that startedlast year, analysts worry that further gains in the yen coulddampen business sentiment and slow corporate capital spending. Japan's coincident indicator of economic activity fell in Mayfor the first time in more than a year, data showed on Tuesday,highlighting economists' forecasts that growth is likely to slowthis year as a recovery in exports moderates. "We need to closely watch whether stock declines and yengains will continue," Arai told a news conference. "Market moves don't change the recovery trend for Japan'seconomy. I don't take declines in global stocks as a sign thatthe economic trend is changing." Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda also said on Tuesday he isclosely monitoring moves in the share and currency markets. Prime Minister Naoto Kan is trying to convince voters beforean election for parliament's upper house on Sunday that hisruling Democratic Party can spur growth while also repairing thecountry's tattered public finances with higher taxes. The yen has made solid gains against the greenback in recentdays on the back of growing worries about the U.S. economy. Thedollar was around 87.50 yen, not far from a seven-month low of86.94 yen struck on July 1. The Nikkei slumped to a seven-month low on Tuesday afterEuropean shares closed at their lowest level in nearly six weeksas weak data on Chinese manufacturing and the U.S. labour marketweighed on investor sentiment. Wall Street was closed on Mondayfor a public holiday. Japan's coincident index of economic indicators fell 0.1point in May from April, the Cabinet Office said on Tuesday, forthe first decline in 14 months. The index of leading economic indicators, which is compiledusing data such as the number of job offers and consumersentiment and is a gauge of the economy a few months ahead, fell3.0 points from April, the second consecutive month of decline. "The impact on the markets from Europe and the waning affectof government stimulus is a source of some uncertainty," KeisukeTsumura, a parliamentary secretary of the Cabinet Office, toldreporters at a briefing. "However, these factors are not having a direct impact on theprospects for a sustainable recovery in Japan."
