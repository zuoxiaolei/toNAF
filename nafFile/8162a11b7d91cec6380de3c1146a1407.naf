<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen so far unaffected after report Fujii to resign * Cross/yen's sharp rebound give a lift to dlr/yen * Eyes on possible policy changes if Fujii replaced By Satomi Noguchi TOKYO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The dollar edged up against the yenon Wednesday in a choppy trade, recovering from the previousday's sharp fall when traders locked in gains on the greenback'srally over the past month ahead of U.S. jobs data later thisweek. The dollar regained strength versus the yen as othercurrencies rebounded sharply against the Japanese currency afterinvestors finished up liquidating yen-selling positions, traderssaid. Volatile currency moves in the past few days have beenlargely driven by position adjustments, while the market remainsfocused on Friday's payrolls data which is expected to shape theoutlook for a rate hike from the Federal Reserve and thedirection of the dollar. "Market players do not have clear idea how currencies willreact after the U.S. jobs report on Friday, and they want tohedge against both upside and downside risks for the dollar,"said a trader at a Japanese trust bank. "Currency moves may continue to be choppy before Friday," thetrader said. Traders said the market had not been affected by a reportthat Japan's finance minister, Hirohisa Fujii, is to step downdue to poor health. But market players were cautious about possible changes tothe government's fiscal stance and its current policies to fightdeflation, if he resigns. The dollar erased earlier losses and rose 0.2 percent to91.96 yen, rebounding higher from Tuesday's low of 91.25 yen ontrading platform EBS. The dollar had climbed to a four-month high of 93.22 yenearlier this week after a series of solid economic data lastmonth added to optimism about the U.S. economic recovery and sentlong-term Treasuries yields higher. The euro and the sterling jumped, in part due to buying fromJapanese pension funds after falling earlier, giving a lift tothe dollar versus the yen, traders said. The euro was up 0.2 percent at 131.98 yen and the pound wasup 0.1 percent at 146.91 yen. The euro was steady at $1.4355 after falling the previous dayon dollar-buying as it failed to break decisively above $1.4450. Also in focus are the ADP's employment report and ISMnon-manufacturing index for December, along with the minutes fromthe Fed's last policy meeting, all due later in the day. FUJII AND HIS SUCCESSOR The Japanese government had decided to accept Fujii'sresignation, the Nikkei newspaper cited a ruling party lawmakeras saying, despite the fact that he is one of the few experiencedmembers of the novice Democratic Party-led government. Some analysts said if Fujii were to resign, that couldpressure the yen, as some of his previous comments had given theimpression that he accepted a strong Japanese currency. "Fujii's departure could mean a weaker yen because there isnoone who has similar strong opinions about an appreciating yenexpected to replace him," said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FXstrategist in Japan for Barclays Capital. "That could mean talk of intervention will return." In late September, Fujii said dollar/yen moves then were notabnormal when the yen was testing its highs versus the dollarbelow 90 yen. But he later back-pedalled by saying he never said heapproved of a strong yen, seeking to dispel speculation the newgovernment was unlikely to intervene in foreign exchange markets. But traders said the market view is mixed and there may noteven be an impact as long as economic policy is largely unchangedand the government and the Bank of Japan continue to fightdeflation. Deputy finance minister Yoshihiko Noda, another deputyfinance minister, Naoki Minezaki, and national strategy ministerNaoto Kan are said to be among the potential candidates tosucceed Fujii.
