Market participants welcomed the appointment but said it wasunlikely to have a big impact on policy. "This is very positive news for the market. Shvetsov is veryperceptive to the market's reaction ... He has a 'good ear'.That is, he listens to market participants," said AlexanderAfanasyev, deputy chairman at WestLB Vostok bank. Alexander Morozov, chief economist at HSBC in Moscow, saidthat the appointment was widely expected and was unlikely toseriously affect the central bank's policy. Shvetsov, 41, joined the central bank's board of directorsin February 2009 when Russia announced the end of a so-calledmanaged devaluation of the rouble . He was previouslydirector of the division for operations on financial markets. Sergei Romanchuk, head of ACI Russia and chief dealer atMetallinvestbank, said the move would allow Shvetsov to commenton forex policy more often. Shvetsov takes over the position left vacant when KonstantinKorishchenko moved to MICEX exchange during the height of thecrisis in 2008. Korishchenko now heads Merill Lynch in Russia. Shvetsov was unavailable for comment. (Reporting by Andrey Ostroukh and Elena Fabrichnaya; Editing byToni Vorobyova)             ]]></raw>
