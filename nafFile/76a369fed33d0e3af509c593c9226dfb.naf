<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds comment, updates throughout)	 * Euro gains vs dollar, sterling, but fails to hold above$1.45 * Investors relieved Greek debt problems under control fornow * More euro gains possible on ECB rate rise speculation By Naomi Tajitsu	 LONDON, June 30 - The euro rose to a three-week high againstthe dollar on Thursday, swept higher by month-end demand whichhelped it extend a rally after Greece moved a step closer tosecuring international aid.	 The single currency was also buoyed after comments fromEuropean Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet reinforcedspeculation that the ECB will raise interest rates next week,helping it to a 15-month high versus sterling. 	 Markets cheered the Greek parliament's passage of toughausterity measures on Wednesday, enabling the debt-strickencountry to secure more emergency funding from the EU and theInternational Monetary Fund and staving off the threat of a debtdefault for now.	 The euro hit a high of $1.4522 versus the dollar ontrading platform EBS and analysts said further gains couldpropel it towards $1.5000. However, many remained wary aboutwhether Greece will be able to implement such harsh measures andexpected the euro's rise to be limited.	 It failed to sustain a move above $1.4500, with traderssaying demand from a semi-official European name and model fundsran into offers from sovereign names ahead of a reported optionsbarrier at $1.4550. 	 "Euro zone rates are more likely to rise than those in theU.S. and the UK and this will keep the euro supported againstthe dollar and sterling," said Richard Wiltshire, chief FXbroker at ETX Capital.	 "But I can't see a huge reason to buy the euro as Greece isnot out of the woods yet".	  Athens on Thursday is expected to pass another vote on howto implement the plan, clearing the last obstacle to the releaseof 12 billion euros ($17.3 billion) of funding, which isessential to meet debt payments by mid-July. 	 It was last up 0.2 percent at $1.4460 against the dollar,with bids in the mid-$1.44 region seen as acting as support.	 ETX's Wiltshire said the euro's gains were helped by heftymonth-end buying of euro/sterling, some of which could reverseon Friday or next week.	 The single currency was up 0.5 percent against the pound at 90.30 pence, having hit a 15-month high of 90.70pence.		 ECB RATE OUTLOOK	 Bolstering the euro was the view that the European CentralBank will raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.5 percentnext week, which would increase the single currency's rateadvantage over the dollar.	 Some analysts also saw further scope for short-term gains astalks progress on a second aid package for Greece, withinvestors taking the view that the euro zone debt crisis isunder control for the time being.	 "In the short term, at least, a Greece default is unlikely,and this is positive for the euro and also other risky assets,"said You-Na Park, currency strategist at Commerzbank inFrankfurt, adding the euro could test $1.50 in the near term.	 Others said more encouraging data in the U.S., includingrecent housing figures, and signs the Japanese economy may berecovering more quickly from its earthquake than expected, werehelping to improve the broad outlook for the global economythrough the second half of 2011.	 Deutsche currency strategist Henrik Gullberg said this viewwould further stoke risk appetite, prompting investors to takeon more long euro positions -- or bets to buy the currency --after cutting back on those positions recently.    	 "Uncertainty about the global outlook, as well as Greece,has meant that a lot of long positions in risky currencies havebeen scaled back," he said.	 At the same time, increasing concerns about the U.S. debtsituation may sour sentiment for the dollar as Washingtonstruggles to raise its budget limit.	 Gains in the euro and other currencies considered higherrisk, including the Australian and New Zealand dollars -- the latter hitting a post-float high in earliertrade -- knocked the dollar lower versus a currency basket.	 The dollar index traded 0.25 percent lower as 74.503,having hit 74.255, its weakest since mid-June. It slipped 0.4percent on the day to 80.40 yen .
