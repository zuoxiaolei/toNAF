<raw><![CDATA[   * Euro steadies after rebound from lows * But outlook bearish with players looking to sell at upticks * Tighter funding costs to drive demand for USD By Anirban Nag SYDNEY, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro was off lows onWednesday, but there was little respite in store for it asinvestors look to sell on every uptick and sentiment bearish onconcerns about the health of the euro zone's banking sector. Signs of tighter funding, with costs for banks to borrowdollars in the interbank market soaring to 10-month highs, islikely to drive investors to the relative safety of the U.S.dollar and away from riskier assets and currencies, traders said. U.S. two-year swap spreads , a key gauge offinancial system stress, also widened to one-year highs onTuesday. [ID:nLDE64O1MP] The Bank of Spain on Saturday said it had taken over a smallsavings bank, CajaSur. Analysts said the bailout highlightedweakness in the European banking sector and heightened worriesthat more banks in the euro zone may need to be bailed out. Thatis likely to see more investors fleeing the euro. In Asian trade, the euro  was down 0.3 percent at$1.2335, staying above Tuesday's low of $1.2177 which was not farfrom a four-year low of $1.2143 struck last week. The euro has lost over 7 percent against the dollar so farthis month and is heading for its biggest monthly fall sinceJanuary 2009 at current prices. The U.S. dollar index , which tracks the greenbackagainst a basket of six currencies, was down at 86.59. Againstthe yen, the dollar was higher at 90.44 yen  from 90.18 yenlate in New York on Tuesday. Against the yen, the euro was at 111.44 yen, recovering fromaround 108.85 yen  -- its lowest since late November2001 -- struck on Tuesday. Investors generally flock to the yenand the U.S. dollar when risk aversion and volatility spikes. "The best hope for stability will come when cyclical exposurehas been wound down, but the latest IMM and Japanese retail datasuggest that these liquidations have further to run," JP Morgansaid in a report. JP Morgan said latest data from the Commodity Futures TradingCommission show long positions in the Australian dollar and theand the Mexican peso have fallen by two-thirds but for theCanadian dollar by only half. Also, Japanese margin longs in theyen crosses were near all-time highs at the start of the week. All of which suggests the recent sell-off in growth-linkedcurrencies was likely to run further. Tensions on the Koreanpeninsula are also likely to keep traders away from theAustralian dollar  which is hugely leveraged to the Asiangrowth story. The Aussie dollar was steady at $0.8264, having earlierrallied from 10-month lows against the U.S. dollar. (Editing by Ed Davies)             ]]></raw>
