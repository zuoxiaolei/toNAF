<raw><![CDATA[   * Euro comes off highs vs dollar as caution sets in * Yen rises as risk-taking fades * Lingering doubts over European banks weigh on euro (Adds comments, details, changes byline, dateline, previousLONDON) By Vivianne Rodrigues NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - The euro edged up against thedollar on Monday but was below early highs as investorsspeculated European bank stress tests weren't strict enough tosupport a rally in the euro zone single currency. Demand for the yen rose as appetite for risk faded, withEuropean shares sliding and U.S. stock futures lower. Still,analysts said euro gains may not wane completely as recent datain the region had been supportive for the currency. "Despite the market's single-minded focus on the stresstests the more important story was the surprisingly strongeconomic data from the region (last week)," said BorisSchlossberg, a director for currency research at GFT in NewYork. Fear of a euro zone debt crisis and its impact on Europeanbanks drove the euro below $1.19 last month, its lowest levelsince 2006, but it began a swift recovery in July and hit a10-week high above $1.30 last week. That was partly driven by data showing the euro zoneeconomy has been holding up better than anticipated, even asgovernments tighten their belts to reign in large deficits. Relief over the results of the tests, which only seven of91 banks failed, helped push the euro 0.2 percent higheragainst the dollar at $1.2923. But the currency came off asession high of $1.2958. Technical analysts said the euro may still push towards$1.3125, the 38.2 percent retracement of the December to Junemove. To do that, however, it would need to sustain a moveabove $1.30, a level it has not retested since hitting a10-week high around $1.3028 early last week. The euro's downside was also seen limited while it remainedabove support at $1.2870 -- its 100-day moving average -- andlast week's low around $1.2730, leaving it hemmed in within arange for the time being. Some said the euro's gains could also be constrained bythis week's redemption of maturing euro zone bonds and couponpayments worth some 45 billion euros, according to Citiestimates. Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showedcurrency speculators cut net short positions in the euro. Netshorts fell to 24,251 contracts in the week to July 20 comparedwith 27,050 in the prior week. "The stress tests failed to inspire much of a euro/dollarrally but at the same time there is no reason for bears tostart selling the euro aggressively either," said RobertoMialich, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan. YEN GAINS The yen gained broadly as investors stepped back fromrisk-taking. The euro hit a seven-week high of 113.49 yen as dealersunwound long yen positions, but then ran into offers fromJapanese exporters around 113.30/50 yen. It was last down 0.2 percent at 112.64 yen, helping to pullthe dollar down 0.4 percent to 87.10 yen. The dollar was expected to remain under pressure afterrecent weak U.S. housing and manufacturing data. Economistshave steadily marked down forecasts for Friday's U.S. secondquarter gross domestic product numbers. The Australian dollar came off a fresh 10-week high of$0.8990, hit on interest rate differentials with the UnitedStates.
