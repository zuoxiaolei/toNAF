<raw><![CDATA[ * Hint in China central bank report viewed with skepticism * Obama held Bush to tough standard on currency * U.S. coalition wants more duties on Chinese goods By Doug Palmer WASHINGTON, Nov 11 (Reuters) - U.S. critics of China'scurrency policy said on Wednesday they were skeptical of a hintfrom Beijing that it could soon let its yuan rise against thedollar again after an 18-month hiatus. The critics, representing U.S. business and labor groups,also urged President Barack Obama to live up to his campaignpromise last year, when he said he would "insist that Chinastop manipulating its currency because it's not fair toAmerican manufacturers, it's not fair to you and we are goingto change it when I am president of the United States ofAmerica." (For a video of Obama's speech last year on China trade tothe Alliance for American Manufacturing, see:http://kdka.com/video/?id=40232@kdka.dayport.com) In its third-quarter monetary policy report, the People'sBank of China on Wednesday departed from well-worn language onkeeping the yuan  "basically stable at a reasonableand balanced level". For details, see [ID:nSP466424] The central bank hinted instead at a shift from aneffective dollar peg that has been in place since the middle oflast year. U.S. manufacturers complain that Beijing deliberately keepsits currency undervalued against the dollar to give itscompanies an unfair trade advantage that is reflected in thehuge U.S. trade deficit with the Asian manufacturing giant. Scott Paul, executive director of the Alliance for AmericanManufacturing, said he suspected the People's Bank of Chinareport was aimed at defusing tensions on the currency issuebefore Obama arrives next week in China for talks. "After many years of observing how China proceeds on this,I'm reluctant to give them much credit other than making ashrewd political move ahead of Obama's visit," Paul said. Lloyd Wood, a spokesman for the Fair Currency Coalition,said they would keep pushing for legislation that Obamasupported when he was a senator to give U.S. companies newtools to fight China's currency practices. "Our attitude is actions speak later than words. Until wesee some appreciable change (in China's exchange rate and hugetrade surplus with the United States), digging a deeper hole ata slower rate is not going to solve the problem," Wood said. OBAMA CALLED BUSH INACTION "UNACCEPTABLE" In an interview with Reuters earlier this week, Obama saidhe planned to bring up China's currency, "along with a host ofother issues," when he meets with Chinese leaders in Beijing. Despite his fiery campaign rhetoric, Obama has refused intwo Treasury Departments reports since taking office to brandChina as a currency manipulator, and when asked about that inthe interview he parried the question. [ID:nN09278455] "I think it is important as president of the United States,as we enter into these discussions, that we are looking at allthe issues involved and not just one," Obama said. But last year on the campaign trail, he held hispredecessor, George W. Bush, to a much tougher standard. "Each year they've had the chance, the Bush administrationhas failed to do anything about it and that's unacceptable.That's why I co-sponsored the Currency Exchange Rate OversightReform Act. And that's why as president I'll use all thediplomatic avenues open to me to insist that China stopmanipulating its currency," Obama said in the April 2008 speechto the Alliance for American Manufacturing. The bill Obama said he supported required the TreasuryDepartment to identify countries with "misaligned currencies,"and then allowed the Commerce Department to slap anti-dumpingduties on imports from those countries if the currencymisalignment was not corrected within 180 days. The legislation also called for the United States to file aWorld Trade Organization complaint against countries thatpersistently misalign their currency. Another bill Obama co-sponsored when he was in the Senatewould designate currency misalignment as a subsidy under U.S.trade laws to make it easier for companies to requestanti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese imports. The Fair Currency Coalition, which includes labor, steel,textile and other groups, continues to push for that bill andhas collected 75 co-sponsors in the House of Representativesand seven in the Senate so far this year. They want Obama to back the bill now as president. "China is incredibly dependent on exports to drive itseconomy and any potential disruption of those exports is goingto get China's attention. Until the Obama administration iswilling to use that leverage, China won't be under any realpressure to change its policy," Wood said.
