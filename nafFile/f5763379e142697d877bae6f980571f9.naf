<raw><![CDATA[   * Chinese subsidies shift into trade law limelight * WTO ruling unlikely to dent anti-subsidy action by EU, US  By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck and Michael Martina BRUSSELS/BEIJING, March 23 (Reuters) - A ruling by theworld's top trade court against a series of U.S. trade barriershas put the spotlight on Chinese subsidies and the ability oftrading nations to erect obstacles to cheap goods from China. The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling this monthdismayed U.S. policymakers and industry and has raised questionsabout European Union plans to challenge illegal Chinese statefinancing as well as export dumping. Here are some questions and answers about the likely impactof the WTO ruling on the EU's dual measures against China.  WHY ARE CHINESE SUBSIDIES SO TOPICAL? EU and U.S. producers from tile makers to car tyre producershave warned of shrinking market shares as financial crises makeconsumers opt for cheap Chinese goods, increasingly in high-techsectors thus far dominated by Western firms. Concerns China might be using state funds to push up thetechnology ladder rose with China's 12th five-year plan thismonth -- which made backing for high-tech industry a priority --and high-profile attempts by Chinese firms to buy stakes inhigh-tech EU and U.S. firms. Europe's trade chief said last year China subsidised "nearlyeverything" and has called on EU industry to help identifyillegal Chinese state aid. Last year, the EU executive vowed tofight subsidies wherever possible.  WHAT HAPPENED AT THE WTO THIS MONTH? The World Trade Organization's top court upheld Chineseobjections to dual anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties imposedby the United States on Chinese steel pipes, tires and wovensacks that Washington said were unfairly priced and subsidised. In particular, the appellate body supported China's argumentthat the imposition of such a double penalty broke WTO law. TheEU and United States regularly impose dual duties on foreignexporters, but China and Vietnam, which are not consideredmarket economies, are vulnerable to higher combined tariffs. Separately, the WTO ruling said contrary to the U.S. view,Chinese state-owned enterprises do not necessarily performgovernment functions that would render them capable of offeringstate subsidies, tax benefits or cheap loans. "China's (economic) model has been affirmed to a degreewithin the international community," said Tu Xinquan, aprofessor and trade expert at the University of InternationalBusiness and Economics in Beijing.  WHAT HAS BEEN THE REACTION TO THE RULING? U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said he was "deeplytroubled" by the report and criticised it for over reaching,while U.S. lawmakers warned it would slow trade liberalisation. A Chinese government statement hailed the report asestablishing "the United States acts unlawfully in the methodsby which it calculates and imposes countervailing duties." Trade lawyers and diplomats say the ruling may furtherembolden China to challenge trade barriers at the WTO.  WILL THIS END EU AND U.S. PLANS FOR ANTI-SUBSIDY DUTIES? That's unlikely. Trade lawyers in the EU and United Statessay they have enough legal instruments to keep challengingChinese export pricing and subsidies simultaneously if and whentheir domestic industries ask them to.  The EU, for instance, protects itself against Chinese legalchallenges with rules that force it to set import duties againstthe lowest impact level of illegal Chinese trade practices. It also focuses on domestic rather than export subsidies asa way to avoid allegations of imposing double penalties, and hastargeted some sector-specific subsidies and specific lendingpractices, which trade officials say is in line with WTO law. In the jargon-filled world of trade defence law, countriescan make easy tweaks to legislation to turn a trade barrierdeemed illegal by the WTO into a legal defence measure. A defiant EU Commission last week proposed dual anti-subsidyand anti-dumping duties against Chinese glossy paper, insistingits duties were safe from challenge. INSERT  WILL FIRMS KEEP ASKING FOR DUAL ACTION AGAINST CHINA? Western firms are likely to demand increasing action againstChinese subsidies as the number of anti-dumping measures falls. That is largely because in 2016 at the latest, China willautomatically enter the world club of market economies.  From then on, China will be able to defend itself moresuccessfully against allegations of market dumping, handinggreater power to subsidy complaints.
