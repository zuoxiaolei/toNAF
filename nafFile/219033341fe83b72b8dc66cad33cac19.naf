<raw><![CDATA[ By Daniel Bases PRINCETON, Sept. 23 (Reuters) - Turkish Prime MinisterTayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday he expects to presentParliament with documents to establish diplomatic ties withArmenia by early October, just before a critical meetingbetween the nations' two leaders. Erdogan, in a broad-ranging foreign policy speech beforefaculty and students at Princeton University said thenegotiations "have really taken us to an important position." Turkey and Armenia have no diplomatic ties and share ahistory of animosity stemming from the mass killing ofArmenians by Ottoman Turks during World War One. Turkey denies the 1915 killings amounted to genocide, buthas agreed to set up a commission of international experts onthe issue under the protocol it signed with Armenia. "If we don't see prejudice or some domestic politicalconsiderations at play, I believe the preparation for anagreement, which has been initialed between Turkey and Armeniacould be taken to Parliament to be ratified. We hope to takethose steps by the 10th or 11th of next month," Erdogan saidthrough a translator. Ankara has said it hopes to open its border with Armenia bythe end of the year under a protocol to establish diplomaticties. Anticipation over an Ankara-Yerevan thaw has been growingahead of a planned visit by Armenian President Serzh Sarksyanto Turkey on Oct. 14 when he is due to attend the return leg ofa World Cup qualifying soccer match between the two countries. Sarksyan has said he would not travel to the game, thefirst leg of which Turkish President Abdullah Gul watched lastyear in Yerevan, unless the border has reopened or there areclear signs it is about to open. Erdogan said he thought there should be no hesitation onthe part of Sarksyan to make the trip. "If the Turkish President can easily go to Armenia to watcha game then it should be just as easy and simple for theArmenian President" to come to Turkey, Erdogan said. "I think asking for certain conditions to be met to decideto come is not the right way forward in international politicsanymore," he said. Turkey is a key player in the region, and bills itself as abridge between the Christian west and the Muslim Middle East.While it is a secular society, Turkey's 70 million people arepredominantly Muslim. Erdogan reiterated its foreign policy is based upon havingzero problems with its neighbors. Progress on theseneighborhood issues would also enhance its ongoing process ofjoining the European Union.
