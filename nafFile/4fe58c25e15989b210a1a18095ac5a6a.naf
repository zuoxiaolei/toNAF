<raw><![CDATA[ * Tokyo, Asian shares fall sharply after Wall Street slide * Euro down nearly 1 percent vs yen to near 8-year low * NZ dollar falls to 9-month low vs U.S. dollar  (Releads, adds quotes, changes dateline prvs TOKYO) By Tamawa Desai LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday asconcern about the euro zone's banking system fanned strains inmoney markets, boosting demand for dollars across the board. Weighing on the euro was the Spanish central bank's takeoverof savings bank CajaSur on Saturday after a failed merger withanother regional lender. Although CajaSur is relatively small, analysts said thebailout highlighted weakness in the European banking sector andfanned fears that more banks may need to be bailed out by someeuro zone members that are already saddled with heavy debt. "Spanish banking fears certainly exacerbate contagionrisks," said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank ofTokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. In the money market, U.S. two-year swap spreads pushed outto their widest in two years, reflecting tightening fundingconditions. European shares fell 2.7 percent in early trade. Tokyo'sNikkei average hit its lowest in more than five months, whilethe MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 3.7percent. That came after Wall Street fell more than 1 percentovernight. By 0822 GMT, the euro fell 1.0 percent on the day againstthe dollar to a session low of $1.2230 and was last at $1.2231. The euro has lost more than 7 percent against the dollar sofar this month, heading for its biggest monthly fall sinceJanuary 2009. The euro's downside targets are a four-year low of $1.2143hit last week and $1.2133, a 50 percent retracement of a rallyfrom its all-time low around $0.8225 in October 2000 to itsrecord peak of $1.6040 touched in July 2008, traders said. If it falls below that level the next support would be thepsychologically important level of $1.2000, where many stops arebelieved to be set, they said. The euro fell 1.3 percent to 109.78 yen, nearing aneight-year low of 109.47 yen hit on trading platform EBS lastweek. Funding conditions for banks have also been tightening, withfirms in the United States increasingly reluctant to deal withfirms with large exposure to Europe, a move analysts sayreflects growing risk aversion. U.S. dollar 3-month Libor/OIS spreads were sharply wider onMonday, with the 3-month Libor hitting a 10-month high,indicating stressed conditions in the money market. The dollar index rose 1.0 percent to 87.11. The greenbackdipped 0.3 percent to 89.82 yen. In a generalised mood of risk aversion, growth-linkedcurrencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars alsosaw sharp pullbacks. The Australian dollar dropped more than 2.2 percent againstthe yen and more than 1.5 percent against the U.S. dollar ashedge funds and investors took profits on the higher-yieldingcurrency's rally this year. The New Zealand dollar fell to a nine-month low of $0.6610,down 1.2 percent on the day. Tensions in the Korean peninsula also buoyed the dollar andyen, after South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported NorthKorean leader Kim Jong-il had told his troops to get ready forcombat.
