<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was spotted slightly higher against the Japanese yen in Friday’s session ahead of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s meeting with President Obama later today. In Asian trading Friday, USD/JPY rose 0.14% to 93.25. The pair was likely to find support at 92.21, the low of February 15 and resistance at 94.45, the high of February 11 and a two-and-a-half year high. The talks between Abe and Obama are aimed at bolstering ties between the two countries and it is widely expected that the U.S. president will gently prod his Japanese counterpart about joining a trans-Asian trade partnership. Should that happen, some market participants see further upside for USD/JPY in the near-term. The yen has lost about 10% against the greenback since mid-December when Abe was elected prime minister. Meanwhile, the dollar gained strength against the yen following a report released earlier today by Societe Generale that said the yen is among three currencies that could be most hurt by a rising dollar and higher U.S. bond yields. The other two currencies highlighted in the report were the Australian dollar and the Mexican peso. Speaking of the Australian dollar, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens said that previous comments made by one of his underlings regarding Japan intentionally weakening the yen do not reflect RBA’s overall views on the matter. Earlier this week, RBA board member Heather Ridout made harsh comments about Japan devaluing the yen. Japan is Australia’s second-largest trading partner after China. Last weekend, Japan avoided censure by the G20 for the tumbling yen after agreeing that its leaders would not make public comments aimed at forcing the currency lower. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY rose 0.28% to 123.16 while AUD/JPY soared 0.79% to 96.19. GBP/JPY is higher by 0.19% at 142.30.             ]]></raw>
