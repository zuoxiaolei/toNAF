<raw><![CDATA[   * U.S. mid-Atlantic factory, producer price data disappoint * Strong JPMorgan results overshadowed by double-dip fears * Dollar down broadly on economic data; down 1 pct vs yen (Updates with U.S. markets, changes byline, dateline, previousLONDON) By Jennifer Ablan and Natsuko Waki NEW YORK/LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) - World stocks droppedon Thursday as disappointing U.S. economic data overshadowedstrong earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co. , while thedollar extended losses, shedding 1 percent against the yen. Among the weak reports, U.S. industrial production eked outa small gain in June and producer prices fell for a thirdmonth, providing more evidence of sluggish economic growth. Growth in factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic regionfell sharply. Economists had expected a rise. Investors have been faced all week with strong earnings butdata showing the recovery losing steam, which revived fears theeconomy could tip into a double-dip recession. "Death, destruction, story at six. Come on, what more do weneed to know here? Double-dip is here, there is no doubt aboutit," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Tradingin Chatham, New Jersey. Other data showed slowing growth in New York-areamanufacturing activity. But new U.S. weekly claims for joblessbenefits fell to their lowest level in nearly two years. Major equity indexes were down on the largely negativeeconomic figures. The Dow Jones industrial average  wasdown 108.75 points, or 1.05 percent, at 10,257.97. The Standard& Poor's 500 Index  was down 11.89 points, or 1.09percent, at 1,083.28, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  was down 25.35 points, or 1.13 percent, at 2,224.50.  MSCI world equity index  moved in sympathywith the U.S. market's open, dropping 2.11 percent. The ThomsonReuters global stock index  was also down 0.78percent. Strong earnings from JPMorgan Chase, the second-biggestU.S. bank by assets, weren't enough to offset the economicdata. JPMorgan's earnings jumped to $4.8 billion from $2.7billion as loan loss reserves declined, setting the bar highfor other big banks soon to produce results. In currencies, the dollar was down against a basket ofmajor trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index down 1 percent at 82.55 from a previous session close of83.426. The dollar hit a two-month low against the euro  anda basket of major currencies moved in sympathy with U.S.equities on soft inflation and manufacturing data. Figures showing a third straight monthly decline inproducer prices came a day after minutes from a Federal Reservepolicy meeting showed some policymakers think they may need todo more to boost the economy if a sputtering recovery slows anyfurther. That helped the euro rally to just shy of $1.29 for thefirst time since May. Debt trouble in the euro zone had pushedit below $1.19 last month, but fairly smooth bond auctions inGreece, Portugal and Spain have since eased concern. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 1.29percent at 87.30 from a previous session close of 88.440. CHINA STOCKS FALL AFTER DEBUT China's key stock index ended 1.9 percent lower, itsbiggest fall in two weeks, as Agricultural Bank of Chinadisappointed with a lackluster Shanghai debut. AgBank, the mostactive stock, ended up 0.8 percent at 2.7 yuan compared withits IPO price of 2.68 yuan. Earlier data showed China's economic growth moderated to10.3 percent in the second quarter from 11.9 percent in thefirst quarter, slightly below forecasts of 10.5 percentgrowth. All told, Treasuries were one of the biggest beneficiarieson Thursday. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 15/32, with the yield at 2.9955 percent. The2-year U.S. Treasury note  was up 1/32, with theyield at 0.59 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was up 34/32, with the yield at 3.98 percent.U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell $1.32, or 1.71percent, to  $75.72 per barrel, and spot gold prices fell 75 cents, or 0.06 percent, to $1,206.70. But theReuters/Jefferies CRB Index  was up 0.21 point, or 0.08percent, at 262.41. (Editing by Kenneth Barry)             ]]></raw>
