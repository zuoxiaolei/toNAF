<raw><![CDATA[ * Swiss franc soars on safe-haven demand * Dollar rebounds vs yen as data bolsters recovery hopes * Australian dollar climbs to 28-year high (Updates prices, adds comment, details) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc hit recordhighs against the euro and dollar on Thursday and looked set toextend gains in the new year as investors sought safety amidpersistent concerns about the euro zone debt crisis. The dollar rebounded from a seven-week low against the yenafter a string of strong-than-expected data bolstered optimismabout the U.S. economy and lifted U.S. bond yields. Higheryields make dollar-denominated assets more attractive. The euro fell as low as 1.2398 Swiss francs on tradingplatform EBS and was on track to post a record loss of about 16percent this year. The U.S. dollar is heading for a declineagainst the Swiss franc this year of about 10 percent. "Euro/Swiss franc has dropped to a new low in tandem withdollar/franc highlighting the genuine strength of the Swissfranc as opposed to simply weakness in either the dollar oreuro," said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at ScotiaCapital in Toronto. "We continue to be Swiss franc bulls, expecting that itsstatus as a European alternative to the euro, a strongsovereign position and relatively solid fundamentals willcontinue to (make) it an attractive home for investors," shesaid. In midday trading, the euro fell 0.6 percent to 1.2435francs. The dollar dropped 0.9 percent to 0.9376 francs, afterhaving hit a session trough of 0.9365 on EBS. Swiss implied volatilities ticked higher with the one-monthdollar/Swiss franc trading at around 11.80 percent, a levellast seen in mid-November. Against the U.S. dollar, the euro climbed to a session peakof $1.3315 on EBS after breaking above its 20-day movingaverage around $1.3222. It last traded at $1.3261, up 0.3percent on the day. Worries that the euro zone debt crisis may spread to Spainand Portugal have many analysts bracing for more euro weaknessin early 2011, but the currency's stubborn refusal to breakbelow the 200-day moving average -- now at $1.3086 -- hasfrustrated bearish investors. STRONGER US DATA The dollar earlier slipped as low as 81.28 yen on EBS --its lowest in seven weeks -- edging closer to a 15-year low of80.21 yen hit in November, after a surprisingly strong Treasuryauction on Wednesday put pressure on U.S. bond yields.     Butit recovered to last trade 0.2 percent higher at 81.76 yenafter data showed U.S. initial jobless claims hit their lowestlevel in more than two years last week and factory activity inthe Midwest grew in December at its fast pace since 1988. In a third report, the National Association of Realtorssaid pending home sales rose 3.5 percent last month, the secondstraight month of gains and beating market expectations for a 2percent increase. "The major theme is that the U.S. data keeps coming inbetter than expected," said Mark McCormick, currency strategistat Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. "It all fits with themethat the U.S. economy is moving in the right direction, andthat is going to be supportive of the dollar and higher bondyields in 2011." Thinning liquidity ahead of the New Year's holiday likelyexaggerated price swings and analysts cautioned against readingtoo much into the price action. In earlier trading, the Australian dollar hit a fresh28-year high of $1.0198 against the U.S. dollar, though optionbarriers at $1.0200 prevented further gains as it eased back to$1.0113.             ]]></raw>
