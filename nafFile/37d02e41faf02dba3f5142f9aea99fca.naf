<raw><![CDATA[ * APEC draft says economies not yet on stable footing * Group economies to keep stimulus plans for durablerecovery * Finance ministers say no rush to fiscal tightening * Draft calls for extra commitment to 2010 Doha trade deal By Nopporn Wong-Anan SINGAPORE, Nov 2 (Reuters) - APEC countries, including theUnited States, Japan and China, will keep up stimulus policiesand push for a global trade deal next year as they seek to spura lasting economic recovery, according to draft statements fromthe group seen by Reuters on Monday. "We will maintain our economic stimulus policies until adurable economic recovery is secured," said a draft statementby the 21-member group's leaders, dated Oct. 31 and expected tobe delivered after an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)summit in Singapore on Nov. 15. World stocks slid on Monday to hug one-month lows, asinvestors fretted about the pace of an economic recovery andprepared for the eventual withdrawal of stimulative monetarypolicy. Finance ministers from the APEC group said in a separatestatement that there was no need to rush fiscal tightening,especially as credit markets were still recovering. "Careful planning and timing withdrawal of extraordinarystimulus measures will help to avoid a double-dip recession,"said the finance ministers in the draft seen by Reuters. Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20will next gather on Friday to discuss progress in restoringglobal growth after the worst financial crisis in decades. Analysts said APEC's draft statements were consistent withcomments by policymakers in recent months and reflected thesentiment of investors. "They are very afraid -- they don't want to withdrawstimulus plans prematurely," said economist David Cohen ofconsultancy Action Economics in Singapore. Leaders of the 21 APEC economies said robust policyresponses have helped set the stage for recovery, whilerejection of protectionism has kept markets and trade openacross the region. However, multi-billion dollar stimulus packages by APECgovernments have included "buy local" campaigns that have ledto accusations of protectionism and trade spats. FLEXIBLE FOR DOHA DEAL APEC's leaders were concerned at the lack of substantiveprogress on concluding the round of world trade talks launchedin Doha in 2001 and called for a deal next year, their draftstatement said. It said APEC was "ready to exercise all possibleflexibility in order to accelerate the pace in negotiations". "We instruct our ministers to work closely with theDirector-General (of the World Trade Organisation) to evaluate,in specific terms, what needs to be done to conclude the DohaDevelopment Agenda in 2010," said the draft. WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said last month the goalof signing a new global commerce deal in 2010 was out of reachunless countries accelerated their negotiations. Lamy said the WTO's 153 members must turn vague discussionson the Doha round into real negotiations with concreteproposals laid down on paper. On environment and energy, APEC emphasised a 2007declaration of an aspirational target to reduce energyintensity in the region by at least 25 percent by 2030, whilepledging commitment to a "good agreement" at global climatetalks next month. "We believe that global emissions will need to peak overthe next few years, and be reduced to 50 percent below 1990levels by 2050," said the draft by leaders of APEC, whichincludes some of the world's top polluting nations. APEC has 21 member economies: Australia, Brunei, Canada,Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru,Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, United Statesand Vietnam.
