<raw><![CDATA[ (refiles to remove garble in paragraph 15) * Coalition partner compromises on call for larger spending * Will issue more than Y100 bln debt for stimulus -finmin * Includes extension of subsidies on energy-efficient cars * Default swaps, other markets show muted reaction for now * Tax revenue shortfall to reach Y9 trln - finmin By Tetsushi Kajimoto TOKYO, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Japan's government agreed on a $81billion stimulus package on Tuesday, aimed at preventing theeconomy from tipping back into recession as deflation persistsand a strong yen threatens exports. Economists said the 7.2 trillion yen plan, equal to about 1.5percent of gross domestic product, would not provide asignificant lift to an economy dependent on overseas demand formachinery, electronics and cars. While several other economies are already debating phasingout economic stimulus deployed to fight the financial crisis,Japan continues to struggle amid chronically weak consumer demandand falling prices. The budget underscores the balancing act faced by PrimeMinister Yukio Hatoyama and his Democratic Party. The Democratsare keen to avoid a recession ahead of an upper-house electionnext year but are also under pressure to make good on theirpledge of fiscal discipline as the country's public debt nears200 percent of GDP, by far the worst among G7 nations. "This may help the economy somewhat," said Yasunari Ueno,chief market economist at Mizuho Securities. "But it doesn't evenbegin to address the more fundamental issues facing Japan, suchas weaknesses in the global economy and deflation." Japan pulled out of recession in April-June thanks to arecovery in exports but figures due on Wednesday are expected toshow third-quarter growth was much slower than an initialestimate. Growth is seen slowing further in the first half of next yearas the effect of nearly 27 trillion yen stimulus agreed by theprevious Liberal Democratic Party government, wears off. The new package, earmarked for low-interest mortgages for newhome buyers, incentives for users of "green" technologies andextended subsidies for energy-efficient cars and householdappliances, aims to encourage reluctant Japanese consumers tospend more. Analysts, however, were sceptical about the plan's impact andwhile most expect Japan to avoid a double-dip recession, thosewho predict another slump were not swayed by the latest spendingplan. "This stimulus will have a limited impact on the economy. Idon't think we need a major change in our forecast," said HidekiMatsumura, a senior economist at Japan Research Institute, whoexpects a contraction in both the first and second quarter. "I would be surprised if the contribution to growth exceeded0.5 percentage point," said Simon Wong, regional economist atStandard Chartered in Hong Kong. TAX HOLE, SUPPLY WORRIES Financial markets showed a muted reaction to the package thatwill be mostly funded with contingency funds and money redirectedfrom what the Democrats described as wasteful spending in anearlier plan drawn up by the LDP. The Democrats have pledged to fund their policies without anyextra borrowing, but Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said the newpackage will require issuing more than 100 billion yen in newbonds. While that would add only marginally to overall debt supply,Fujii also said an expected shortfall in tax revenues of morethan 9 trillion yen would drive this fiscal year's new debtsupply to around 53 trillion yen, up 20 percent from the initialestimate. Five-year credit default swaps on Japan's sovereign debt werequoted at 60/67 basis points on Tuesday, down from just above 70basis points a week ago, a trader at a Japanese securities housesaid. That is much lower than a record high of 130 bps set lastFebruary at the tail end of the global financial crisis whenpolitical uncertainty and worries about Japan's fiscal positiondrove up the cost of insurance against Japan defaulting on itsdebt. That means concern over debt supply will keep investors onedge. Japan's five- to 20-year yield curve hit its steepest levelin seven years on Tuesday with long bonds taking a hit from apoor 30-year auction. "The biggest focus now is whether the government will be ableto keep bond issuance below 50 trillion yen next fiscal year andwhether it will be able to map out growth strategies," saidAkiyoshi Takumori, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui AssetManagement.

"It's not good if we stick too much to the 44 trillion yengoal and it hurts people's livelihoods. But I would like to keepit as our objective," he told a news conference. The work on the package, originally due to be completed onFriday, got delayed when the ruling party was forced to add 100billion yen in spending to appease a small coalition partner, ledby outspoken banking minister Shizuka Kamei. The Democrats needtheir junior partners' support to enact legislation smoothly. Analysts said Hatoyama, whose popularity ratings have beeneroded by doubts about his leadership ability, had survived thespat with minimal damage, making only a small concession tocoalition partner. "I understand that Mr. Kamei is saying this is a three-partycoalition, but this is the Hatoyama government," NationalStrategy Minister Naoto Kan told reporters.
