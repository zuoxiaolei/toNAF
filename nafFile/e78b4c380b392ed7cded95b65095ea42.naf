<raw><![CDATA[ * Business morale falls, ending 9 months of gains * Euro climbs after data shows dip less than expected * Broad picture of continuing strong economic recovery   By Brian Rohan BERLIN, March 25 (Reuters) - German business confidenceeased only slightly in March, although the prospect of higherinterest rates and concern over the impact of Japan's earthquakehas given firms pause for thought, a survey showed on Friday. The closely-watched report by Munich's Ifo think tank onFriday showed its business climate index, based on a monthlysurvey of some 7,000 firms, inched down to 111.1, compared witha forecast in a Reuters poll for a drop to 110.5. The euro ticked up in response as investors read the surveyas showing Germany's economic upturn was continuing unabated,adding to the case for a first rise in euro zone interest ratesthat may come as early as next month. Ifo said the survey's results were dented by itsforward-looking expectations component and the fact that half ofthe survey's responses came in after the disaster at Japan'sFukushima nuclear plant began to unfold. Analysts said there may be some worries about orders to andfrom Japan in the near-term, although sales there are only atiny proportion of German exports and the concern was likelychiefly about the broad impact on the global economy.  Ifo's expectations index fell to 106.5 from 107.9 inFebruary. "The relatively slight fall is noticeably linked to Japanand other uncertainty factors such as the situation in NorthAfrica or the Middle East," Ifo economist Klaus Abberger said. "Japan will not have a lasting effect on the world economy.Some companies have been affected and some supply chains havebroken down. But the global economy will not take an entirelydifferent course because of it."^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Graphic on Ifo vs GDP growth: http://r.reuters.com/nec78r^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  RATE RISE Germany has recovered faster than expected from a recessionin 2009 that was its deepest since World War Two, and by thefourth quarter of last year its economy was growing by 4 percentyear-on-year. That growth is at the heart of the case for a rise inEuropean Central Bank rates which would come at a time whenother euro zone member economies are struggling with a sovereigndebt crisis and slashing public spending in response. The prospect of a rise in the cost of companies' borrowingfed into the slight worsening of sentiment, but Ifo economistKlaus Abberger said German companies are well-placed to copewith both higher rates and a higher oil price.  "The shocks in Japan, North Africa/Mideast and the eurocrisis -- have been largely psychological," said Citigroupeconomist Juergen Michels. "The real effects on the Germaneconomy appear to be limited so far." Other data showed that lending to consumers and companies inthe euro zone picked up speed in February, with businessborrowing up 16 billion euros on the month. Germany's trade figures for January registered a slighthiccup in exports but they also showed appetite for goods fromabroad grew more than expected, suggesting strong domesticdemand. Domestic demand also fuelled a stronger-than-expected risein German industrial orders in January, and output bounced back from a plunge caused by icy winter weather late last year. "Today's Ifo marginal drop is no reason to get petrified,"said ING's Carsten Brzeski. "The economy is slipping on oil butis not tumbling. The fundamentals of the German economy arestrong enough to withstand some setbacks."  (Additional reporting by Stephen Brown and Erik Kirschbaum;editing by Patrick Graham)             ]]></raw>
