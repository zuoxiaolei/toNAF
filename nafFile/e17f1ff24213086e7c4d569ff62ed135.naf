<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro takes a hit as Europe banking concerns rekindled * Yen, Swiss franc rally on growing risk aversion * Aussie hits day's low after PM secures minority govt (Adds comment, updates throughout; previous TOKYO)  By Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Tuesdayafter rekindled concerns about the European banking sector andprompted investors to sell higher-risk currencies. Investors were focused on an announcement by Germany'sbanking association that the country's 10 biggest banks may need105 billion euros of additional capital under revamped rules. The yen and the Swiss franc rallied, supported by theirsafe-haven appeal after a Wall Street Journal reporthighlighting the shortcomings of European bank stress testsearlier this year also helped spur risk aversion. The German association announcement had limited impact whwnit was released on Monday as market volume was thin due to aU.S. market holiday. "For the moment, the news about the German banks and thestress tests will weigh on risk appetite," said Sven Schubert,currency analyst at Credit Suisse in Zurich. "But concerns about the tests were already known, so theimpact may be short-lived." He expected investors to pick up euros under $1.28, and thatthe single currency may drift towards $1.30 in the near term. By 0753 GMT, the euro had fallen half a percent on the dayto $1.2797 after touching a session low around $1.2780. Itretreated from $1.2920 hit on Monday, its highest in nearlythree weeks. Further losses in the euro were limited due to broad demandfor euros below $1.28, with traders saying central banks werepicking up the single currency at the day's low. The euro's losses helped prod the dollar 0.4 percent higherversus a currency basket to 82.372, recovering from a slide toits weakest in more than three weeks on Monday. Against the yen, the single currency fell roughly 1 percenton the day to 107.30 yen, edging towards a nine-year low of105.44 yen hit in August. The Japanese currency rallied across the board, pushing thedollar down 0.4 percent to 83.72 yen, near a 15-year trough of83.58 yen touched last month. The yen hit the day's high after Bank of Japan GovernorMasaaki Shirakawa said monetary authorities could not controlforex rates, increasing speculation Japan may not be preparingto act to stem yen strength at the moment. "(Shirakawa) has essentially ruled out intervention in thenear term," CitiFXWire analysts said in a client note addingthat the statement helped to encourage yen bulls. Shirakawa's comments followed the BOJ's decision earlier inthe day to hold off from additional monetary policy easing,while setting the stage for more economic stimulus next month.  AUSSIE SLIDES The market's focus on risk aversion also boosted the Swissfranc, pushing the euro 0.8 percent lower to 1.2930 francs. Thedollar was down 0.2 percent at 1.0098 francs. The Australian dollar dipped 0.6 percent on the day to asession trough of $0.9115, having slipped from a four-week highof $0.9181 hit on Monday. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard securing a minoritygovernment after weeks of political uncertainty initiallyprompted some buying in the Australian currency. But those gains were fleeting and the Aussie hit the day'slow on speculation the new government would press ahead with anew mining tax.  The Reserve Bank of Australia kept rates at 4.5 percent asexpected on Tuesday. While the central bank was generally upbeaton the Australian economy, it mentioned some uncertainty aboutoverseas.
