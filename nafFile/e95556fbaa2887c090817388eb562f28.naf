<raw><![CDATA[ * Dec core CPI falls 1.3 pct yr/yr, smaller drop than in Nov * Index stripping out energy costs falls faster * Industrial output rises on firm exports to Asia (Adds details, background) By Stanley White and Tetsushi Kajimoto TOKYO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices fellfrom a year earlier for the 10th straight month in December,meaning the government will likely keep pushing the Bank of Japanto ease monetary policy more. The pace of decline slowed from November as the effect of oilprice falls faded, while factory output continued to rise on theback of solid demand for Japanese goods in Asia. But the so-called "core-core" consumer price index, whichstrips out the effect of energy costs, fell at a faster pace inDecember in a sign of anemic demand. That will worry policymakerswho fear a return to recession ahead of elections in the summer. "The pace of decline in the core-core CPI accelerated and weshould take this to mean that deflation remains a problem," saidYasuo Yamamoto, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. "The BOJ needs to continue its easy monetary policy. For thegovernment's part, they may need to consider another stimuluspackage, as the economy is stagnating." But Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's government has littleroom to boost spending further as the national debt is now almosttwice as big as the country's annual gross domestic product.Credit ratings agency Standard and Poor's this week warned thatit may cut the country's rating. Parliament will soon debate the government's record budgetfor the year starting in April and the threat of a credit ratingsdowngrade by Standard and Poor's means The core CPI, which includes oil products but excludesvolatile prices of fresh fruit, vegetables and seafood, fell 1.3percent in December from a year earlier, matching marketforecasts. It was smaller than a 1.7 percent drop in November. The so-called core-core inflation index, similar to the coreindex used in the United States, fell 1.2 percent in Decemberfrom a year earlier after a 1.0 percent drop in November. Industrial output rose 2.2 percent in December asmanufacturers continued to benefit from a strong economicrecovery in Asia, although the increase was smaller than the 2.5percent forecast by economists. The BOJ forecast on Tuesday prices would fall less thanearlier thought but remained open to further policy easing in theface of renewed government calls for more support for a fragileeconomic recovery. The central bank, under pressure from the government, hastoughened its stance on deflation and in early December decidedto offer commercial banks more short-term funds. The government and BOJ agree stimulating demand is essentialto conquering deflation, but the BOJ has already committed tokeeping rates at a very low level and the government's supportfor households could take a long time to have an impact.             ]]></raw>
