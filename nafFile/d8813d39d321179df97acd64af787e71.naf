<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com – The U.S. dollar was mixed against other major currencies on Tuesday, amid persisting fears over Greece's debt crisis and after comments by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank president on interest rates.  During European morning trade, the greenback was up against the euro and pound, with EUR/USD slipping 0.24% to hit 1.3527 and GBP/USD shedding 0.33% to hit 1.4941.  It also rose against the Swiss franc and the kiwi, with USD/CHF gaining 0.27% to hit 1.0822 and NZD/USD falling 0.36% to reach 0.6972.  But the greenback was down against the yen and its Canadian and Australian counterparts: USD/JPY shed 0.05% to reach 89.09, USD/CAD dropped 0.53% to hit 1.0359 and AUD/USD rose 0.01% to hit 0.9011.  The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.14%.  On Monday, Charles Plosser, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank president, told the Wall Street Journal in an interview that the U.S. economy was "in the early stages of a recovery."  In reference to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's pledge to keep interest rates low for an "extended period," Plosser was quoted as saying: “I would rather have language that is more conditional on the state of the economy, and less upon some arbitrary time frame." Plosser's comments were reported as the European Union called on Greece to agree to further austerity measures within days in order to tackle its fiscal crisis.             ]]></raw>
