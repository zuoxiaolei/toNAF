<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The euro edged higher against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, but remained within striking distance of Monday’s 10-week low amid fears that the region’s sovereign debt crisis could spread to Spain or Italy. EUR/USD hit 1.4081 during late Asian trade, the daily high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4054, easing up 0.05%.The pair was likely to find short-term support at 1.3968, Monday’s low and a 10-wek low and resistance at 1.4144, Monday’s high.Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Italy to negative from stable on Saturday, while the weekend defeat of Spain's ruling socialists in local elections raised worries about the country’s ability to meet fiscal targets.Meanwhile, ongoing speculation over some kind of debt restructuring for Greece has weighed on the single currency, amid a lack of consensus among European policy makers, with many opposed to the idea of debt restructuring.The euro was up against the pound, with EUR/GBP rising 0.22% to hit 0.8733.On Monday, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the Fed would hold interest rates at record low levels after the second round of quantitative easing ended in June to provide more time to evaluate the strength of the U.S. economy.Bullard also said the U.S. economy faces potential headwinds if ongoing fears about the future of the euro create "prolonged" market turmoil.             ]]></raw>
