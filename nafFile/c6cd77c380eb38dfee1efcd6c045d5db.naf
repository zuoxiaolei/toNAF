<raw><![CDATA[ * Pfizer deal with Biocon spooks Novo investors * Increased threat of cheap competition in insulin market * But hurdles remain, including developing delivery devices * Shares down around 10 percent in less than two days  By Anna Ringstrom and Ben Hirschler COPENHAGEN/LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Fears of cut-pricecompetition in the insulin market sent shares in Novo Nordiskskidding again on Tuesday, lopping some 10 percent off theDanish drugmaker's market value in less than two days. The threat from so-called biosimilar insulins has beencrystallised by Pfizer's agreement to sell versions of insulindeveloped by India's Biocon. Piper Jaffray senior analyst Sam Fazeli said the news was asudden reminder of the likelihood of generic insulin competitionin a few years' time and shares in Novo -- the European drugsector's star performer this year -- could drop even more. "The real risk from generic insulin is far out, but Novo'svaluation was so high it was vulnerable," he said. "They are taking a hit because they are the most expensivepharma company in the world. In order to have that kind ofvaluation, you need to have a business that is bullet-proof." Fazeli, who has a neutral stance on Novo's shares with aprice target of 495 crowns, added that if Biocon had made a dealwith any drugmaker other than the world's biggest "maybe peoplewouldn't have been so worried". The Danish drugmaker, the world's biggest supplier ofinsulin, has been on a roll since mid-2009 on hopes for its newdiabetes drug Victoza and confidence in its insulin franchise. Expanding waistlines globally have fuelled an epidemic oftype-2 diabetes that has boosted demand for its products.  PFIZER AMBITIONS The looming challenge from Pfizer is a blow but arguably nogreat surprise, given the U.S. company's stated ambitions tobecome a major player in biopharmaceuticals. Novo spokesman Mike Rulis said his company expected genericcompetition after patents for its modern insulins expired. "Nothing in this has changed the playing field. We believeboth our existing products and, not the least, our upcoming newproducts will remain very competitive," he said. Biosimilars -- copies of complex biotech drugs that arecomparable, though not identical, to the original product -- arealso a long-term threat for other companies making biologicalmedicines, like Roche and Amgen. Sanford Bernstein analyst Jack Scannell said that withbiosimilar insulins still at the development stage, theirsuccess was not guaranteed -- but he noted that the deal betweenPfizer and Biocon was the first of its kind. "Pfizer said they may be ready for launch in Europe in 2012,and possibly 2015 in the U.S., but Novo sales could be affectedin developing markets where Biocon already sells biosimilardrugs in the relatively near term," Scannell said. "But I do think it will be tough commercially, and a longand hard battle to really take on Novo in its major markets." Some investors have decided to cash in face of the Pfizerthreat. Novo shares shed 4.2 percent to 489.70 crowns at 1445GMT, after a 5.1 percent tumble on Monday, while the STOXX 600European healthcare index fell 1 percent. Novo remains very expensive, trading at around 21 timesexpected 2010 earnings based on consensus forecasts, or roughlydouble the European pharmaceuticals sector average.  DELIVERY DEVICE One key hurdle that any biosimilar manufacturer will have toovercome is making a competitive delivery device. Novo's peninjection systems have proved popular with patients and may behard to replace. Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Race said the Pfizer/Biocon dealwas unlikely to impact earnings between 2010 and 2014 and theshares should stabilise. But they may remain weak ahead of an Oct. 22 U.S. regulatorydecision on Eli Lilly and Amylin's experimental diabetes drugBydureon, a rival to Novo's Victoza, he added.
