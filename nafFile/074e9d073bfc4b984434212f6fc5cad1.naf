<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar/yen jumps nearly 1%, traders suspect intervention * Euro bounces back after early dip * Major Japanese banks buying dollar/yen TOKYO, Sept 24 (Reuters) - The dollar jumped nearly 1 percentagainst the yen on Friday as traders cited talk that Japaneseauthorities have intervened in the market to stem the yen'screeping gains in the past few days. The dollar's jump came after it had fallen to 84.26 yen onThursday, its lowest level since Japan intervened last week, andtraders said major Japanese banks were bidding up the dollar. Japanese officials have stayed mum on whether they haveintervened. Top currency diplomat Rintaro Tamaki declined tocomment on market speculation, Jiji news agency reported. TheBank of Japan also said it had no comment. The dollar rose to as high as 85.40 yen, rising more than 1yen from day's low of 84.34 yen. Some traders have speculated that an apparent lack ofcomplaint by President Barack Obama on last week's currencyintervention by Japan was seen as tacit approval by Washington ofJapan's action. Obama, who urged Chinese premier Wen Jiabao to take moreaction on the yuan on Thursday, did not mention currencies whenhe met with Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan, Kyodo news agencyreported. "The dollar could rise to above 85.50 but I doubt it willrise to around 86 yen as it has failed to hit that level whenJapan last intervened," said a trader at a Japanese brokeragehouse. Japan intervened on Sept. 15 minutes after the dollar hit a15-year low of 82.87 yen, selling an estimated 2 trillion yen($23.70 billion) in Japan's largest single-day yen sellingintervention. In the wake of that intervention, the dollar rose to as highas 85.94 yen. Some traders also said a rumour that Bank of Japan GovernorMasaaki Shirakawa might resign was also helping the dollar. Shirakawa is seen by some market players as less aggressiveabout monetary easing than Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernankeand thus his departure could herald more aggressive attempts bythe BOJ to easy monetary policy and cheapen the yen. The greenback has been under pressure due to shrinking yieldgaps between the dollar and the yen. The two-year bond yield spread fell to around 29 basispoints, the lowest in nearly two years, as expectations that theFederal Reserve will adopt quantitative easing brought U.S. bondyields closer to Japanese yields. As the dollar broadly weakened, the euro edged up about 0.1percent to $1.3330, ticking closer to a five-month high of$1.3441 struck on Wednesday. It fell briefly on mounting worries over Ireland, but supportat around $1.3280 proved solid.
