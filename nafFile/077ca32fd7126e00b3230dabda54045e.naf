While this was down from the previous month final reading of 98.1, it was the second highest level since January 2007.The mostly upbeat numbers came after stronger-than-forecast data on U.S. durable goods orders on Thursday, which added to indications that the economic recovery is on track.Earlier in the week, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said that if the economy keeps improving as the bank expects it will modify its forward guidance, but emphasized that a modification of its language should not be read as indicating that a rate hike would automatically happen within a number of meetings.Meanwhile, in China, official data released over the weekend showed that activity in the country's factory sector contracted for a second straight month in February.China's manufacturing purchasing managers' index released Sunday rose to 49.9 in February, just above expectations for a reading of 49.7 and up slightly from a two-year low of 49.8 in January.On Saturday, the People's Bank of China cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 5.35%. It was the second rate cut in less than four months, indicating that Beijing is becoming more aggressive in supporting the economy as its momentum slows and deflation risks rise.The Asian nation is Australia's largest trade partner.In the week ahead investors will be focusing on the outcome of a policy meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday, which is to be followed by the U.S. jobs report for February on Friday.Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of significant events likely to affect the markets.Monday, March 2Australia is to release a report on company operating profits.China is to publish the revised reading of the HSBC manufacturing index.In the U.S., the Institute of Supply Management is to report on manufacturing activity.Tuesday, March 3The Reserve Bank of Australia is to announce its benchmark interest rate and publish its rate statement, which outlines economic conditions and the factors affecting the monetary policy decision.Australia is also to release reports on building approvals and the current account.Wednesday, March 4Australia is to release data on fourth quarter GDP growth.China is to publish the HSBC services index.The U.S. is to release the ADP non-farm payrolls report, while looks at private sector jobs growth.
