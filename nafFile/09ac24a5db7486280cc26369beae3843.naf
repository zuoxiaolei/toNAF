<raw><![CDATA[ * Q2 growth revised up to faster-than-expected 2.6 pct * Fiscal stimulus boosts expansion, slowdown expected * Gov't to step up spending in Q3 * Rates seen on hold for rest of year (Adds government advancing fiscal spending) By Seo Eun-kyung SEOUL, Sept 3 (Reuters) - South Korea's economy grew fasterthan expected in the second quarter but much of it was due tostimulus spending and the central bank is likely to remaincautious about raising rates anytime soon. Underlining officials' concerns over the strength of therecovery, the government announced it was releasing early $9billion of fiscal stimulus spending originally earmarked forthe last three months of the year. "The second-quarter growth is quite impressive but therecovery is still nascent," said Park Sang-hyun, an economistat HI Investment & Securities. Speaking after data showed second-quarter growth wasrevised up to 2.6 percent from 2.3 percent, a central bankofficial said the economy was still expected to contract 1.6percent in 2009 as predicted in July. "We don't see a reason to change our yearly growth forecastfor now given the economic conditions in recent months," JungYung-taek, head of the national income team at the Bank ofKorea, told reporters. Most analysts predict the central bank will startincreasing rates from a record low of 2.0 percent in the firstquarter of 2010, although some expect it could come as early asNovember, according to the latest Reuters poll. Central bank governor Lee Seong-tae said last month hewould not consider any rate change until seeing third quarterGDP data, which will be available for November's monthly ratemeeting. "The central bank would likely consider raising rates ifthe third quarter sees sustainable growth more than 1.5percent. But the July industrial output and August exportfigures suggest some weakness," said Park at HI Investment &Securities. Industrial output posted its first annual rise in 10 monthsin July, but in a sign of weakness corporate investment andconsumer goods sales fell from June. Exports dropped at adouble digit pace last month from a year earlier while exportvalue per working day fell for a second month. The government has said third quarter growth would slow toaround 1 percent as the effect of fiscal stimulus fades. STIMULUS EFFECT Asia'a fourth largest economy grew its biggest in 5-Â½  years between April and June, up a seasonally adjusted 2.6percent from the previous quarter and following a revised 0.1percent gain in the first quarter and a 5.1 percent contractionin the last quarter of 2008, central bank data showed. For a graphic on GDP see http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/099/KR_GDPCB0909.gif Private consumption rose a seasonally adjusted 3.6 percentfrom the previous quarter, accelerating from just 0.4 percentgain in the first quarter. Corporate investment reversed its trend with 10.1 percentgrowth from a 11.2 percent decline. The government did not say how much of the growth wasdriven by fiscal spending although it had estimated that 1.5percentage points of the previously seen 2.3 percent expansionwas due to stimulus. Finance Ministry economic policy division director, YoonJong-won, told reporters the government had already used up 5trillion won ($4 billion) over the past two month slated forthe fourth quarter. That leaves 5-7 trillion won in advancespending for this month. The government is front-loading the stimulus spendingbecause it believes global economic conditions will improve inthe final months of the year, he added. The amount it is spending -- pushing the fiscal deficitthis year to 5 percent of GDP -- means fiscal balance will beachieved by 2013 or 2014, later than the originally targetted2012, Yoon said.
