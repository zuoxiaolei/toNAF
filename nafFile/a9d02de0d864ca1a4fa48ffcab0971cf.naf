<raw><![CDATA[ MOSCOW, April 6 (Reuters) - Oil price movements, internalKremlin politics and the risk of insurgent attacks will providethe key political risks for investors in Russia in the aftermathof lethal subway bombings last week. Following are some of the key issues.  OIL PRICE Russia, currently the biggest energy producer in the world,is heavily dependent on oil and gas exports so a fall in prices would likely lead to a sell off in the equity and bondmarkets and undermine recovery after the worst annualcontraction since 1994. The economy contracted by 7.9 percent in 2009 but majorinvestment banks expect the economy to bounce back, growing byaround 4 percent in 2010. Still, an extended economic slump could undermine thepopularity of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who is consideredby most Russians to be the country's real leader. Putin, who as Kremlin chief presided over the longestRussian boom in a generation, has taken personal charge ofmeasures aimed at easing the crisis. A sharp decline in oil prices would limit the Kremlin'sability to pump money into Soviet-era factories, a step that hasprevented tens of thousands of redundancies. What to watch: -- A short-term oil price rise would drive investment andRussian securities could quickly soar on a relatively smallinflow of foreign capital, cutting the need for foreignborrowing, pulling Russia out of recession faster than expectedand driving new oil and gas investment. -- The appreciation of the rouble  against the dollarand euro could hinder Russia's recovery by making importscheaper, undermining domestic manufacturers. -- Russia's sale of up to $18 billion in Eurobonds, itsfirst major sovereign issuance in a decade. Russia should haverelatively little problem with the sale, but analysts say muchmore borrowing could be needed in the future with the budgetexpected to stay in deficit for years to come. -- Putin's popularity has remained high in recent months butRussia has seen a wave of protests against the authoritiesagainst high unemployment and surging bills for local rates.  KREMLIN POWER Putin is believed to be firmly in charge of the countrydespite stepping down as president in 2008 and relations withPresident Dmitry Medvedev are generally believed to be good. Putin is the dominant member of the so called tandem and hasretained his high popularity with voters despite the crisis, soany indication that he might leave his post, would haveunpredictable consequences. Any strong signal from Putin that he will run for presidentin 2012, could spark a rally in Russian assets. The nextpresident will be able to rule for two consecutive six-yearterms after Medvedev changed the constitution in late 2008. Medvedev, despite indications that he favours cautiousreform of politics and the judiciary, has so far had littleimpact. Most of the key posts in the Kremlin administration andthe cabinet are held by longtime Putin loyalists. If Medvedev started making a lot of his own appointmentswithin the Kremlin, that would mark a major shift in the balanceof power and could herald major policy changes. So far, this hasnot happened. What to watch: -- Any strong sign that Putin will run for president in2012. Markets could rally if he made such a signal. -- Senior appointments in the Kremlin or government couldindicate a shift in the balance of power. -- Frictions have emerged between members of the Putin andMedvedev teams. Any escalation could have far reachingconsequences.  ATTACKS BY INSURGENTS The deadliest spate of suicide bombings for six years hasraised concerns that Islamist rebels from the North Caucasuscould unleash a wave of attacks against the Russian heartland. Islamist rebels -- who want to create a pan-Caucasus,sharia-based state along Russia's southern flank -- have claimedresponsibility for the March 29 suicide bombings in the Moscowmetro and have vowed more attacks. The self-proclaimed leader of the militants, a Chechen rebelnamed Doku Umarov who calls himself the "Emir of the CaucasusEmirate", has vowed to attack economic infrastructure such asthe pipelines which feed Russia's $1.3 trillion economy. Markets have so far shrugged off the attacks, but anyfurther strikes against Russian cities or against economicinfrastructure such as pipelines or even atomic power stationscould spook investors. What to watch: -- Further attacks against Russian cities. -- Sharp reaction from Putin on the bombings, includingstrikes against militants in the North Caucasus. -- Opinion polls showing Putin's popularity has risen orfallen on the attacks. -- If Russia says the militants are being supported by anyforeign state.
