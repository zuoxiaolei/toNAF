<raw><![CDATA[ * Egypt is largest buyer of Russian wheat * Russia has enough quality wheat to meet demand - trade * Wheat can be loaded at Novorossiisk port * Russia successful at latest Egyptian tender * Supplies only slightly down from last year  By Aleksandras Budrys MOSCOW, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Russia will find enough qualitywheat at the right price to meet tough new import termsintroduced this year by Egypt, its largest export market, aftera row over grain quality, Russian traders and analysts said. Russia has exported 1.8 million tonnes of wheat to Egyptsince the start of the current season in July, only slightlyless than a year ago, a senior trader with a major Russian grainexporter told Reuters on Wednesday. "We have sufficient grain and we have the conditions to meetthe Egyptian requirements," the trader said. "Quality is not anissue if prices are acceptable." Major wheat consumer Egypt, reliant on imports for abouthalf of its needs, became embroiled in the row over grainquality after an investigation was ordered into Russian wheatimported by an Egyptian firm in May. Tougher import terms have snarled cargoes into Egypt and ledto higher freight charges, though Trade Minister Rachid MohamedRachid said on Nov. 20 the government had no plans to add newconditions to its quality-control measures. Changes have included a requirement for 55,000-60,000-tonnecargoes only, rather than 30,000-tonne ships often seen fromRussia, and for consignments to be loaded only at one port. Egypt has also demanded wheat with bug content of up to 1percent. Russian market participants said on Wednesday thiswould not pose a problem. "If Russia is offered a good price, it can find sufficientwheat, even with bug content of 0.5 percent and less," VitalySmirnov, an operations manager at the Russian unit of theInspectorate commodity inspection company, told Reuters.  TENDER SUCCESS Egyptian demand for Russian wheat was borne out at thelatest tender on Wednesday by government wheat buyer GASC. GASC, the General Authority for Supply Commodities, bought240,000 tonnes of Russian wheat from four separate traders atits latest tender, all at $198.75 per tonne. French grain trader Granit said this month that it expectedRussian stocks of wheat with 1 percent bug content to be scarceand inspection group SGS said that Black Sea wheat quality thisyear was quite low. "In fact, wheat quality this year is higher than last year,"said Andrei Sizov Sr., chief executive of leading Russianagricultural analysts SovEcon. "Although there may not be sufficient quality grain in thesouth of Russia, it may be found in western Siberia," he said. Sizov said the new Egyptian terms were actually favourableto Russia, which could load the required volumes at its BlackSea port of Novorossiisk, while ruling out France's top grainport, Rouen. "The Germans could benefit, as they have sufficient grain ofthe necessary quality this year and their Baltic sea freightrates are quite low," Sizov said.
