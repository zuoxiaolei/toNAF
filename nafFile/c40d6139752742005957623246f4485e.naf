<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar is trading broadly lower against its major rivals during Thursday’s Asian session as traders appear to be buying into the notion that risk appetite has returned to financial markets after two-day surge for U.S. stocks. Some profit-taking given the greenback’s recent strength may also be at play.  In Asian trading Thursday, EUR/USD rose 0.14% to 1.3155 after Italy was able to sell EUR6.5 billion in five and 10-year bonds. The yield on Italian 10-year bonds rose to 4.83%, the highest since October, from 4.17% at a similar auction last month, but demand was robust and that was viewed a positive sign. USD/JPY jumped 0.28% to 92.49 as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to submit nominees for governor of Bank of Japan and two deputy governor slots later today. Asian Development Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda is widely expected to be Abe’s choice to be the central bank’s next leader. GBP/USD rose 0.08% to 1.5170 while USD/CHF fell 0.11% to 0.9288. USD/CAD fell 0.03% to 1.0229 on the back of higher oil prices, which were helped by some decent U.S. data points. In U.S. economic news, the National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index rose 4.5% in January. The index reading of 109.5 is the highest since April 2010. The Commerce Department said durable goods orders fell 5.2% in January after a 4.3% December increase. Excluding transportation, durable goods orders increased 1.9% in January, good for the sharpest increase since December 2011. AUD/USD added 0.35% to 1.0271 after the Reserve Bank of Australia said that Australian private sector credit increased by 0.2% in January after a 0.4% increase in December. Analysts expected a January rise of 0.3%. In another report, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said that Australian private new capital expenditure fell to a seasonally adjusted rate of -1.2% in the fourth quarter from 1.1% in third quarter. The third-quarter reading was revised down from 2.8%. Analysts expected a fourth-quarter increase of 1%. NZD/USD rose 0.27% to 0.8300 while the U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.03% to 81.58.             ]]></raw>
