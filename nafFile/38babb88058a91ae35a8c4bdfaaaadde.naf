<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar slips, Dubai to get funds from Abu Dhabi * Yen initially sold on position squeeze, recovers losses * Fed policy meeting coming into focus  By Jamie McGeever and Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped on Mondayafter Dubai's announcement it had received help from Abu Dhabito repay its debts bolstered risk appetite and eroded some ofthe U.S. currency's safe-haven appeal. The currency market's bent to sell dollars on improved riskappetite -- global equities bounced on the $10 billion bailout-- contrasted with last week when strong U.S. economic databoosted risk sentiment to the benefit of stocks and the dollar. The dollar index retreated on Monday from its highest inmore than a month hit last week, after Abu Dhabi agreed to bailout its debt-laden neighbour with $10 billion in aid, easingworries about a possible debt default by Dubai. The bailout announcement also triggered selling in thelow-yielding yen. But the initial dollar and yen weaknessfizzled out as the European session progressed, particularly inthe yen as traders cited talk of Japanese repatriation. The euro's gains were also capped as Dubai's debt issuesunderlined fiscal concerns in other countries, including Greece,whose credit rating was cut last week. "There's been an improvement in the performance of riskyassets and risky currencies today ... and the mood is moreupbeat," said Standard Chartered FX strategist Rob Minikin. "There was an initial dollar sell-off in some of the majorcrosses, but that's somewhat lost momentum. The sense is thatthe dominant theme in recent weeks was one in which creditjitters outside the U.S. were dollar constructive but that hasunwound a little bit today," he said. At 1235 GMT the dollar index, a measure of the greenbackagainst six major currencies, was down 0.2 percent at 76.417,capped by resistance at the 100-day moving average of 76.691.Last week it hit a near six-week high of 76.726. The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.4650, having climbed toaround $1.4685 after Dubai said it had received funding from AbuDhabi to help repay $4.1 billion in an Islamic bond maturing onMonday. Last month, news that government-controlled holding companyDubai World might default rattled financial markets and led to asell-off in the euro and riskier assets, including thehigh-yielding Australian dollar. The euro barely moved after euro zone employment andproduction figures. Late last week, it hit a two-month low of$1.4586 on the EBS trading platform on the back of strong U.S.retail sales and consumer sentiment figures.  FED IN FOCUS The dollar fell 0.6 percent to 88.50 yen, unable to sustaina jump to around 89 yen after Dubai's announcement. Traderscited Japanese exporters selling the greenback after its rise. The retreat in dollar/yen helped to prompt a broad buy-backin the yen, which recovered from initial selling againsthigher-risk currencies, including sterling and the Australianand New Zealand dollars. "The market's reaction to the Dubai news was relativelypositive, but there remain question marks relating to the broadissue of sovereign risk, which will be one of the themes goinginto 2010." said Ned Rumpeltin, currency strategist at Nomura. Traders were also looking ahead to a two-day Federal Reservepolicy meeting, which begins on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is likely to keep rates unchanged nearzero, but the focus will be on the accompanying statement andwhether the Fed reiterates a dovish bias and does not fullyacknowledge the recent run of strong data. The surprisingly strong reading of U.S. consumer data onFriday, coming on the heels of a lower-than-expected fall innon-farm payrolls earlier this month, had boosted the dollar. Such signs of recovery in the U.S. economy have raised somespeculation in the market that the Fed may wind down loosemonetary policy sooner than markets had been expecting. "We had a one-two punch of the payrolls and the retail salesdata, so maybe the market is getting optimistic about a U.S.recovery," said Rumpeltin at Nomura. "But we don't think the market should get ahead of itselfand start to anticipate an early Fed rate rise."             ]]></raw>
