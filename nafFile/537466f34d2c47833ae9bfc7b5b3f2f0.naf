<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds details, graphics, background)  * Services PMI above 50 for first time since May 2008 * Factory PMI highest since June 2008, just shy of 50 * Composite employment index falls  By Jonathan Cable LONDON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Euro zone services business grewfor the first time in 16 months in September and factory outputincreased for the second month running, according to surveys onWednesday that suggested the bloc has pulled out of recession. But while the 16-nation bloc's dominant service sectorbounced back to better-than-expected growth the manufacturingsector contracted further -- and at a faster pace than had beenpredicted by analysts. Economists were nearly unanimous in a view that while therecovery is welcome, the data did not signal a rebound to stronggrowth but instead suggested a gradual recovery from here.  "All in all, the PMIs confirm that a V-shaped recovery isunlikely in the euro zone. The ECB forecasts something closer toan L-shaped recovery, and these data do little to change theirmind," said Marco Valli at UniCredit. "Expect no significantchanges in their rhetoric for the next several months." European Central Bank Governing Council Member Ewald Nowotnyechoed this on Wednesday when he was quoted in a newspaper assaying he expected to see an L-shaped recovery. Markit's Eurozone Flash Services Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI), compiled from surveys of around 2,000 companies, climbedto 50.6 in September from 49.9 in August, its highest levelsince May 2008 and just above expectations. The services index is now above the 50 mark that dividesgrowth from contraction and should reassure the ECB that itsloose monetary policies are working. Business expectations in the service sector jumped to athree and a half year high this month, significantly up fromAugust and suggesting businesses are also sharing the optimismof economists and financial markets. However, the euro zone flash manufacturing index missedexpectations coming in at 49.0, but this was up from 48.2 inAugust and its highest reading since June 2008. But output of the manufacturing sector expanded for thesecond consecutive month, amd was only slightly down from the15-month high seen in August. This upturn was corroborated by data on Wednesday showingeuro zone new industrial new orders rose more than expected inJuly, pointing to a pick up in activity. The combined rises in the services and manufacturing indexestook the Composite Index to a 16-month high of 50.8, up fromAugust but just below the 51.0 predicted by economists. The euro zone economy contracted 0.1 percent in the secondquarter of this year, having shrunk 2.5 percent in the firstquarter -- the sharpest decline on record -- but economistspolled by Reuters last week expect it to grow 0.3 percent in thecurrent quarter. "Probably from now on the improvements will be much smaller.If the recovery is to be sustainable we want to see thesenumbers continue rising but at a pace which is much lower thanwhat we have seen since February," said Silvio Peruzzi at RBS.  FLASH FLOATING Separate flash PMIs earlier on Wednesday showed servicesector activity grew in the 16-nation bloc's two biggesteconomies in September after both Germany and France surprisedmarkets with returns to economic growth in the second quarter. The German services PMI nudged down to 52.2 this month, butremained in expansionary territory, while the manufacturing PMIfor the euro zone's biggest economy rose to 49.6 from 49.2, justshy of the break even point. The French services PMI moved back into expansionaryterritory for the first time since last September while themanufacturing sector grew for the second month running, bothbeating expectations. But it has not all been good news. French consumer spendingfell in August, confounding expectations of a rise, while inGermany the ZEW economic think tank's September survey fellshort of expectations despite rising to a three-year high. While the PMIs suggest the economic outlook may beimproving, job prospects deteriorated and the pace of layoffsaccelerated across the eurozone, according to the survey. Rises in unemployment may temper any growth as consumersremain cautious about spending. Unemployment was at a 10-yearhigh of 9.5 percent in July and is seen rising higher to 10.8percent towards the end of next year. (Editing by Andy Bruce/David Stamp/Victoria Main)             ]]></raw>
