<raw><![CDATA[ * Asia shares up 1.4 pct, commodities boost resource plays * Seoul shares buck trend and slip as c.bank rate hike eyed * Aussie hits 14-mth high, rally extends after RBA hike * Gold slips but holds near record high By Eric Burroughs HONG KONG, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Asian shares pushed up for asecond day on Wednesday, with Taiwan's benchmark index nearinga 16-month high, as growing confidence in a strengtheningglobal recovery boosted resource and financial companies. European shares, however, were set for a sluggish start,with futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 index  little changedin early trade. Gold trimmed some gains but hovered near the all-time highof $1,043.45  hit on Tuesday, highlighting the dollar'swoes after the U.S. currency was hit the previous day by areport that major countries were looking at alternatives to thegreenback for settling oil trades, including gold and othercurrencies. The report was later denied by some of the countries saidto be involved. U.S. crude oil prices rose 59 cents a barrel to $71.46, adding to gains scored the previous day as commoditiessurged on hopes that global demand was picking up. Australian miners and Japanese trading houses were amongthe big winners, with shares of Rio Tinto  andMitsubishi Corp <8058.T> both jumping more than 5 percent. Some investors also took heart from Australia's centralbank lifting interest rates the previous day, the first of anyGroup of 20 nation to do so in a sign that the emergencymeasures put in place to stem the financial crisis aregradually being unwound. The Australian dollar  hit a 14-month high above$0.892 as investors bet on more rate rises later this yearafter the surprise quarter-point hike to 3.25 percent. The rateincrease was seen as a sign the global economy was on the mendand fueled gains of more than 1 percent on Wall Street. [.N] "The RBA set the cat amongst the pigeons by becoming thefirst G20 central bank to hike rates. The move likelyaccelerated the issue of yield re-emerging as a key currencydriver the coming months," said analysts at Calyon in a note toclients. "The hike is unlikely, however, to be quickly followedby the U.S., Japan or Europe." Some economists noted that Australia is a special casebecause its economy and banking system were mostly shelteredfrom the global crisis and has benefitted from China'saggressive efforts to stockpile resources and kick startgrowth. Many major central banks are unlikely to raise rates forsome time, trying to ensure there is no dip back intorecession. Federal Reserve officials remain cautious about unwindingemergency measures. Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenigsaid late on Tuesday that the U.S. economy is clearlyrecovering but that it is too soon for the Fed to withdraw itsmassive support. [ID:nN06331249] The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 1.4 percent, with the material sectorthe biggest gainer on the day. The Thomson Reuters index ofregional shares  edged up 1 percent. Japan's Nikkei average  gained 1.2 percent, withfinancials getting a boost from a rise in U.S. counterparts theprevious day after Goldman Sachs upgraded the sector. Thebanking sector on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first sector rose3.6 percent. But South Korea's KOSPI index  lagged the regionwith a rise of just 0.2 percent as investors fretted thecountry's central bank could follow Australia and lift ratesfrom a record low as soon as a policy meeting on Friday. Many market players are now expecting the Bank of Korea tolift rates in November from the current 2.0 percent. Trading volumes were about average across the region, andshort-covering in some sectors such as financials played a rolein the rise. DOLLAR ON THE BACKFOOT The dollar edged up after being hit the previous day by thecombination of a surging Australian dollar, gold andcommodities. The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against sixmajor currencies, drifted down 0.1 percent to 76.262  butis still near a 13-month low of 75.827 hit in September. The dollar edged down 0.3 percent against the yen to 88.55yen  and has slid back near an eight-month low of 88.23yen hit last month. Those levels are seen as painful toJapanese exporters by slashing the value of their overseasrevenue. Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told the WallStreet Journal that current yen levels were consistent withacceptable market activity and were not "extremely abnormal,"the latest signal Japan's new government is taking a morehands-off approach on currency policy. [ID:nT268920] Fujii and other officials have made remarks suggesting theycould intervene to stem yen strength, though many marketplayers believe such intervention is unlikely unless the yen'srise becomes more volatile. Government bonds were mixed as traders reassessed interestrate prospects. Korean bond futures  erased earlier losses anddrifted up 3 ticks to 108.78, bouncing back from Tuesday'sslide after Australia's rate hike was seen as paving the wayfor a move in South Korea, where the central bank is worriedabout a rebounding property market.
