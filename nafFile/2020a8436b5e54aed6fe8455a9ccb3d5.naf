<raw><![CDATA[ WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The United States and Chinahave reached a critical juncture in their relationship and mustwork to establish more effective cooperation, U.S. Secretary ofState Hillary Clinton said on Friday. In a speech at the State Department, Clinton said theUnited States does not view China's rise as a threat and is notinterested in constraining Beijing's growth. Clinton's remarks follow a week of China policy speeches byU.S. cabinet officials -- and a trip to Beijing by DefenseSecretary Robert Gates -- aimed at setting the tone forPresident Barack Obama's Jan. 19 summit with President HuJintao. Some U.S. analysts see Hu's trip as the most importantstate visit in 30 years, as the leaders of the world's twobiggest economies try to put behind them an unusually stormy2010 and lock in forward-looking ties for the coming years. Washington and Beijing sparred last year over longstandingissues such as U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, the status of Tibet'sDalai Lama and human rights. They also became embroiled inspats over newer problems, including deadly North Koreanattacks on South Korea, South China Sea navigation rights, andtrade in rare earth minerals.
