<raw><![CDATA[ * Fears impact if Western austerity aid will hit aid * Global currency face-off could also dent growth * Believes African countries institutionally stronger  By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - States like Somalia and SierraLeone could ultimately cost the international community moremoney if they were destabilised by short-term cuts in Westernaid, Africa's main representative to the IMF said on Tuesday. Executive director Samuel Itam, who represents 20 Africancountries at the IMF board including South Africa and Nigeria,told Reuters he understood why European governments, trying toreduce record deficits, would target aid to Africa. But reducing aid could undo recent gains and create longerterm problems that would be more expensive to solve, he said. InSierra Leone, cutting aid would force the government "...to findother resources... or completely dismantle programmes," he said. "It is an easy thing to -- there is no domestic politicalreaction if you cut foreign aid," he said. "But that is tooshort-term and too myopic -- it will come back to hurt you inthe longer run. Medium term, if you want stability and peace youhave to contribute." Africa could also be threatened if a global currencystand-off worsened, but overall, the continent was better placedthan ever before to benefit from record commodity prices andcompetition between developed and emerging powers, Itam said. He said that while new investment from China and elsewherewas welcome, it was much more narrowly focused on singleinvestment projects and could not simply replace Western aid. Overall, he said his base case prediction was that Africawould continue to grow by about 5-5.5 percent per year -- butsignificant donor reductions or other shocks could reduce thisand it remained short of the 7-7.5 percent needed to seriouslyreduce poverty. He said he was also concerned by rising global tensions overcurrency strength, with the United States and China facing offand many emerging economies keen to weaken their currencies topromote exports.  Some worry that trade protectionism could result. "Thatcould become adverse for sub-Saharan African countries as itwould eventually feed through to demand for their exports." While South Africa might benefit in some ways from imposingcapital controls to cap currency strength as it would makeexports more competitive, its economy would also suffer ascontrols would deter foreign investment, Itam said. "Having a weaker currency would only bring temporarybenefit," he said. High commodity prices and international competition overAfrican resources have sometimes fuelled conflict andcorruption, but Itam said institutions were now much stronger. Countries such as Uganda were rigorous in ensuring moneyfrom new oilfields was ringfenced, he said, adding that his owncountry, Sierra Leone, would learn from its diamond-fuelledcivil war when it came to handling new potential oil wealth. "I think the key change is that ordinary people understandthis and really demand transparency," he said. "With SierraLeone, everyone knows diamonds were a disaster and I think thatwill help us to do it better this time round." (Editing by Tim Pearce)             ]]></raw>
