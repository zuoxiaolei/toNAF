<raw><![CDATA[ * Drop in Treasury yields weighs on U.S. currency * Investors prepare for next week's Fed meeting * One-week implied vols for euro/dollar rise (Recasts with reaction to U.S. data, updates prices, addsdetail, adds comments, changes dateline, previous LONDON) NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped onThursday, surrendering some gains from the last two days, asU.S. Treasury yields fell, making them less attractive andeasing demand for the dollars to buy them. A recent move to trim extreme short dollar positions, amidspeculation the Federal Reserve will announce plans to buy moreassets next week, also slowed. The New York Federal Reserve has surveyed bond dealers andinvestors over the size and impact of a quantitative easingprogramme, with scenarios ranging from zero up to $1 trillion,Bloomberg news reported on Thursday, citing a copy of thesurvey. [ID:nLDE69R15M] Traders said dollar selling against the euro and othercurrencies by reserve managers was also helping to push theU.S. currency down. "In this case we are getting a little bit of a driver fromlower yields," said Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst atFX Solutions in Saddle River, New Jersey. "Lower yields and alower dollar go together." In early New York trade, the euro  had risen 0.8percent on the day to $1.3876. This helped to push the dollar 0.82 percent lower versus a currency basket on the daythough it is down only a marginal 0.5 percent for the year todate. The 10-year Treasury note  was up 8/32 in priceto yield 2.69 percent, down from 2.72 percent late onWednesday. An unexpected drop in initial weekly jobless claimson Thursday capped prices on U.S. Treasury debt though theywere still up from the previous session. NARROWING SPREADS Other analysts said the dollar was also weighed down by anarrowing in spreads between 10-year U.S. and euro zonegovernment bonds. But the euro held above a one-week low around $1.3734 hit on electronic trading platform EBS on Wednesday,even as debt concerns in Ireland and Greece and a breakdown inbudget talks in Portugal highlighted problems facing peripheryeuro zone countries. Peter Frank, currency strategist at Societe Generale inLondon, said support for the euro despite sovereign debt issuesillustrated the resilience of the single currency, and that heexpected it to rise back above $1.40 in the near term. But worries about the banking sector and the region's debtproblems could check the euro's gains. The European CentralBank's quarterly Bank Lending Survey said more banks expect totighten their credit standards for corporate loans in Q4. The news could check hawkish ECB intentions to scale backemergency stimulus measures, said Tom Levinson, a forexstrategist at ING. "This serves as a warning on what is goingon in the real economy. It's less of a positive for euro butthe real dominant force is still the U.S. story." U.S. STORY Wall Street analysts expect the Federal Reserve to buy $80billion to $100 billion worth of assets per month under a newprogramme widely expected to be unveiled on Nov. 3, accordingto a Reuters poll. [FED/R] Estimates for how much the Fed will eventually spend variedfrom $250 billion to $2 trillion. The market has been scalingback expectations as the event draws nearer. "The issue is whether the market believes the Fed willdeliver significant quantitative easing over a definitive timeline," said Frank at Societe Generale. "If they do, the dollarwill weaken." Lingering uncertainty about how the Fed will announce moreQE has increased market volatility, with one-week impliedvolatility for euro/dollar  jumping to 15.3 percent onThursday from 12.6 percent at the start of the week. Against the yen, the dollar  fell 0.7 percent to81.11 yen. The Japanese currency showed little reaction to aBank of Japan decision to keep interest rates virtually at zerowhile holding off from new policy initiatives.The dollar is holding above a 15-year low of 80.41 yen hitearlier this week on EBS, but investors remain vigilant for anyyen-weakening intervention after authorities entered the marketlast month.
