<raw><![CDATA[ (Corrects third paragraph from the end to say yuan is believedto be undervalued against the dollar) * U.S. imports show biggest monthly gain since March 1993 * Economic upturn trumping dollar decline on trade gap * U.S. deficit with China highest since November 2008 By Doug Palmer WASHINGTON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficitwidened in September by an unexpectedly large 18.2 percent, thelargest increase in more than 10 years, as oil prices rose forthe seventh straight month and imports from China boundedhigher. Adding urgency to talks President Barack Obama will havewith Chinese leaders in coming days, the monthly trade gap grewto $36.5 billion, from a slightly revised estimate of $30.8billion in August, the Commerce Department said on Friday. The monthly trade gap grew to $36.5 billion, from aslightly revised estimate of $30.8 billion in August, theCommerce Department said on Friday. Wall Street analysts had expected the shortfall to growmodestly in September to around $31.65 billion. Both U.S. exports and imports had their best month sinceDecember 2008. But in a sign of renewed U.S. economic growth,imports grew 5.8 percent in September, the biggest monthly gainsince March 1993, while exports rose 2.9 percent. Some analysts had expected more of an export boost becausethe drop in the value of the dollar against other majorcurrencies makes American goods more competitive overseas. But "the overall upturn in U.S. demand is trumping the fallof the dollar," said Craig Peckham, an equity tradingstrategist with Jefferies and Company in New York. TRADE FLOWS PICKING UP Imports of industrial supplies and materials showed thebiggest gain in September, suggesting that U.S. manufacturersare ramping up for production. International trade flows are picking up as massivestimulus from governments and central banks lift the globaleconomy out of its deepest swoon since the 1930s. The EU statistics office Eurostate said the euro-zoneeconomy grew 0.4 percent in the third quarter from the secondquarter, snapping the region's recession. For details,see[ID:nLD682325] The U.S. government said last month the U.S. economy grewat an annual rate 3.5 percent in the third quarter after fourcontractionary quarters. The average price for imported oil leapt to $68.17 perbarrel and imports from the Organization of Petroleum ExportCountries increased to $11.9 billion in September, both thehighest since November 2008. A separate report showed U.S. import prices rose for thethird straight month in October, pushed up by a jump in thecost of fuel imports and the depreciating dollar. Import prices advanced 0.7 percent after a revised 0.2percent increase in September that was previously reported as a0.1 percent gain, the Labor Department said. The weak U.S. dollar is helping to lift U.S. exports, butat the same time, analysts cite it as a factor pushing up theprice of oil and other commodities. The U.S. dollar extended losses against the yen after thetrade data. U.S. stock index futures held gains, while U.S.Treasury debt prices were steady at lower levels.              "Although import prices were up, they were up less thanexpected. Again, with the weak dollar, you would have thoughtyou would have seen more inflation on import prices," said TimGhriskey, chief investment officer with Solaris AssetManagement in Bedford Hills New York. US TRADE GAP WITH CHINA WIDENS The closely watched U.S. trade deficit with China widened9.2 percent to $22.1 billion as imports grew 8.3 percent to$27.9 billion, both also the highest since November 2008. For a graphic on the U.S. trade deficit with China see:http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/119/GLB_USCH1109.gif The overall U.S. trade deficit, including with China, hasfallen significantly this year in response to the worsteconomic downturn in decade. But the gap with China narrowed just 15.9 percent in thefirst nine months of the year, compared with much biggerdeclines for Canada (79.6 percent), the European Union (42.0percent) and OPEC (71.8 percent). That has reinforced ideas that China's currency remainsundervalued against the dollar, giving Chinese companies anunfair trade advantage. President Barack Obama is expected to raise concerns aboutChina's exchange rate regime when he meets with Chinese leadersnext week in Beijing. On Friday he was in Japan for talksbefore heading to Singapore for this weekend's annual summitmeeting with leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperationforum.  With U.S. unemployment the highest in 26 years, Obama hassaid he would press for a rebalancing of world economic growthwhere countries in Asia would open their markets to moreAmerican goods and rely less on exports to the United Statesand more on their own domestic demand.
