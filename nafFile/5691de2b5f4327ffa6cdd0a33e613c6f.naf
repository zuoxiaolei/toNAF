<raw><![CDATA[ * Osborne indicates capital gains tax rise, bank levy * Announces pension commission, payroll tax relief for some * Expected to freeze next year's England council tax  (Adds council tax rise freeze) LONDON, June 20 (Reuters) - The biggest threat to Britain'seconomy is its huge budget deficit, and an emergency budget onTuesday will save the country from the fate of debt-strickenGreece, British finance minister George Osborne said on Sunday. Measures expected to be included in the budget include abank levy and reform of welfare benefits and public sector pay.Other plans include payroll tax breaks for new businesses, acouncil tax freeze and a review of public sector pensions. "You can see in Greece an example of a country that didn'tface up to its problems, and that is the fate that I want toavoid," Osborne told the BBC in an interview. "I'm absolutely clear, I don't want the question even asked,'Can Britain pay its way in the world?' I'm going to prove onTuesday that we can," he said, adding that the budget'sausterity measures would be staggered over five years. Britain's budget deficit is at about 11 percent of nationaloutput, and reducing the deficit is the centrepiece policy ofthe new coalition government, made up of the centre-rightConservative Party and centre-left Liberal Democrats. Tuesday's budget is expected to be the tightest in at least30 years, and with public sector job losses and deep pay andbenefit cuts expected, the plan is likely to stoke publicdiscontent and strain the fledgling ruling alliance. Osborne indicated capital gains tax -- a tax on the sale ofassets such as real estate and shares  -- would rise, despitevigorous opposition from senior Conservative politicians. The levy is currently at 18 percent, and some workers switchtheir income revenue, which is taxed at between 20 and 50percent, to capital gains to pay less tax. "Here is a tax where at the moment we see massive income taxevasion, we see people shifting their income ... and that's notfair given the current situation, so we'll deal with that,"Osborne said, without saying by how much the levy will rise. He also raised the prospect of unilateral action to impose abank levy, aimed at clawing back billions paid by the state tobail the financial sector out after the 2008 financial crisis. Countries are trying to coordinate to introduce new bankingrules in tandem to avoid regulation arbitrage, but progress sofar has been slow. "The previous government didn't want a bank levy, becausethey wanted every country in the world to sign up to one beforethey would agree to one in Britain. I don't think that's fair,and I'm going to ask the banks to pay a bank levy."  SWEETENERS One of the few sweeteners expected in the budget is apayroll tax holiday for the first 10 employees hired by newbusinesses outside Britain's southeast, government sources said. The maximum a business can claim per employee will be 5,000pounds ($7,400) a year for those earning less than 44,800pounds, a three-year scheme costing 900 million pounds and meantto boost the economy in less prosperous parts of Britain. Sources familiar with Osborne's budget said he would alsotell local authorities in England not to raise council tax inthe 2011-2012 financial year. Osborne told the BBC he had set up a commission on publicservice pensions, seen by some critics as too costly, to bechaired by John Hutton, a former opposition Labour party cabinetminister, a move meant to produce a non-partisan review. The commission will produce an interim report in September,and a final report in time for next year's budget. Critics of deep spending cuts soon say it puts Britain atrisk of a "double dip" recession, just as it emerges from itsworst recession since World War Two. A ComRes poll for the Independent on Sunday found supportfor Britain's three main political parties largely unchangedsince the May 6 general election, but showed divisions over somepossible austerity measures. Most of those polled last week agreed child benefits shouldbe withdrawn from wealthier people, 48 percent agreed they wouldrather pay higher income tax than see public services cut, and49 percent disagreed that the government was exaggeratingfinancial problems to justify public sector cuts.
