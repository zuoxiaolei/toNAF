<raw><![CDATA[ * Plan to keep exposure to forex risks at minimum * To buy longer JGBs despite growing issuance * Some to continue selling unhedged bonds in H2 * No.1 Nippon Life bought Y1.4 trln of hedged bonds in H1 By Satomi Noguchi TOKYO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Japan's biggest life insurers,whose investments in local and global markets total $1.6trillion, will stick to their policy of minimising exposure tocurrency volatility and focus on buying domestic debt. After being punished by a surge in the yen to 13-year highsearly this year, some of the top nine insurers told Reutersthis month they will keep dumping unhedged foreign bonds insecond half of the April-March year. Given that the insurers, who had traditionally been hugebuyers of foreign bonds, are expected to stay clear of currencyrisks in the coming months, analysts said the upward pressureon the yen against the dollar is likely to remain. "Japanese life insurers are not likely to contribute toUSD-JPY gains for the time being," said Tomoko Fujii, acurrency strategist at Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynchin Tokyo in a note to clients. The dollar lost as much as 13 percent against the yenbetween April and September, and at 92.00 yen it is stillhovering within reach of a 13-year low of 87.10 set in Januarythis year. Most of the top nine insures, whose investment roughlytotals Brazil's gross domestic product, slashed their foreignbond holdings last fiscal year at the height of the globalfinancial turmoil in favour of Japanese bonds. A rising yenerodes the value of foreign assets. The insurers plan to focus on buying yen bonds in theOctober-March half despite concerns about increasing supply andballooning Japanese public debt. No. 5 insurer, Mitsui Life, said it aims to purchase"super-long" Japanese government bonds and will speed up buyingif yields rise to levels seen in June and August. The yield on 20-year JGB rose to 2.2 percent in June, itshighest in eight months, while the 30-year debt yield hit 2.36percent in August, a 10-month peak. CUTTING FX EXPOSURE Meiji Yasuda, the nation's third-largest life insurer, saidit would shed a net 30 billion yen ($326 million) in unhedgedforeign bonds in the October-March second half, after cutting240 billion yen between April and September. Ninth-largest insurer, Fukoku Life, said it plans to slash60 billion yen of its unhedged foreign bond holdings. Sumitomo Life, the No. 4 life insurer, said it has notdecided whether to lower its hedging ratio for foreign bondsfor the rest of this fiscal year after raising it to 100percent last fiscal year. "We are keeping our cautious stance on currency movementsas there is a risk of future falls in the dollar," said IwaoMatsumoto, deputy general manager of the investment planningdepartment at Sumitomo Life. "We remain cautious about investment in unhedged foreignbonds." No. 1 life insurer, Nippon Life, scooped up 1.4 trillionyen in hedged foreign bonds in the six months to Septemberwhile No. 2 Dai-Ichi Life shifted some funds allocated to yenbonds into hedged foreign bonds. Falling hedging costs, or the narrowing in the spreadbetween Japanese and overseas short-term interest rates, werealso a strong incentive for insurers to purchase foreign bondsaggressively in the first half. In contrast, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury noterose as much as 240 basis points above the yield on thecomparable Japanese government bond between April andSeptember.
