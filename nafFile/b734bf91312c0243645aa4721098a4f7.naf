<raw><![CDATA[ * Nikkei at 6-mth closing low, MSCI ex-Japan hits 9-mth low * Euro resumes fall, Korean won tumbles * Korean peninsula tensions jangle nerves in East Asia * Crude below $69 on recovery worries; JGBs, Treasuriesgain By Alex Richardson SINGAPORE, May 25 (Reuters) - Asia stocks fell tomulti-month lows, the euro slid and oil and higher yieldingcurrencies weakened on Tuesday on fears that Europe's sovereigndebt woes will trigger a renewed crisis in the continent'sbanking sector. Heightened tensions and talk of war on the Korean peninsulaalso jangled investor nerves in East Asia. Europe's fumbling response to a Greek debt crisis andbulging deficits in other euro zone countries have unnervedmarkets over the past six weeks, and the central bank takeoverof a small Spanish lender at the weekend stoked fears of awider meltdown. "This situation with the Spanish bank makes investorsnervous because it raises suspicions that something else may besmouldering behind the scenes," said Hiroichi Nishi, equitydivision general manager at Nikko Cordial Securities in Tokyo. European stocks looked set to dive, with futures for theStoxx Europe 50 down 3.5 percent. Financial bookmakers werecalling the FTSE 100, DAX and CAC 40 to open down between 1.8and 2.6 percent. Funding conditions for banks have been tightening, withinstitutions in the United States increasingly reluctant todeal with firms with large exposure to Europe. "Investors are selling into every rally in the euro," saidJonathan Cavenagh, currency strategist at Australia's Westpac. "Worries about the euro debt crisis are showing signs ofspilling over to the banking sector with funding costs rising,albeit from very low levels. All this will only see more demandfor U.S. dollars." Money markets have seen an increasing reluctance to lend,particularly for longer terms, raising fears thatdollar-funding strains could further hobble troubled banks. The cost of lending dollars in Singapore jumped to an11-month high and benchmark LIBOR fixings were expected tocreep higher in London later. STOCKS TUMBLE Japan's Nikkei average fell 3.1 percent to mark a 6-monthclosing low below a key support level at 9,500. The index hasfallen around 17 percent from an 18-month high in early April. MSCI's broad measure of Asia-Pacific shares outside ofJapan tumbled 3.6 percent to touch its lowest in 9 months. Exporters exposed to the European market were heavy losers,with camera maker Canon down 2.7 percent and rival Nikonfalling 5.8 percent. In South Korea, the benchmark index lost 2.7 percent as areport that North Korean leader had told his military it mayhave to go to war -- but only if the South attacks -- alsoprompted foreign investors to sell. A trader at a European brokerage house in Tokyo said theslide in equities was at odds with macroeconomic fundamentalsand earnings trends, and was likely part of moves by investorsto cut exposure to risk, with one market player's stop-lossselling forcing another to cut positions as well. "I don't think things will get to the point of a financialcrisis, but the price action is similar to what was seen afterthe Lehman shock," the trader said. Credit markets seized up and stocks tumbled after thecollapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, marking the mostdangerous moment of the financial crisis that roiled theworld's markets and economies in 2007-2009. EURO SQUEEZE The euro resumed its slide as a recent short coveringbounce faded. Traders said with liquidity in the foreignexchange market showing signs of drying up, investors werelikely to shelter in the relative safe haven of the dollar. The euro slipped to around $1.2300 from $1.2376 late in NewYork on Monday, when it lost more than 1.5 percent. Against theyen, the euro fell 1 percent to 110.53. "Investors have started to sell the euro, believing thatthere'll be more banks in trouble, particularly in SouthernEurope," said a foreign exchange trader at a European bank inTokyo. "The euro's fall has not run its course." The South Korean won fell 2.8 percent against the dollar,its worst daily loss since March 2009, amid a sharp rise intensions after Seoul accused its communist neighbour of sinkingone of its warships. The U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen tend to gain whenthere is a spike in volatility and loss in risk appetite. Thedollar was up 0.7 percent against a basket of currencies.  The Australian dollar extended its fall, dropping nearly 1percent against the U.S. dollar and the yen at one point, ashedge funds and investors took profits on the higher-yieldingcurrency's rally this year. The fears of another financial crisis boosted the safehaven appeal of gold and U.S. and Asian government debt, withJapanese government bond futures hitting a two-year high. U.S.Treasuries also rose in Asian trade. June 10-year JGB futures rose as much as 0.37 point to atwo-year high of 140.62. The benchmark 10-year yield fell 3.5basis points to 1.215 percent. Ten-year Treasuries rose around 9/32 in price to yield3.165 percent, down about 4 basis points from late U.S.trading. U.S. crude futures fell 1.9 percent to below $69 a barrel,erasing the previous day's gains, on concerns the Europeancrisis will choke off the nascent economic recovery. NYMEXcrude for July delivery was down $1.36 cents at $68.85. Gold weakened in Asia due to the rising dollar, which makesthe metal more expensive for holders of other currencies, aftera rally overnight. Spot gold was bid at 1,192.10 an ounce by0610 GMT versus $1,194.95 an ounce at 1804 GMT.
