<raw><![CDATA[  * Euro jumps on expected rate hikes * Yen down vs dollar, EUR/JPY hits 10-month high * Market focus on rate differentials * Asset managers go tentatively long carry trades (Updates prices) By Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - The euro hit a 10-month highagainst the yen and rose against the dollar on Wednesday asmarkets braced for higher euro zone interest rates, while theAustralian dollar hit levels last seen in the early 1980s. The euro erased losses against the U.S. currency after aEuropean Central Bank policymaker said the ECB intends to raiserates gradually, which traders said suggests next week'sexpected hike may be the first of several. The prospect of higher euro zone borrowing costs bolsteredhopes the world economy was improving and encouraged investorsto take on more risk, a trend that looks set to carry the eurohigher in coming weeks and continue to hurt the yen. The euro in particular has shown exceptional staying power.It is up 5 percent against the dollar in 2011 despite lingeringfiscal problems in several euro zone states, prompting sometraders to refer to it as the "Teflon euro." Wednesday's remarks from the ECB's Lorenzo Bini Smaghishould help the currency extend gains, as they "hint that aseries of rate hikes may be coming this year," said BrianDolan, chief strategist at Forex.com. The euro's move above its 200-hour moving average around$1.4125 suggests a renewed uptrend, and a break of $1.4250would make a rally to $1.44-45 likely, Dolan said. The euro hit $1.4147 and was last at $1.4128, well off a$1.4049 session low. It was also trading at 117.12 yen, justbelow its highest level since May 2010. "I would be confident in the euro at these levels," saidPierre Lequeux, head of currency management at Aviva Investors."I like the euro, basically, and I see some upside." The dollar rose to around 83.19 yen, a level last seen onMarch 11, when the yen initially fell after Japan's earthquake.It last traded at 82.89 yen, up 0.5 percent. Traders reported offers from 83.30-50, with orders said tobe thin until more supply placed at around 84.00. REVIVING THE CARRY TRADE The dollar hit a record near 76 yen this month when anearthquake in Japan fed speculation the diaster would forceJapanese investors to bring money home from abroad. Japanese intervention stopped runaway yen gains and risingU.S. Treasury yields have since carried the dollar higher.Remarks from some Federal Reserve officials about the need totighten U.S. monetary policy may have contributed to the rise. Yield differentials are key to the revival of the "carrytrade," in which investors borrow in low-yielding, low-riskcurrencies such as the yen to fund more lucrative trades. "You can see the euro/yen relationship indicating that yencarry trade is being put back into play," said Paul Mendelsohn,chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services inCharlotte, Vermont. AUSSIE SHINES Investors also snapped up the high-yielding Australiandollar, which rose to $1.0338, its highest level since it wasfirst floated in the early 1980s. It also hit a 10-month highagainst the yen. Scotia Capital strategist Camilla Sutton said repatriationflows into Japan may yet materialize, which could help push theyen higher, at least against the dollar. Faros Trading analyst Dan Dorrow said the Aussie dollar'srecent highs are no reason to sell it. The market, he said, isoverestimating the chances of tighter U.S. monetary policy andunderestimating chances that the Reserve Bank of Australiacould still lift interest rates from 4.75 percent. "While domestic weaknesses may keep the RBA on hold forawhile, risks are for an upside surprise," he said.
