<raw><![CDATA[ * Jobs, push for exports to be a focus on nine-day tour * Beijing's signal on currencies may give Obama a boost * Asian countries may push back at Obama's trade message * Obama says to discuss strategy for balanced growth  (Updates with Obama's departure for Tokyo)  By Caren Bohan WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama leftfor Asia on Thursday with the U.S. economy, jobs and a yawningtrade deficit with China looming large on his agenda. Global climate change, the North Korean and Iranian nucleardisputes and Obama's review of his Afghanistan strategy arealso major topics for his talks with the Chinese and otherofficials on the first trip to Asia of his presidency. "I will be meeting with leaders abroad to discuss astrategy for growth that is both balanced and broadly shared,"Obama said at the White House before departing for Japan,underlining the economic focus of his week-long trip. "It is a strategy in which Asia and Pacific markets areopen to our exports and one in which prosperity around theworld is no longer as dependent on American consumption andborrowing but rather on American innovation and products." In an interview with Reuters this week, Obama describedChina as a "vital partner, as well as a competitor." But he warned of "enormous strains" in relations betweenthe world's two most powerful nations if economic imbalancesbetween them were not corrected. Those imbalances -- America's excessive consumption andborrowing, facilitated by China's aggressive export strategyand purchases of U.S. debt -- are seen by many as a major causeof the boom and subsequent bust in the global economy. Obama's nine-day tour includes a stop in Singapore for theAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, followed by visits toShanghai, Beijing and Seoul. Obama said he would talk to the Chinese about revaluingtheir currency, the yuan, as well as encouraging Chineseconsumers to spend more and opening Chinese markets further toU.S. goods. With the U.S. unemployment rate now at 10.2 percent, theObama administration hopes an emphasis on building exportopportunities will play well at home. Giving Obama a possible boost ahead of the trip, Chinasignaled on Wednesday it might allow appreciation of the yuan,saying it would consider major currencies -- not just thedollar -- in guiding the exchange rate. Soaring U.S. budget deficits have weakened the dollarbecause of U.S. borrowing to meet the day-to-day spending needsof the United States. The dollar has declined against a basketof major currencies since mid-February. U.S. manufacturers have long complained that Beijingartificially holds down the yuan's value to make Chineseexports cheaper and U.S. goods more costly for China. But Obama may face some pushback from China and othercountries who worry that Washington's drive for economiccooperation with Asia may be too one-sided. Beijing is upset over U.S. moves to slap tariffs on Chinesetires and steel pipes, while South Korea and other countriesharbor doubts over whether Obama, elected with strong laborunion support, is committed enough to a free-trade agenda. The Asia tour also comes as Obama juggles many pressingdomestic issues, including his drive to pass healthcare reformand climate change legislation, and nears the final stages of adecision on whether to send more U.S. troops in Afghanistan. SEEKING DEEPER TIES One of Obama's main messages will be a promise to put ahigh priority on engagement with the dynamic Asia-Pacificregion, an area of the world where he has personal connections,having grown up in Hawaii and Indonesia. "The president is the first president of the United Statesreally with an Asia-Pacific orientation," said Ben Rhodes,deputy national security adviser for strategic communications."He understands that the future of our prosperity and oursecurity is very much tied to this part of the world." Forging an effective working relationship with Beijing willbe crucial to any effort to deepen U.S. engagement in Asia. "I certainly think this administration differs from itspredecessors in its apparent recognition of the ascendancy ofChina and the ascendancy of Asia," said David Rothkopf, abusiness consultant and former U.S. official. The Obama administration's approach toward China, known as"Strategic Reassurance," builds on a Bush administration effortto ease mistrust between Washington and Beijing and encourageChina to become a responsible stakeholder in global affairs. Obama has been accused by some critics of giving shortshrift to human rights issues but he said he would bring up thesubject in his meetings in China. Underscoring the importance placed on the three-day Chinavisit, Obama's itinerary includes a formal state dinner, aseries of meetings with President Hu Jintao and Premier WenJiabao and a dialogue in Shanghai with Chinese youth. Japan will be another crucial leg of Obama's trip. Some inTokyo and in Washington worry about a drift in relationsbetween the two staunch allies. Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama campaigned on a pledge to seta more independent course from Washington and frictions havearisen over plans to relocate the U.S. military base on Japan'sOkinawa island. Many Japanese also wonder whether historic rival China'sgrowing economic and military clout will affect relationsbetween Washington and Tokyo, which mark the 50th anniversaryof their security alliance next year. Obama plans to make a major speech in Tokyo on Saturday inwhich he will discuss his view of U.S. engagement in Asia andreaffirm the strength of the U.S.-Japan alliance.
