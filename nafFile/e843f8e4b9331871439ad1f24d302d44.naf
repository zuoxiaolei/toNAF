<raw><![CDATA[ * Developing countries can promote low-carbon growth * Urged to harness investments by multinationals * Low-carbon investment flows totalled $90 billion in 2009  (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT 1700 GMT ON JULY 22) GENEVA, July 22 (Reuters) - Developing economies canjumpstart low-carbon economic growth through "clean" investmentpromotion policies, despite slow progress in internationalclimate negotiations, a United Nations agency said. The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) urgeddeveloping country governments to harness investments bymultinational companies to ensure that economic growth does notdrive up carbon emissions. Multinationals can help cut emissions by improvingproduction processes in their operations and along their valuechains and by making and marketing cleaner goods and services,UNCTAD said in its annual World Investment Report on Thursday. Flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) into key low-carbonbusiness areas such as renewables, recycling and low-carbontechnology amounted to roughly $90 billion in 2009, it said. But taking into account low-carbon investments in otherindustries, the actual total is much higher, it said. UNCTAD Secretary-General Supachai Panitchpakdi told abriefing that green technology was likely to see an investmentboom similar to railways, cars and information technology inprevious centuries. UNCTAD officials believe developing countries should seizethe opportunity or risk being shut out of developed markets. Forinstance, geographical location gives developing states hugepotential to develop solar power. The sectors with the most potential for this kind ofinvestment are power and industry, but transport, construction,waste management, forestry and agriculture can also benefit, theUNCTAD report said. At the same time there is a risk that companies will movehigh-emission operations to locations with laxer regulation,which can generate short-term economic growth for the countryconcerned while impeding global efforts to cut emissions. UNCTAD said this problem of "carbon leakage" should betackled at its source through corporate governance measures suchas improved environmental reporting, rather than through bordermeasures such as tariffs on carbon content. The report forecasts overall FDI inflows will pick up to$1.2 trillion this year and rise to $1.3-1.5 trillion in 2011.
