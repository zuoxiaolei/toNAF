<raw><![CDATA[ * Record $73 bln fund flows into HK raise asset bubblefears * C.bank head says rising Asian rates could aggravateinflows * Surging inflows pose problems for many emerging mkts (Adds measures to boost property mkt transparency, paragraph12) By Susan Fenton HONG KONG, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's central bankchief Norman Chan warned that asset prices in the city couldclimb sharply next year and disconnect from fundamentals,raising the risk of a bubble, and said surging capital inflowsposed a dilemma for policymakers across Asia. "With interest rates exceptionally low and with abundantliquidity around the world, Hong Kong faces the potential risknext year that asset prices may go up sharply and becomeincreasingly disconnected from economic fundamentals," Chan,head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said in an article onits website. While other economies could raise interest rates in a bidto curb inflation in assets such as property, that tactic couldbackfire and attract even more outside investors who are hungryfor higher yields, Chan noted. Hong Kong faces a different challenge. Its currency peg tothe U.S. dollar forces it to track monetary policy in theUnited States, which is expected to keep rates low for sometime. The financial centre, a key gateway to mainland China, alsoprides itself on its open economy and thus would be unlikely tolook at capital controls at this stage, analysts said. However,more measures to curb property speculation may be in theoffing.  Emerging markets such as Brazil and Taiwan have bothannounced capital controls in recent weeks to keep what theysay are "hot money" speculative flows from fueling sharp gainsin their currencies and destabilising their recoveringeconomies. Russia said on Thursday it would consider "soft" measuresto curb inflows, while Indonesia is also studying ways tocontrol foreign investment in one-month central bankbonds.[ID:nLJ437424] HOT MONEY Hong Kong attracted a record HK$567.5 billion (US$73billion) in fund inflows between Oct. 1 2008 and Nov. 13, 2009,according to the HKMA. That has helped Hong Kong stock pricessoar 57 percent this year and property prices surge nearly 30percent. Prices of luxury property in the city, however, have surgedover 40 percent this year as mainland Chinese have beensnapping up apartments. A weak dollar and expectations thatU.S., and therefore Hong Kong interest rates will stay low forsome time are also encouraging foreigners to buy Hong Kongassets. That prompted the HKMA last month to tighten mortgagelending rules, especially on luxury property, by capping themortgage limit for property valued at $2.6 million or more at60 percent, compared with 70 percent previously. However, asmany mainland Chinese buyers are flush with cash, that may notwork. The government has also said it is ready to release moreland for sale to ward off a possible property bubble. This weekit announced its first large-scale land sale in two years. On Friday the government announced that property developerswould have to make public their sales transactions ofuncompleted first-hand residential property within five workingdays rather than one month from the end of November, saying itwanted to improve transparency in the market. Developers must also show an apartment's price per squarefoot/metre in 'saleable area' under the new rules, not just theoverall apartment price, as the government said it was "deeplyconcerned" about some recent sales tactics. Chan said it was not easy to say whether Hong Kong was nowseeing an asset bubble but warned that values risked deviatingfrom fundamentals. Massive fund flows into the city's banking system have putintense upward pressure on the Hong Kong dollar , forcingthe HKMA to intervene repeatedly to keep the currency withinits trading band against the U.S. dollar. The HKMA has injecteda record HK$620 billion since October 2008. In nearby South Korea, officials have also warned of therisk of a housing bubble and have threatened to raise interestrates from a record low 2 percent to calm prices.
