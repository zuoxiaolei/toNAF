<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro edged higher against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, to trade close to a four-month high, as risk sentiment strengthened ahead of highly anticipated comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke later in the day.EUR/USD hit 1.2930 during late Asian trade, the daily high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2926, rising 0.21%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.2820, the low of May 14 and resistance at 1.3064, the high of May 8.Markets were eyeing the outcome of the Fed’s policy meeting later Thursday, amid speculation that the U.S. central bank may implement a third round of quantitative easing.The euro also remained supported after Germany’s constitutional court approved the country’s participation in the euro zone’s bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism on Wednesday.The ruling cleared the way for Germany’s president to ratify the ESM under certain conditions, allowing the European Central Bank’s bond purchasing program to proceed.The German court said that the country’s liability to the EMS must not exceed EUR190 billion without the approval of the lower house of parliament and said that both houses of parliament must be kept informed about decisions relating to the ESM.Elsewhere, the euro was higher against the pound with EUR/GBP adding 0.16%, to hit 0.8021.Later in the day, the ECB was to produce its monthly bulletin, while the U.S. was to publish government data on producer price inflation, as well as a weekly report on initial jobless claims. The Federal Reserve was to announce its benchmark interest rate, followed by comments by Chairman Ben Bernanke.             ]]></raw>
