<raw><![CDATA[  * S&P 500 and global shares up 2 percent * Stocks up on reports of impending Greece bank merger * Higher U.S. consumer spending data helps sentiment * Crude oil up 2 pct, rallying with Wall Street; gold down (Corrects first paragraph to show two major Greek banks inmerger, not Greece's top two banks) By Barani Krishnan NEW YORK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Global stocks rallied onMonday along with oil after news of a merger between two majorbanks in Greece suggested that Europe was working through itsfinancial problems. Surprisingly strong U.S. consumer spending for July --which indicated the economy was not falling back into recession-- helped sentiment, although weak pending sales of existinghomes mitigated this somewhat. For more see [ID:N1E77S0BS]. However, trading volumes across markets were lighter thanusual as New York City struggled to return to work after theweekend's flooding and power outages, including in the WallStreet district, from Tropical Storm Irene. [ID:nN1E77R061] The closure of London markets for a holiday further crimpedactivity. U.S. crude oil futures  rose about 2 percent,extending gains from Friday, after Federal Reserve Chairman BenBernanke left the door open last week for further action tostimulate the U.S. economy and fight unemployment [O/R]. Spotgold  fell 2 percent as investors moved away fromsafe-havens to embrace riskier assets like oil. The dollar edged 0.3 percent lower against a basket ofmajor currencies  [USD/]. U.S. Treasuries prices fell asinvestors reduced their bids for bonds in favor of stocks,although bond market volume was very light in early New Yorktrading, according to data from ICAP. [US/] Shortly after 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), Wall Street's DowJones industrial average  was up 154.69 points, or 1.37percent, at 11,439.23. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 20.08 points, or 1.71 percent, at 1,196.88. The NasdaqComposite Index  was up 49.21 points, or 1.98 percent,at 2,529.06. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  wasdown 21/32, with the yield at 2.2641 percent. GREEK DEAL The run-up in stocks was largely due to the merger betweenEurobank  and Alpha Bank , the second- andthird-largest banks in Greece. "We've actually started putting cash to work," said KeithWirtz, chief investment officer at Fifth Third AssetManagement, with $18 billion in assets. "A few things (are)helping the stock market -- there's relief coming from thestorm and Europe, particularly with Greece." Troubled by rating downgrades, deposit outflows and loanimpairments in the wake of the country's worst recession infour decades, Greek bank shares have tumbled more than 55percent in the year to date. The tie-up between Eurobank andAlpha Bank thus signals a move in the right direction, analystssaid. [ID:nLDE77Q03M] "The deal is about a friendly merger between Alpha Bank andEurobank, with the participation to a significant extent of theQatar Investment Authority," which is already a shareholder inAlpha, a banking source told Reuters. Shares of U.S. insurers were also higher in Monday's earlytrading due to less-than-feared property damage from theweekend storm. World shares  rose 2.1 percent and Europeanstocks  1.6 percent, partly on speculation that theUnited States might resort to another round of monetary easing,as indicated in Friday's speech by Fed Chairman Bernanke. Bernanke, in his annual address to central bankers atJackson Hole, Wyoming, gave no details on whether the Fed wasplanning to flood markets with more dollars to help theeconomy. But he said the central bank's policy panel would meetfor two days next month instead of one to discuss additionalmonetary stimulus, offering hopes of a move then.[ID:nN1E77R0GB] Some analysts think it may be hard for Bernanke and the Fedto follow through with another round of bond buying after the$600 billion program that expired in June. "He (Bernanke) has a much, much harder decision this time,"Jim Walker, founder of Asianomics, told Reuters television. "What he's got to do is convince the dissenting voices inthe Fed -- and there are now three of them -- that economicgrowth is so bad that it is time to use even more extraordinarymeasures."* For Reuters Global Investing Blog, click on http://blogs.reuters.com/globalinvesting* For the MacroScope Blog, click on http://blogs.reuters.com/macroscope * For Hedge Fund Blog, click on http://blogs.reuters.com/hedgehub (Additional reporting by Patrick Graham, Neal Armstrong andSimon Jessup; Editing by James Dalgleish and Dan Grebler)             ]]></raw>
