<raw><![CDATA[ * Hungary's programme, policies on track-IMF * Improving fiscal sustainability remains key-IMF * IMF says rate cuts should be gradual, cautious  (Adds more IMF comments, Aug budget data) By Krisztina Than and Gergely Szakacs BUDAPEST, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Hungary has met the terms ofits IMF/EU loan and has reached agreement with the Fund toextend access to its existing loan package by six months untilOctober 2010, Finance Minister Peter Oszko said on Monday. The International Monetary Fund, which along with the EU andthe World Bank lent Hungary $25.1 billion last October to avertfinancial meltdown, had completed its third review of thecountry's performance and said the programme remained on track. It said the extension of the current financing package wasaimed to cover Hungary's parliamentary election period in 2010. Hungary is gradually trying to go back to financing its debtand deficit from the market and it successfully issued aEurobond in July after more than a year of absence frominternational debt markets. Oszko told Reuters earlier this month that the IMF/EU fundswill serve as a safety buffer next year, but the aim was toreturn to market financing [ID:nNYS005373] "Macroeconomic and financial policies in Hungary are ontrack," the IMF said in a statement on Monday. James Morsink, head of the IMF delegation visiting Budapest,told a news conference that Hungary's 2010 budget, which stillneeds to be passed by the government and parliament, had certainrisks but it contains adequate reserves to offset these risks. Finance Minister Oszko told the same news conference thatthe government maintained its forecast for a 6.7 percentcontraction in the economy this year and expects a further 0.9percent decline next year. Oszko said meeting the budget deficit targets this year andnext year was key, especially considering the uncertainty stillsurrounding the economic outlook. "Therefore we must make all efforts to ensure that thedeficits comply with the targets," Oszko said. Also on Monday data from the finance ministry showed thatHungary posted a budget deficit  of 97.7 billionforints ($513.9 million) in August, which brought the deficit ofthe first eight months to 92 percent of the full-year forecast. Oszko has said the government may need to freeze somereserves in the budget to meet this year's target of 3.9 percentof gross domestic product (GDP).  "The key objectives of the programme remain to improvefiscal sustainability and preserve the stability of thefinancial sector," the IMF said.  GRADUAL RATE CUTS The IMF and Hungarian authorities agreed that Hungary, whichhas drawn on about 14 billion euros from the package so far,will draw upon 55 million euros following this latest review andwill have access to the remainder of the financing in four equaltranches of about 800 million euros each. "We ... reached staff-level agreement to extend the SBA(Stand-by Arrangement) by six months (to October 5, 2010) tocover the election period and the transition to a newgovernment," the IMF said. Hungary will hold general elections in April or May 2010 andthe main opposition Fidesz party, which last ruled between 1998and 2002, is expected to win the elections with a wide margin. IMF's Morsink said the delegation met with MPs from Fideszand former finance minister Mihaly Varga and they had noobjections to the extension of the current stand-by agreement. Morsink also said interest rate cuts carried out by theHungarian central bank have been "appropriate" so far and saidthe bank should proceed with cautious, gradual rate cuts. The bank has cut its key base rate by a cumulative 150 basispoints in July and August, to 8.0 percent . (Reporting by Krisztina Than and Gergely Szakacs; Editing byAndy Bruce)             ]]></raw>
