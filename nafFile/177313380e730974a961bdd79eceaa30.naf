<raw><![CDATA[ * Fidesz has cemented powers ahead of Oct. 3 municipal vote * PM Orban faces two limits: financial markets and EU * 2011 budget in focus after local vote * EU presidency in 2011 next key challenge  By Krisztina Than BUDAPEST, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime MinisterViktor Orban has one of the strongest political mandates inEurope but he faces two constraints beyond his control:financial markets and the European Union. These two forces will continue to pose serious challenges toOrban, with the first big test after October municipal electionswhen his centre-right government will have to present a credible2011 budget to reassure investors. Investors and rating agencies will scrutinize this budget todecide whether to give his centre-right government the benefitof the doubt after it broke ties with the International MonetaryFund and baffled markets with confusing messages since April. If they are convinced the government is committed to deficitreduction and will put high public debt on a declining path,Hungary can escape a downgrade in its sovereign rating -- andthere is chance for a "virtuous circle" in which investor trustreturns and risk premia on Hungarian assets fall. Even then, risks will remain about the country's ability tofinance its debts from markets in coming years without an IMFsatefy net amid still fragile global investor sentiment. Orban, 47, whose Fidesz party won a historic two-thirdsmajority in parliament in April, is seen as a shrewd, pragmaticpolitician who is planning to stay in power beyond the nextgeneral elections, due in 2014. For this, he needs to put the economy firmly back on agrowth track and create jobs. "There are only two issues that are now posing barriers tohis powers: markets -- which he is trying to manipulate in amanner that I have never seen anywhere in Europe -- and theother very painful limit for him is the common EU decisions,"said an EU diplomat in Budapest. Since his April election landslide, the yield on Hungarian5-year bonds has risen 110 basis points to 6.8 percent, and theforint currency has fallen by 5.7 percent against the euro.However it had fallen as much as 11 percent at the height of thecrisis on July 19.  TIGHTENED GRIP Orban has tightened Fidesz's grip on key institutions, anddelivered on symbolic pledges such as easing cizitenship forethnic Hungarians in neighbouring states while giving littledetail on his fiscal plans. He tested markets' patience by seeking budget leeway toboost growth at a time when the EU is trying to rein in publicdeficits, and by pushing what some observers see as an "economicnationalist" agenda. Orban has favoured domestic firms, taxed banks heavily,lashed out at "speculators" and stood up to the IMF. His government has committed, reluctantly, to cutting thebudget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product nextyear under heavy pressure from the EU and a weakening forint. Hungary will be in the forefront of attention from Januarywhen it takes over the EU's rotating presidency with key budgetand economic issues on the agenda. But before that, the period after the October vote will becritical to show whether Orban will use his mandate to restorefiscal discipline and launch potentially painful reforms inhealthcare, local governments and at loss-making state firms. "The key to market financing rests with the government'sability to fill with credible detailed plans the recentlyannounced low deficit target," said Janos Samu, an analyst atConcorde in Budapest.  ON A MISSION Orban swept to power with a mission to make Hungary a strongeconomy again after eight years of Socialist rule, promising to cut taxes and create "one million jobs in 10 years". His Fidesz party has managed to maintain its big poll leadat around 60 percent among decided voters since April electionsand is expected to score a major win again in the local vote. But it has done so by saying different things to differentaudiences, promising voters it will regain financialindependence from lenders and ruling out austerity, while tryingto reassure markets with budget discipline pledges when needed. This confused markets and led to falls in the forint andbonds in June -- when some Fidesz officials likened Hungary'sfiscal situation to Greece -- and in July when Hungary's talkswith the IMF and EU unexpectedly collapsed."Fidesz seems to forget we are in a globalised world andevery word has an impact outside," another EU diplomat said."There are such tensions between the intention of regainingeconomic sovereignty and the small fiscal room of manoeuvre...that it's very difficult to build a consistent economicpolicy on that," added Peter Tolgyessy, a political analyst. Orban will have a tough task to meet fiscal targets and beefup the economy. For the time being, investors remain cautious. "The government, in principle, holds the power to... createa virtuous circle in which a stronger forint and lower riskpremium could remove the threat of rate hikes and allowgovernment bonds to rally," Barclays Capital said in a note. "However, there are many `ifs' in that equation." (Reporting by Krisztina Than; Editing by Paul Taylor)              ]]></raw>
