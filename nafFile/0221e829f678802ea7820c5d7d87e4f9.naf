<raw><![CDATA[ * Asia stocks fall 1 pct in light trade, techs outperform * Shanghai falls more than 5 pct, fallout limited * W.House to renominate Bernanke as Fed chief, littleimpact * Markets reverse moves from Monday, yen posts broad gains By Eric Burroughs HONG KONG, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Asian shares and commoditiesslipped on Tuesday in a partial reversal of the previous day'ssolid gains, but many investors stuck to the sidelines awaitingmore clues on whether the global economic recovery is pickingup steam. European shares were also poised for a retreat, withfutures on the Dow Jones Eurostoxx 50  down 0.9percent. The Shanghai Composite index  tumbled more than 5percent as cautious remarks from Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao onMonday stirred worries about the economic rebound in thecountry that has helped fuel recovery hopes in much of Asia. The latest slide in Shanghai was mainly driven by investorstaking advantage of the 7.5 percent bounce over the previousthree trading days to pull funds out, hitting bank shares thehardest. But the fallout from Chinese losses on other globalmarkets was limited, unlike slides seen last week. "In China's market, it's always those investers who eye anovernight fortune who take the lead in dumping shares when themarket becomes unstable," said a senior trader at Guotai JunanSecurities in Shanghai. "Generally speaking, their withdrawal will not result in aprolonged market slump, but it will often nevertheless keep themarket in a standstill for weeks, if not months." Investors showed little reaction to news that the WhiteHouse will tap U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke foranother term at the helm of the central bank. [ID:nBERNANKE] Analysts said the decision had been widely expected, butstill removed some uncertainty about the outlook for U.S.monetary policy and was neutral for U.S. assets and the dollar. Some analysts had said a decision not to reappoint Bernankewould have been a negative by risking politicising the Fedchief post at a time when investors are worried about recordU.S. deficits.  "When you look at responses to last year's financialcrisis, bold action was taken and the market reacted to thatfavourably," said Takahide Nagasaki, chief FX strategist atDaiwa Securities SMBC in Tokyo. "I don't think there will be any major impact, but itshould be positive for stock and bond markets in the sense thatan element of uncertainty has been removed." The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1 percent, with consumer discretionaryand health care stocks the bigger decliners. The index is stillup about 47 percent for the year and near an 11-month highstruck earlier in the month. Technology shares held up the best on hopes that frailconsumer demand is picking up heading into the key U.S.back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons. South Korea's LG Display <034220.KS> the world's No. 2 LCDpanel maker, recovered from early losses to rise 2.6 percentafter confirming it had signed a non-binding agreement to buildan LCD plant with the city of Guangzhou, China. [ID:nSEL000749][ID:nSEO42635] Share trading volumes were very light for a second dayrunning, leading to exaggerated moves across markets. Japan's Nikkei average  shed 0.8 percent afterjumping 3.4 percent the previous day, its biggest one-day gainin 3-Â½   months. Turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's firstsection slowed from the previous day to the lowest in fiveweeks. Foreign investors, which have been increasingly shovingfunds back into Japanese shares in the past few weeks, arekeeping an eye on Japan's Aug. 30 general election. With many expecting the opposition Democratic Party to winand end a half-century of nearly unbroken rule by the rulingcoalition, foreign buying of Japanese shares on a rollingone-month moving average has hit its highest levels sincemid-2007. [ID:nPOLJP] The dollar dipped against the yen and was down slightlyagainst a basket of currencies, with the yen rebounding after abroad slide the previous day as market players favoured riskierassets including higher-yielding currencies. The dollar shed 0.6 percent to 93.85 yen . TheAustralian dollar, the highest-yielding of major currencies,dipped 0.5 percent to $0.8336  and dropped about 1percent to 78.25 yen . "The lack of upward momentum in equities and riskycurrencies may reflect a degree of fatigue and simply a lot ofthe good news is in the price," said a trader at a Europeanbank in Tokyo. "It is pretty clear monetary policy will be supportive withlittle risk of genuine policy tightening for some time in themajor economies." Gold gained on the dollar's woes, rising $1.80 an ounce to$943.15 . But oil prices pulled back, losing 78 cents abarrel to $73.59  after reaching a 10-month high of$74.81 on Monday. Safe-haven government bonds popped higher on the retreat inshares and gains in U.S. Treasuries the previous day. September Japanese government bond futures <2JGBv1> edgedup 0.06 point to 138.97 and the benchmark 10-year JGB yield was flat at 1.325 percent, holding near afive-week low struck last week. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields  dipped abasis point to 3.464 percent.
