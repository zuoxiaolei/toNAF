<raw><![CDATA[ * More banks set to follow BNP, UniCredit in seeking cash * G20 offers capital clarity, puts focus on common equity * Europe banks only taken 40 pct of expected writedowns -IMF  By Steve Slater LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Pressure on Europe's banks tofollow a flurry of recent cashcalls intensified on Wednesday asthe IMF warned that the sector is less than halfway through itsexpected writedowns from the financial crisis. That estimate and a positive response to rights issues thisweek from BNP Paribas and UniCredit will have major banksconsidering modest cashcalls, bankers and analysts said. Clarity from world leaders that lenders will have time torebuild capital could encourage the trend, they said. The list of possible candidates includes BBVA, SocieteGenerale and Deutsche Bank, as well as Spain's Sabadell orBankinter, the bankers and analysts said. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated Europeanbank writedowns are expected to top $1.6 trillion by the end of2010, and British and eurozone banks were only 40 percentthrough their hits. U.S. banks are 60 percent through their expected $1 trillionwritedown, the IMF said.  European banks have also been criticised for lagging U.S.rivals in replenishing their capital this year. Since the start of the financial crisis, European banks haveraised $437 billion in Tier 1 capital, but that has been mostlyin hybrid capital such as preferred shares and subordinateddebt, according to the IMF. "On a system side basis, banks exceed minimum capitallevels, but would benefit from additional tangible capital tobetter absorb impending losses and revive lending," it said. G20 leaders meeting in Pittsburgh on Friday signalled banksneeded more common equity, but could phase that in over the nexttwo years, removing the risk of a step change in capital needs. "The risk was that regulators would have imposed a morestringent timeframe (to rebuild capital)," an equity capitalmarkets banker said.he said. BNP is raising 4.3 billion euros from its rights issue andUnicredit followed hours later with plans to raise 4 billioneuros. The rationale for BNP's and UniCredit's fundraisings toreplace costly support from government was welcomed byinvestors, and they and Norway's DnB NOR -- which last weekunveiled a $2.4 billion rights issue -- have benefited from arevival in equity markets, allowing them to limit the dilutionof their offers. SocGen is the obvious candidate to follow BNP and could need2.4 billion to 4 billion euros to increase its equity Tier 1ratio to 7.5-8 percent, according to analysts at Credit Suisse. Part-nationalised British banks Lloyds and Royal Bank ofScotland are considering multi-billion pound rights issues, butthe threat that Europe's competition chief will force them tosell assets will make any quick cash calls difficult, analystssaid.
