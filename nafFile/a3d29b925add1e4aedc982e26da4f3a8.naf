<raw><![CDATA[ BRUSSELS, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The euro zone economycontracted only marginally in the second quarter against theprevious three months, data confirmed on Wednesday, dragged downby a plunge in inventories and private investment. The European Union statistics office Eurostat confirmed itsearlier estimate that the gross domestic product of the 16countries using the euro fell 0.1 percent quarter-on-quarterafter a 2.5 percent drop in the first three months of 2009. "The worst is over for the time being," the chairman of eurozone finance ministers, Jean-Claude Juncker, told reportersbefore they met in Brussels with the European Central Bank. Second-quarter GDP in the euro area was 4.7 percent lowerthan a year earlier, after a 4.9 percent fall in the firstquarter. A plunge in inventories was the single biggest negativefactor in the second quarter, subtracting 0.7 percentage pointfrom the overall quarterly result. A fall in private investmenttook away another 0.3 percentage point. Household consumption and government spending added 0.1percentage point each to the final outcome and trade contributed0.7 percentage point as imports plunged much more than exports. Economists believe the relatively small second-quarter fallmeans the euro zone could emerge from recession in the thirdquarter, especially as its two biggest economies, Germany andFrance, returned to growth in the April-June period. The depleted inventories will have to be rebuilt, boostingproduction, while some economic revival globally is likely toboost demand for euro zone exports. Separately, Eurostat said prices at factory gates in theeuro zone fell 0.8 percent month-on-month in July for an 8.5percent year-on-year drop.  Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.6 percentmonthly fall and an 8.4 percent annual decline. The fall in producer prices, triggered mainly by lessexpensive oil, shows how weak inflationary pressures are in theeuro zone.
