<raw><![CDATA[ * No timetable for free trade pacts with Colombia, Panama * Report recommends increasing U.S. trade missions abroad By Jeff Mason WASHINGTON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The Obama administrationlaid out details of a strategy to double U.S. exports over fiveyears on Thursday, recommending ways to boost commerce butsteering clear of timetables for advancing stalled free-tradeagreements. The release of the National Export Initiative report,produced by President Barack Obama's "export promotion cabinet"of top advisers and government agencies, sought to highlightthe administration's efforts to support the struggling economyand create jobs, the top issue ahead of Nov. 2 elections. "Exports are actually leading our economic recovery,"Commerce Secretary Gary Locke told reporters on a conferencecall ahead of the report's release, noting exports were uproughly 18 percent over the same period last year. "The more that American companies export, the more theyproduce. The more they produce, the more people they hire. Andthat means more jobs," he said. U.S. officials said opening markets and enforcing existingtrade pacts were part of the process of increasing exports. Butthe report did not lay out a timeline for wrapping upfree-trade pacts with Colombia and Panama. Obama has said he wants to resolve outstanding concernsover a free-trade agreement with South Korea by November so hecan submit it to Congress by early next year. "On Panama and Colombia, (Obama) has similarly said that wehope to be able to resolve the outstanding issues and bringthem forward whenever that's feasible," White House deputynational security adviser Michael Froman said on the call. "The report does not specify a timetable beyond that." Obama has made expanding trade a priority among his limitedtools to jumpstart economic growth and battle nearlydouble-digit unemployment, factors that could cost hisDemocrats their majorities in one or both houses of Congress inNovember elections. U.S. exports would need to grow from $1.57 trillion in 2009to $3.14 trillion by 2015 to meet Obama's goal of doubling overfive years, the report said.The report's recommendations include: * An "outreach campaign" to raise awareness among small andmedium sized companies about export opportunities and availablegovernment assistance. * Implementing a "government-wide export promotionstrategy" for markets in Colombia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia,South Africa, Turkey and Vietnam. * Increasing U.S. trade missions abroad. * Bringing more international buyers to U.S. trade showsand boosting participation of U.S. companies in internationaltrade shows.
