<raw><![CDATA[ * Commodity sector boosts Asia stocks to 2-year high * Japan's Nikkei up 2 pct, driven by short covering * Asia braces for more capital inflows post Fed * US bond yields in 5-7-year segment fall By Kevin Plumberg HONG KONG, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose to theirhighest levels since June 2008 and commodity prices rallied onThursday after the Federal Reserve's new bond-buying programmekept the hunt on for growth and higher yields. European stock futures were up across the board, with theSTOXX Europe 50 futures up 1.1 percent  in early trade. Japanese equities rose 2 percent and led the region afterfears of a much stronger yen in the wake of the Fed decisionwere eased by a moderate market reaction, prompting foreigninvestors to cover their bets against stocks. After falling overnight, the U.S. dollar stabilised, withdealers hesitant to add to sizable bets against the currencyafter the euro touched a 10-month high, though traders pushedup copper and oil prices anyway. There was still a plethora of events coming up this weekthat could inject volatility into asset markets, includingpolicy meetings of the Bank of England, Bank of Japan andEuropean Central Bank as well as the October U.S. payrollsreport.                           http://link.reuters.com/buf27p For a FACTBOX on policymaker reaction to the Fed, click                                     [ID:nN03131287]  For Asia, after the Fed pledged to buy $600 billion ofmostly mid-maturity Treasury debt, increased capital flows intothe region will probably accelerate a process of reflation butalso heighten the risk of more stringent capital controls. "By undertaking more Treasury bond purchases, the hope isthat risk appetite will provide the catalyst for people tospend, particularly corporates," Sean Darby, Asia strategistwith Nomura in Hong Kong, said in a note. "We expect Asian equities to remain well bid but theadditional QE will raise the spectre of capital controls inASEAN and parts of North Asia." Japan's Nikkei share average was up 1.9 percent ,with shares of big exporters among the biggest lifts to theindex after the yen sold off overnight. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose1.1 percent , led by the commodity andtechnology sectors. Since September when speculation grew the Fed would have toprint more cheap money and a chunk of those dollars would cometo high-growth Asia, the index has risen 19 percent, exceedingreturns on the MSCI all-country world index of 15 percent. Hong Kong's stock market remained electric this week, withthe Hang Seng up 1 percent on the day  and extendinggains so far this week to 5.6 percent compared with returns of3.6 percent on the MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index. COPPER, CRUDE OIL GAIN In currency markets, many dealers did not want to upset aweak U.S. dollar trend already in place before the Fed meeting,but quickly found other themes on which to trade. The Canadian dollar was a big mover, with the U.S. dollarclimbing 0.2 percent to C$1.0066 after the Canadian governmentsurprised markets by blocking BHP Billiton's  $39 billion bid for Potash Corp . [ID:nN03272751] The euro was at $1.4130 , largely unchanged on theday, after hitting a high around $1.4175 on Wednesday. Some investors were beginning to reassess the risks ofkeeping such negative bets on the dollar after the Fed decisionwas largely in line with expectations. For example, fund managers at Edmond de Rothschild AssetManagement said they were maintaining their short euro versusthe dollar position after the Fed news. "After rallying so strongly in the recent past, riskyassets might inspire more caution. This would benefit the USDand provide overall protection for our positions," the firmsaid in a note. Economic reflation trades were rampant in the commoditiesmarket, with three-month copper traded on the London MetalExchange up 1.4 percent to $8,440.00 a tonne , creepingback toward a two-year high reached last week. Crude prices were poised for a fourth day of gains, up 1percent on the day at $85.53 a barrel . Ten-year U.S. Treasury futures rose 0.5 percent to aone-month high , while in the cash market, 5-yearTreasury yields  slipped 3 basis points to 1.08percent, with 43 percent of the Fed's new plans for bond buyingfalling between 4 and 7 year maturities.
