<raw><![CDATA[ * Russia needs US backing to join WTO after 17 years' trying * White House wants Senate vote, but faces delays  By Conor Humphries MOSCOW, Dec 15 (Reuters) - U.S. politics may again delayRussia's accession to the World Trade Organisation as the WhiteHouse struggles to get Congress to repeal Cold War trade rules,the head of the top U.S. business lobby in Russia said. A U.S.-Russia bilateral deal is one of the last hurdles toRussian membership in the WTO, which sets the parameters forglobal trade. Russia, the largest economy outside the WTO, hassaid it hopes to join within months. But U.S. Republicans trying to claw back the legislativeagenda after mid-term election gains could stall the bilateraldeal by refusing to scrap the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment, thehead of the American Chamber of Commerce in Moscow told Reuters. "The administration would like assurances from Congress thatif the president signs the WTO agreement, that Congress willsimultaneously or shortly thereafter... abrogate Jackson-Vanikas it applies to Russia," Andrew Somers said an interview. The White House needs Congress to repeal Jackson-Vanikbefore Russia joins the WTO, because failure to do so wouldprevent U.S. companies from enjoying the Russian tariffreductions that membership would bring, he said. The White House is unlikely to push Jackson-Vanik untilhigher priority legislation is passed, such as ratification ofthe New START nuclear arms treaty with Russia and other tradedeals, Somers said. Delays to them would delay WTO too, he said. Speaking on Tuesday after several days of talks withadministration officials in Washington, he said the White Houseappeared quietly confident that the legislative logjam in theSenate was starting to clear, opening the way for a WTO deal. Democrats said on Tuesday that Senate consideration of STARTcould begin this week, raising the prospect that it could beratified during the current "lame duck" session, before thenewly elected Congress starts work next month.  GEOPOLITICS TRUMPS TRADE But Somers said Republicans may use discussion ofJackson-Vanik to register broad concerns about Russia givenaccusations that President Barack Obama is being too soft on theKremlin. "There are several politicians who have said we're going tomake this an issue on Russia, not on the economic issues. Humanrights, threats to neighbours, these kind of issues will beraised by those who fear Russia. They will try to steer thedebate away from the economics and toward the geopolitics." Jackson-Vanik tied normal trade relations with the SovietUnion to the right of Jews and other religious minorities toemigrate freely. Russia has been in compliance since 1994. Russia has long railed against the amendment, which PrimeMinister Vladimir Putin last year described as an anachronismused "to help solve narrow, selfish ... problems". Somers predicted Jackson-Vanik would be repealed bymid-2011, with Russia gaining WTO membership late next year. But if the U.S. administration fails to dispose ofJackson-Vanik by next summer, the political equation will startto change as 2012 presidential elections approach in both Russiaand the United States, shifting priorities. The trade issues, which U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirksaid last week were 95 percent solved, are less likely to delayWTO, Somers said, citing signs that Georgia, a U.S. ally thatcould block Russian membership, is more open to a deal. The Kremlin, seeking to reduce Russian reliance on naturalresources, says WTO membership would improve access to globalmarkets for its goods. The World Bank has estimated that Russia,by entering the WTO, could increase gross domestic product by asmuch as 11 percent in the long term. But Somers said the main benefit would be a boost toRussia's image among U.S. investors and multinationals. "It's really more the geopolitics than tariffs. Business inthe U.S. feels that once Russia is in the WTO it will be moreopen to world trade, more open to investment," he said. WTO entry, combined with the Kremlin's drive to modernizeRussia's economy, could double U.S. trade and investment inRussia over five years, said Somers. But the impetus behind the deal for Obama is afarther-reaching wish to anchor Russia-U.S. relations just asthey have created a foundation for U.S.-China ties, he said.
