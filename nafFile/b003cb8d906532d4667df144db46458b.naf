<raw><![CDATA[   * Euro touches 2-month high versus dollar * ECB holds rates, sees uneven growth going forward * U.S. initial jobless benefits claims fell in latest week * Aussie jumps vs yen, dlr after jobs data beats forecasts (Adds comments, details; changes dateline, previous LONDON,byline) By Vivianne Rodrigues NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month highagainst the dollar on Thursday as U.S. and Australian economicdata restored faith in the global economic recovery and boostedappetite for higher yielding currencies. New claims for U.S. unemployment insurance fell more thanexpected last week and several top U.S. retail chains reportedstronger June same-store sales, supporting demand for stocksand other higher-risk assets. and A jump in Australian employment in June drove theAustralian dollar up more than 1 percent on the day against thedollar and nearly 2 percent higher against the yen. Clarity on European bank stress tests helped financialstocks as investors saw criteria for the checks were no worsethan markets expected. "The euro continued to be supported by the overall elevatedlevel of risk appetite," said Omer Esiner, a chief marketanalyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington, D.C."That got a little bit of a boost from this morning's positiveinitial jobless claims data." "Global stocks are in broadly positive territory andcommodities are pushing higher, so you would expect the euro torun up further against the U.S. dollar in that environment," headded. The Australian dollar and other so-called commoditycurrencies, such as the Canadian dollar as well as the euro,are often seen as a gauge for investors' demand for riskierassets. The euro climbed to as high as $1.2700, its highest sincemid-May, according to Reuters data. It was last up 0.3 percentat $1.2669. The European Central Bank earlier kept interest rates at arecord low 1.0 percent at its monthly meeting. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said at a pressconference the economic recovery in the euro area continued inthe first half of 2010. Looking ahead, he expected the euroarea economy to grow "at a moderate and still uneven pace in anenvironment of high uncertainty." Trichet offered few details on whether the upcoming stresstests will effectively gauge the health of European banks. Thepresident reiterated his calls for full transparency of theresults and said complete disclosure would boost confidenceamong investors. Details on the test will be disclosed later this month. Further declines in the U.S. dollar are likely, accordingto the International Monetary Fund. The greenback willdepreciate in value "moderately" over the next five years, theFund predicted on Thursday. AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR RALLIES The Australian dollar was 2.6 percent higher versus the yenat 76.75 yen, on the back of data showing Australia created45,900 jobs in June, much higher than forecasts for 17,500. Itrose around 1 percent on the day against the dollar to$0.8731. The yen was one of the day's biggest losers as gains inEuropean and U.S. stocks prompted investors to shed longpositions in the low-yielding currency. The dollar rose 0.9 percent to 88.53 yen, while the eurorose 1.3 percent against the Japanese currency to 112.32. Sterling slipped 0.2 percent to $1.5152, pulling away froma two-month high of $1.5241 after an early rally triggered anunwinding of some long positions. It barely moved after the Bank of England kept interestrates unchanged at a record low 0.5 percent, as widelyexpected.(Additional reporting by Wanfeng Zhou in New York; Editingby Andrew Hay)             ]]></raw>
