<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds Merkel reaction) By Noah Barkin BERLIN, Aug 11 (Reuters) - German chancellor candidateFrank-Walter Steinmeier urged the British government on Tuesdaynot to bow to the City of London and backtrack on reform ofglobal financial rules at a G20 summit in Pittsburgh next month. Speaking at a Berlin news conference aimed at rejuvenatinghis struggling campaign to unseat Chancellor Angela Merkel,Steinmeier said he feared countries could use the nascentrecovery in markets and the economy as an excuse to drop reformsagreed at prior G20 summits. "The improvement in the economy has clouded the view that weneed to continue to work on the causes of this crisis,"Steinmeier, a member of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD),told reporters. "As soon as signs of a recovery emerge, the readiness todecisively implement agreements reached in Washington and Londonrecedes. I hope that we don't experience another setback inPittsburgh." Steinmeier's SPD trails Merkel's conservatives by doubledigits in opinion polls before the Sept. 27 election and he hasbeen criticised for a lacklustre campaign. Steinmeier singled out Britain for criticism, echoing hisparty colleague, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck, and Merkelherself, who cautioned last month against allowing bankers inNew York and London to dictate policy. "I don't know what the position of the British governmentwill be, but one hears voices of resistance from the City ofLondon, where the financial markets are currently beingrediscovered," Steinmeier said. "I hope this will not have a decisive influence on theposition of the British government in Pittsburgh. But if you areseeing signs of backsliding you are not mistaken."  TRAILING IN POLLS Last week he unveiled a plan to create 4 million new jobs inGermany over the next decade, but was hit by criticism fromother parties that his "10-year plan" was reminiscent ofcommunist economic programmes in the former East Germany. He defended the programme on Tuesday and accused Merkel'sconservatives of lacking an employment plan of their own -- acriticism she rejected later in the day. "What I don't think is good is to play games with numbersthat are impossible to forecast," she told RTL television,referring to the job creation plan. "As politicians we should have ambitious goals. But weshouldn't promise things we can't be sure of," Merkel added. Steinmeier's task has been complicated by the fact that heis also foreign minister in Merkel's current "grand coalition"government. This has made him more reluctant openly to criticise Merkel,who has shifted her own party to the left, capturing centristvoters who may have supported the SPD in the past. Steinmeier warned against reading too much into his party'sflagging poll numbers, estimating that 60 percent of Germans hadyet to decide who they would vote for or even whether they wouldgo to the polls next month. "I am telling you, this election is not decided," he said. (Writing by Noah Barkin, editing by Tim Pearce)             ]]></raw>
