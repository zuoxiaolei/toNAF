<raw><![CDATA[ * Airbus faces uphill task to cancel A400M loss via exports * Juggling leaner exportable version against financial goalsBy Matthias Blamont PARIS, March 23 (Reuters) - Airbus may come under pressureto offer a low-cost version of the A400 military airlifter tomeet ambitious export goals but it's unlikely to sell enough ofthe planes to erase heavy domestic losses. The dilemma looks set to extend the agony over the costcrisis on Europe's biggest defence project to the world stage. Torn between paying off losses and loans on Europeanproduction and selling the plane at a competitive price, theplanemaker seems doomed to build the plane for free for manyyears to come -- even after receiving a government bailout. "By all accounts the A400M is technically superior in manyways. But you also have to wonder whether it is overloaded withspecifications," said Virgine Vacca, a defence industry analystat Standard & Poor's Equity Research. "The specifications were essentially designed by France,Germany and Britain. It is not certain that many countries onthe export market have the means to pay for the same ambitions.Another risk is that it will arrive too late to seize marketopportunities, especially in the Middle East and Africa." After delays and overspending, Airbus parent EADS won aprovisional 3.5-billion-euro bailout for the military transportproject from seven European launch nations this month, including1.5 billion which must be paid back from exports. The A400M was designed to exploit a gap between the veteranLockheed Martin C-130 Hercules and the larger jet-powered Boeing C-17, both of which are older planes. Powered by the West's largest turbo-prop engines, theEuropean competitor is designed to lift 32 tonnes compared withthe Hercules's payload of 21 tonnes and the C-17's 75 tonnes. Pricing the plane depends on the payload, range and mission.  PRICE DILEMMA Military transport is broadly divided into two types ofmission -- transporting heavy loads internationally to thetheatre of operations, or strategic airlift, and ferrying troopsand smaller loads within the battle zone: the tactical sortie. Since the end of the Cold War and the rise of terrorism andirregular warfare, many armies plan for rapid deployments overlonger distances, landing closer to where force is needed. The burly A400M, nicknamed the "grizzly" by its test pilots,can carry two attack helicopters or 116 troops, or a large cranefor earthquake relief, into battle or disaster zones. Airbussays this allows it to combine strategic and tactical roles. But the list of countries packing a strategic punch remainsa relatively tight club and analysts say the bulk of the exportmarket may be weighted towards the tactical end of the spectrum,replacing the C-130J which currently sells for $60-100 million. The need to grab this business has led to calls in Europeandefence circles for a cheaper, simpler "A400M Lite" for export. Yet on paper, Airbus would need to charge prices closertowards the C-17's estimated overseas price tag of $250 millionin order to remove the lead weight of domestic losses. Thenumber of countries willing to pay such prices is quite small. The acid test will be an export campaign which Airbus plansto start in the second half of 2010. It projects 500 exportsincluding 200 for the United States, the backyard of its rivals. Although the plane plugs a size gap in the market, Airbusfaces multiple financial headwinds in making exports profitable. It must repay 1.5 billion euros of export aid from the sevenEuropean launch nations in the form of royalties. It must aborbits own losses which currently stand at 4.2 billion euros. Andit faces currency risk against the dollar, the main currency ofthe global arms market, just as it does on civil jetliner sales. According to a rough calculation without taking into accountinterest rates or specifications, Airbus would have a job makingthe A400M profitable at a mid-way price between rival models,even if it took 100 percent of the addressable market for itscategory, which Airbus estimates at 700 aircraft. (See table) That could leave it one last card to play to end the 28-yearA400M saga with a profit -- maintenance and repairs. Theseusually bring in cash far outstripping the ticket price ofmilitary planes. But some A400M nations have talked of poolingwork to cut costs and the top buyer, Germany, wants its airlineLufthansa to be given a chance to bid for the some of the work. Repairing the transport aircraft profitably could be just aschallenging as repairing the planemaker's tarnished reputation.  NUMBERS GAME The following table is a rough guide to export margins. The first part of the table sets out the financial headwindper plane, representing loan repayments and recovery of pastlosses depending on the volume sold. The second translates the resulting export breakeven priceinto a margin based on various possible export price levels.
