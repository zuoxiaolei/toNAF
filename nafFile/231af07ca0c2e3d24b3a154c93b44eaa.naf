<raw><![CDATA[ (Repeats to additional clients) * Dollar rebounds, stocks trim gains * U.S. data reinforces expectations of Fed easing * Investors await G20 meeting, earnings reports * Caterpillar, other U.S. companies report upbeat results (Updates with more on G20) By Manuela Badawy NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded fromearlier losses on Thursday amid questions about the extent ofthe Federal Reserve's economic stimulus measures, while worldstocks pared gains in tandem with the U.S. currency'sturnabout. U.S. data on jobless claims and regional business activityreinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will provideanother round of stimulus to boost the economy. New U.S. claims for unemployment benefits fell more thanexpected last week but not enough to suggest much improvementin the labor market, while the Philadelphia Federal ReserveBank's October business conditions index rose less thanexpected. The data "means that the Fed still has some work to do.They need to take some more precautions against the downsiderisk to the economy," said Mark Vitner, senior economist atWells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. The dollar's volatility came just ahead of Friday andSaturday meetings in South Korea of the Group of 20 finance andcentral bank chiefs, who will try to hammer out an agreement tomanage currency, trade and macroeconomic imbalances. China's latest data showed its economy was far fromoverheating, suggesting Beijing's rate hike this week may beenough for now to placate trading partners demanding a strongeryuan to reduce trade imbalances. [ID:nTOE69K00X] U.S. earnings remained in the spotlight, with CaterpillarInc  reporting strong quarterly results and raising itsfull-year revenue forecast. [ID:nN18273532] The Dow Jones industrial average  advanced 37.69points, or 0.34 percent, to 11,145.66 -- sharply off itssession high at 11,213.54. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 2.00 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,180.17, belowits session high at 1,189.43. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 1.36 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,458.76, alsowell off its session high at 2,482.14. Stocks generally advanced, renewing a rally that has beenunder way since September. The MSCI all-country world index  was up0.09percent on the day with its emerging market component leading the way, up 0.35 percent. MSCI's emergingmarket index has gained 12 percent this year. European stocks rallied, ending at their highest closinglevel in six months, propelled by a batch of upbeat quarterlyresults from bellwethers such as Nokia . TheFTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares ended0.6 percent at 1,093.24, the index's highest close since lateApril. DOLLAR VOLATILITY Currency volatility rippled through markets after commentsfrom U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner late on Wednesdayin which he said major currencies were in balance. The dollarjumped initially but the rally faded as investors focused onthe impact of a renewal of quantitative easing by the Fed. But the size, shape and timing of the Fed's move have leftinvestors guessing, and nearly two months of speculation hasgiven them plenty of time to sell the dollar, pushing it toextreme levels against some major currencies. "Since it is clear that the direction is toward anexpansion of quantitative easing (in the United States), it ishard to expect a sustained rebound in the dollar," said TaisukeTanaka, FX strategist at Nomura Securities in Tokyo. By midday, though, the dollar had managed a modest reboundagainst the euro and a basket of major currencies. A G20 source, with direct knowledge of meetingdeliberations, said G20 officials are unlikely to reach anaccord rejecting currency devaluations and capping currentaccount balances. The source made the comment after U.S.proposals ran into stiff opposition from several countries,including India and China. The euro  was down 0.2 percent at $1.3932 against thedollar as investors sold some euros in volatile trading. The U.S. Dollar Index  was up 0.28 percent at 77.385from a previous session close of 77.171. Against the Japaneseyen, the dollar  was up 0.16 percent at 81.26 from aprevious session close of 81.120. The U.S. currency has lost more than 10 percent againstmajor currencies over the past four months. While traders were far from convinced that G20 minsterswould solve once and for all their exchange-rate disagreementsat a weekend meeting, some said there was reluctance to takeextreme positions one way or the other. "There's so much uncertainty, and I really think we'll seea lot of position jockeying ahead of the weekend," said GregSalvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting. "Iwouldn't be surprised to see some dollar strength ahead." U.S. government debt prices slipped on light volume astraders await the Fed's decision. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  wasdown 12/32, with the yield at 2.525 percent. The 2-year U.S.Treasury note  was down 1/32, with the yield at0.3588 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  wasdown 17/32, with the yield at 3.922 percent. In energy and commodities markets, crude oil  fell$2.00, or 2.4 percent, to $80.54 per barrel following anotherbuild in U.S. crude oil stocks last week, and spot goldfell $14.50, or 1.08 percent, to $1,330.80 an ounce.
