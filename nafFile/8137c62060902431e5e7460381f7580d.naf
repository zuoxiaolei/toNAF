<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro recovers from 1-yr low vs dlr, Greece asks to tap aid * Strong German, euro zone data helps euro recovery * Market remains negative on euro, more losses seen (Releads, updates throughout)  By Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, April 23 (Reuters) - The euro pulled back from aone-year low against the dollar on Friday as Greece gave in tomarket pressure and asked to trigger an aid package from theEuropean Union and International Monetary Fund. Prime Minister George Papandreou said it was imperativeGreece, whose debt problems have weighed on the euro all year,seek to activate the aid mechanism. The euro was last at $1.3308, up 0.1 percent on the day. It hit a one-year low of $1.3201 earlier in the session,hammered after a downgrade of Greece's sovereign rating onThursday piled pressure on Athens to tap the aid, worth 40-45billion euros. Faith in Greece's ability to service its debts has graduallyevaporated this week, pushing the cost of insuring against adebt default to a record high and widening spreads between Greekand German government debt yields to levels not seen for atleast 12 years. "There's a lot of fear in the market, so if indeed theyreach some sort of solution it will be near-term supportive foreuro sentiment," said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist atSociete Generale. He said the euro may jump as high as $1.3415 in a knee-jerkreaction to any announcement of imminent help for Greece, butadded that any corrective rally would be fleeting. "We still don't know what the IMF would require for itsparticipation in an aid package ... there's still someuncertainty (surrounding the issue)." The euro also recovered from early losses against the yenand traded little changed on the day at 124.30. Citing a risk of higher Greek debt yields, Moody's InvestorsService on Thursday cut Greece's rating by one notch to A3,placing it four notches above "junk status". Greece's debt problems have emphasised the weak fiscalpositions of other euro zone countries, leaving some investorsquestioning the stability of the 16-nation currency bloc. The single currency has fallen more than 1 percent againstthe dollar so far this week, hit a three-month low againststerling, and tumbled to its weakest versus the Canadian dollarsince mid-2001. Worries about Greece have stung demand for risky assets andboosted the dollar, considered a safe bet in uncertain times.Against a currency basket, the greenback hit a one-month high of82.074 before pulling back to 81.620.  GREECE VS DATA A surge in German business morale this month to its highestin nearly two years also helped the euro, as did a bigger-than-expected jump in euro zone industrial new orders in February. But analysts said the market would be primarily driven byfallout from the Greek crisis. "It's not economic fundamentals but the euro zoneperipheries, especially Greece, that's going to weigh on themarket," said Ian Stannard, currency strategist at BNP Paribas. Analysts said revised data on Greece's 2009 budget deficitreleased on Thursday indicating the shortfall was wider thanfirst thought, suggested Greece may face an even harder timeconsolidating its debts. Forecasters in a Reuters poll, issued before Greece said itwould seek to trigger the aid mechanism, saw a roughly one-in-four chance the country would default on its debt in the nextfive years. The Australian dollar fell as much as 1 percent to $0.9184 after the head of the Reserve Bank of Australia said interestrates were moving close to "average". Finance ministers from the Group of 20 economic powers begantalks in Washington on Thursday, where they were expected todiscuss ways to reform the financial sector.
