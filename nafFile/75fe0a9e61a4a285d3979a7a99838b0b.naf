<raw><![CDATA[ (Repeats to additional subscribers) * Mexican peso and Brazil's real lose 0.5 pct * Gains by Brazil's opposition party make traders nervous * Chile prepares for Thursday's interest rate decision (Adds comments, updates prices to close) By Samantha Pearson and Caroline Stauffer SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Yields onBrazil's interest rate futures contracts fell on Thursday asinvestors woke up to the possibility that opposition candidateJose Serra may soon be the country's next president. Until now, investors had been brushing off Brazil'selection as a "non-event" because ruling party candidate DilmaRousseff looked set to sail to an easy victory at the end ofthis month, bringing few changes to current policy. But the most recent opinion poll on Thursday, showing Serrais almost tied with Dilma, has caused a last-minute scramble ontrading floors. [ID:nN14103392] "If someone starts believing Serra will win he is going toprepare for tougher fiscal measures, which would allow interestrates to fall in the future," said Paulo Petrassi, a partner atBrazil's Leme Investimentos. The yield on the interest rate futures contract due inJanuary 2012 , the most widely traded, fell 9 basispoints to 11.25 percent from the previous session. While the election was the main driving force of the marketon Thursday, concerns about global growth were also oninvestors' minds, Petrassi said. RUSH TO TAKE PROFITS Weak data on U.S. jobless claims on Thursday added toconcerns about a slowdown in the world's biggest economy, alsocausing the region's currencies to weaken sharply. The Mexican peso and Brazilian real were further hit byprofit-taking after both currencies strengthened to key levelsin early trading. Mexico's peso weakened 0.5 percent to 12.4480. The pesoappreciated to the 12.35 level earlier in the session, whichtriggered a round of profit-taking that weakened the peso toits session low of 12.4757. The Chilean peso  traded flat for most of the morningbefore weakening 0.22 percent to 478.8 ahead of a central bankrate decision expected later in the day. Minutes of the central bank's September rate-settingmeeting released last week showed bank board members saw thepeso's recent appreciation possibly impacting monetary policy. "Specifically, the minutes mention both the appreciation ofCLP and falling inflation expectations as reasons to, at thatmeeting, adopt a slower pace of policy tightening," a reportfrom Nomura Securities said. The Brazilian real  also weakened, closing 0.48percent weaker at 1.661 per dollar in the local market. Traders were quick to take profits after the currency brokethrough the closely watched level of 1.65 reais per dollarearlier in the session. Recent election polls have also started to unnerveinvestors. As well as adopting a tougher fiscal stance, Serrais expected to take a more proactive role to weaken thecurrency and protect exporters. "Serra has clearly come out in favor of a weaker currencyhere," said Luciano Rostagno, chief strategist for CM CapitalMarkets in Sao Paulo.
