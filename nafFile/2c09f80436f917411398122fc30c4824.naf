<raw><![CDATA[ * C$ closes at C$1.0438 to US$, 95.80 U.S. cents * Hits high of C$1.0338 to US$, or 96.73 U.S. cents * Canada posts historic gain in jobs in April * Euro zone debt concerns keep C$ gains in check * Bond prices cool off as stability returns By Claire Sibonney TORONTO, May 7 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar bounced back onFriday from the three-month low it hit the day before, boostedby an April jobs report that showed record gains and put morepressure on the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates soon. Persistent fears of a market meltdown over Greece's debtcrisis kept the currency's rise in check, however. In a Reuters poll conducted after the employment figureswere released, all of Canada's primary securities dealers,undaunted by Europe's fiscal crisis, said they expect the Bankof Canada to start raising interest rates in June as theeconomy roars ahead,. [ID:nN07180411] All 12 dealers said the central bank would push its keyinterest rate 25 basis points higher from the current ultra-low0.25 percent.  Currencies usually strengthen as interest rates rise ashigher rates attract capital flows. "It's going to take a fair bit more volatility I imagine inglobal markets to dissuade the money markets here from the viewthat the bank has to tighten rates at some point in thenot-too-distant future," said Shaun Osborne, chief currencystrategist at TD Securities. "The economy appears to be firing very much on allcylinders at the moment...we're still very bullish on themedium-term outlook for the Canadian dollar and the specificshort-term outlook for the Canadian dollar on the crosses." The currency  rose to a session high of C$1.0338 tothe U.S. dollar, or 96.73 U.S. cents, from about C$1.0448, or95.71 U.S. cents, just before the jobs data's release. The euro also recovered from a 14-month low against theU.S. dollar as German lawmakers approved a rescue package forGreece while the greenback gained versus the yen after U.S.data showed employment grew at its fastest pace in four yearsin April. [FRX/] The Canadian currency finished the North American sessionat C$1.0438 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.80 U.S. cents, up fromits close on Thursday of C$1.0523 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.03U.S. cents. The currency was down 2.8 percent for the week, thesteepest weekly drop since October. Yields on overnight index swaps, which trade based onexpectations for the central bank's key policy rate, jumped onFriday, showing the market believed credit tightening was morelikely after the data than before.  Last month, the Bank of Canada took a first step towardtightening monetary policy by removing a commitment to keeprates at the rock-bottom 0.25 percent until the end of June. Weighing on Canada's commodity-linked and risk-sensitivecurrency was oil, which fell for a fourth day in a row,tracking a steep fall in North American stock market indexesdue to euro zone worries. [O/R] [.N] [.TO] On Thursday, the Canadian dollar hit its lowest level sinceearly February and had its steepest intraday drop since themarket crash of 2008 on heightened fears that Greece's debtcrisis may spread to other euro zone countries and threaten theeconomic recovery. As well, Thursday's mayhem across all markets led tospeculation about a massive errant trade. "(Parity with the U.S. dollar) has been put back for quitea while, and this just goes to show how quickly these thingscan change," said Carlos Leitao, chief economist at LaurentianBank of Canada in Montreal. "I think until, and unless, there is some more encouragingnews coming out of Europe, there will be downward pressure onthe Canadian dollar and upward pressure on the U.S. dollar." BOND PRICES WEAKER Canadian government bond prices slumped across the curve,after the strong domestic jobs data hinted at a higher rateenvironment.  Bond prices typically fall when interest rates go up astheir low-yielding fixed payments seems less lucrative comparedwith rising yields on other investments. The move down also tracked U.S. Treasures, which fell assafe-haven demand for bonds cooled with some stabilityreturning to Wall Street. The two-year government bond  slipped 5 Canadiancents to C$99.39 to yield 1.805 percent, while the 10-year bond dropped 15 Canadian cents to C$100.00 to yield3.500 percent.
