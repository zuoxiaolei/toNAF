<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds background, details) By Dave Graham BERLIN, Sept 8 (Reuters) - German exports increased for athird straight month in July, boosting the country's tradesurplus and fuelling hopes that a recovery in Europe's largesteconomy has gathered pace in the third quarter. Adjusted for seasonal swings, exports rose by 2.3 percentmonth-on-month in July to 68.4 billion euros, data from theFederal Statistics Office showed on Tuesday. With imports unchanged at 55.9 billion euros, the tradesurplus widened to 12.4 billion euros, the Office said. "These numbers are good. They offer further evidence thatthe worst is now over," said Commerzbank analyst Ralph Solveen. "The net contribution to growth from foreign trade willclearly be positive in the third quarter. We will have a decentthird quarter -- growth of 0.75 percent compared to the previousquarter, or even a full one percent," he added. The third monthly rise in exports in a row bolstered theview that economic activity has picked up in the July-Septemberperiod after Germany ended its sharpest postwar recession in thesecond quarter by posting growth of 0.3 percent. Bundesbank President Axel Weber said last week he wasconfident expansion in the third quarter would outstrip theApril-June period and some economists believe German's economycould grow by more than 3 percent next year. Forward-looking indicators such as the Ifo institute'smonthly gauge of German business sentiment -- which has risenfor the last five months -- suggest the economy shouldstrengthen further in the months ahead. Data on Monday showed that manufacturing orders rose abigger-than-expected 3.5 percent in July.  RISKS AHEAD The trade data beat a Reuters poll prediction for a surplusof 11.4 billion euros. Imports had been forecast to rise 0.4percent on the month and exports by 1.0 percent. Compared with last year, however, trade remains weak. Exports were down by 18.7 percent year-on-year in July,while imports fell by 22.3 percent, the Office said. In absolute terms, exports are still only approaching thelevel they were at the start of 2006, Bundesbank data show. Economists believe much of the impetus for German growth inthe third quarter will come from companies rebuilding theirstocks, which were liquidated during the sharpest phase of thedownturn in the winter half-year of 2008/2009. Government stimulus measures such as a cash-for-clunkersscheme to boost car sales played a key role in ending recessionbut that is now exhausted and other props for the economy suchas a subsidy for short term work may be reaching their limits. The risk of rising joblessness, further writedowns by banksand the threat of a credit crunch could all throw a spanner inthe works, said Gernot Griebling, an economist at LBBW. "We shouldn't get carried away. For now we're in a recoveryphase," said Griebling. "As long as these structural problemshaven't been solved, I don't think we should regard this as thestart of a self-sustaining recovery."
