<raw><![CDATA[ * Cbank keeps base rate unchanged for 6th month running * Cbank, IMF warn over fiscal sustainability risks * IMF says Hungary govt plans "bold but risky"  By Krisztina Than and Gergely Szakacs BUDAPEST, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank and theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday criticisedunorthodox government measures to fix the budget and boostgrowth, warning of risks to fiscal sustainability. The National Bank (NBH) kept interest rates at a record lowof 5.25 percent for the sixth month in a row as expected earlieron Monday, but warned of risks to inflation and markets from thedeficit-cutting plans. The IMF said the government's plans were "bold but risky",warning against changes Budapest envisages to the pensionsystem, saying the reforms could undermine investor confidenceand did not address the budget's structural position. The government's plans include cuts in personal income tax,special taxes on the energy, telecoms and retail sectors as wellas measures which pension industry figures have warned would addup to renationalisation of a successfully reformed system. "The government's commitment to the 3 percent budget deficittarget for 2011 was beneficial but ... caused a rift in ...making uncertain the effects of the measures on long-termsustainability," Governor Andras Simor said. The NBH has kept rates at a historic low of 5.25 percentfor most of this year after 10 months of easing aimed atreviving an economy that needed IMF and EU aid to pull throughthe global financial crisis. The bank said in its statement on Monday that it may need tohike interest rates "if upside risks to inflation materialise orthere is a sustained increase in perceptions of the risksassociated with the economy". Most analysts expect Hungarian rates to stay steady intonext year as weak domestic demand keeps a lid on inflation, butthe budget uncertainty makes it less clear how markets willtreat both the forint and government bonds. That said, the currency remains around one percent higherthan at the central bank last meeting in September, tradingaround 274 against the euro on Monday amid supportive globalsentiment.  IMF WARNING The IMF's delegation head, Christoph Rosenberg, told a newsconference on Monday after Article IV consultations with Hungarythat the IMF had not discussed any new -- precautionary or other-- financing deal. "We did not discuss this issue at all," Rosenberg said whenasked whether Hungary signalled interest in the Fund's newprecautionary credit line. The government had ruled out a new deal with the Fund afterit unexpectedly halted talks with lenders in July, but somemarket players were expecting it to backtrack on this stance. Rosenberg said crisis taxes would help the government tomeet its 3.8 percent of GDP budget deficit target this year, butmeasures announced so far were not quite sufficient to ensurethat the 2011 target would also be achieved. He also said the government's measures would help labourparticipation. But he added the measures were also risky as it wasuncertain how the economy would react to them and "(they) ...doraise questions about medium-term fiscal sustainability." The IMF said Hungary's economy was expected to grow by closeto 1 percent this year and by around 2.5 percent next year, butthe reaction of the economy to the tax measures was uncertain. The government has suspended payment transfers to mandatoryprivate pension funds from November which will leave anadditional at least 420 billion forints ($2.15 billion) in thestate budget in the next 14 months. "We cautioned the authorities against this step because wethink that it may in the short term resolve a goal -- showingbetter fiscal deficits on a headline basis -- but does notaddress the structural fiscal position," Rosenberg said.
