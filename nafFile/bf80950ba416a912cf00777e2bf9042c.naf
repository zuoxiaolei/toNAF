<raw><![CDATA[© Reuters.  Aussie holds gains after housingInvesting.com -The Australian dollar gaied in Asia on Wednesday as investors noted slightly better data on housing, though the figures still showed declines.AUD/USD traded at 0.7226, up 0.13%, while USD/JPY changed hands at 122.97, up 0.04% after a sharp repund in core machinery orders.In Australia, the Westpac consumer sentiment dipped 0.8% for December, down from 3.9% in the previous month.In Japan, core machinery orders for October year-on-year jumped 10.3%, far outpacing the gain of 1.4% seen with the month-on-month pace up 10.7%, well above the expected 1.5% drop.Also in Australia, home loans for October fell 0.5%, less than expected and housing finance slumped 6.1% for the same month.That is followed by CPI and PPI data from China, with a 0.1% month-on-month drop in consumer prices seen.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was flat at 98.42.Overnight, the dollar remained moderately lower against the other major currencies on Tuesday, but it remained supported by growing expectations for a rate hike by the Federal Reserve next week.The dollar remained broadly supported after Friday's strong U.S. employment data fuelled further expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates for the first time since 2006 at its upcoming meeting on December 15-16.Separately, market sentiment weakened after data on Tuesday showing that Chinese exports fell for the fifth consecutive month added to fears over a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.Exports fell 6.8% on a year-over-year basis in November as weak global demand continued to weigh. Imports were also down, falling 8.7%.             ]]></raw>
