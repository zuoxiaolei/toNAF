<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro extends falls versus dollar, yen on debt fears * Nikkei closes down 0.4 percent, Europe shares seen lower * Gold at new high as investors seek safe haven * Sentiment cautious ahead of G20 summit in South Korea By Daniel Magnowski SINGAPORE, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The euro extended its losseson Tuesday on renewed concerns about high sovereign debt in theeuro zone, providing further respite for the dollar andprompting some profit-taking in stocks. European shares were flat at the open, subdued by losses onWall Street and Asia as investors focused on a batch ofEuropean corporate results due later in the day. The FTSEurofirst 300  and Britain's FTSE 100 were little changed. Germany's DAX  andFrance's CAC-40  were marginally lower. Gold added to a record breaking run, hitting a new highabove $1,400 an ounce as investors sought safe havens in theface of a number of uncertainties, including the euro-area debtconcerns and this week's G20 leaders' summit. The euro , trading down 0.2 percent at $1.3866 by0735 GMT, has dropped 3 percent against the dollar from a 9-Â½  month high set last week and against the yen  hasslipped to a one-week low, although some forecast limiteddownside. "We've probably seen a short-term top in the euro," said GrantTurley, strategist at ANZ in Sydney, adding it was a mildcorrective move and unlikely to worsen unless concerns over theeuro zone's sovereign debt intensify.

The yield on Irish 10-year bonds hit 8 percent for thefirst time on Monday. [ID:nLDE6A722M] Adding to the market's cautious tone, top officials at theU.S. Federal Reserve offered differing assessments of thecentral bank's $600 billion bond-buying programme announcedlast week. One argued it was an effective way to offset deflationrisks and another warned it might need to be curbed to head-offinflationary pressures. [ID:nN08243349] Another uncertainty for markets is a G20 leaders' meetingthis week in South Korea, where currency tensions loom large asreflected in criticism of the Fed's monetary easing. "The market is also going to be wary ahead of G20 but Ithink they'll struggle to come up with any substantive plan,"ANZ's Turley said. PROFITS Investors in stock markets, cautious after recent rises,chose to bank gains. The benchmark Nikkei average  closed down 0.4percent after it had risen more than 6 percent in the past foursessions and to a three-month high on Monday.  "It's about time to take profits as the Nikkei has rapidlyclimbed above 9,700, which is the upper end of its recentrange, so the market became cautious about buying further,"said Tomomi Yamashita, a fund manager at Shinkin AssetManagement. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.4 percent. Since September, when investors began to price in that theFed's efforts to print more cash would lead to more capitalinflows into fast-growing Asia, the index has outperformed theMSCI world benchmark , with gains of 21 percentversus 18 percent. In market news, a source told Reuters that the founder ofChina's largest e-commerce company Alibaba Group had beenapproached by private equity investors to gauge his interest intaking part in a bid for Yahoo Inc . [ID:nTOE6A806O] The G20 summit has been pitched as a chance for leaders ofthe world's advanced and developing economies to stop acurrency row from spiralling into trade-damaging protectionism,but there is little sign of consensus. That is leading investors to seek out safe haveninvestments. Gold  hit a record high of $1,414.60 per ounce andpalladium  rose to a nine-year peak. [ID:nSGE6A8053] Spot silver  hit a fresh 30-year high for a fourthstraight session, exceeding $28 per ounce, though support forthe dollar weighed on broader commodity markets. U.S. crude futures  fell 21 cents to $86.85 perbarrel following six straight sessions of rises. (Editing by Neil Fullick)             ]]></raw>
