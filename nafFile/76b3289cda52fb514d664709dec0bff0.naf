<raw><![CDATA[ * Q4 GDP revised down to zero qtr/qtr from +0.1 percent * PMIs suggest 2010 recovery gaining traction * OECD sees euro zone growth in Q1, higher in Q2 * Germany tipped to drive recovery; Greece weighs (Wraps euro zone GDP, PMI, OECD forecast) By Jan Strupczewski BRUSSELS, April 7 (Reuters) - Euro zone growth stalled inthe last quarter of 2009 as investment turned out weaker thanexpected, revised data showed on Wednesday, but a benchmarksurvey suggested this year's fragile recovery is gainingtraction. The gross domestic product of the 16 countries using theeuro posted zero growth quarter-on-quarter in October-December,rather than the previously reported 0.1 percent expansion, theEuropean Union's statistics office said. In Greece, where an escalating debt crisis has in recentdays pounded the single currency and fuelled speculation over apossible European bailout, the recession deepened to a quarterlycontraction of 0.8 percent. The euro zone economy contracted 2.2 percent year-on-year,more than the previously estimated 2.1 percent, Eurostat said. "The changes make little difference to the 'big picture',"said Ken Wattret, economist at BNP Paribas. "Leading indicators point to a pick-up in growth momentum inthe first half of 2010, particularly in Germany, which isreflected in our forecast profile. We assume an average quarter-on-quarter growth rate of 0.3 percent in the euro zone and of0.5 percent in Germany." ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For a graphic on euro zone gross domestic product, click on:http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/10/04/EZ_GDPC0410.gif^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The euro zone's dominant service sector grew at its fastestpace in over two years in March, with all four big economiesexpanding as firms became more optimistic about the year ahead,a survey showed on Wednesday. Markit said its final Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers'Index of around 2,000 companies, ranging from banks to hotels,jumped to 54.1 in March from 51.8 in February, revised up from aflash estimate of 53.7 released two weeks ago.  That is its highest reading since November 2007 and marksthe seventh month the index has been above the 50.0 mark thatdivides growth from contraction.  UNEVEN RECOVERY "Latest euro zone data and survey evidence point to a clearreturn to growth in the first quarter of 2010 despite thesignificant weather-related hit to activity early in the year,"said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. "Nevertheless, activity is still pretty uneven -- withpersistently muted consumer spending a particular concern -- andrelapses remain a very real danger," he said. Underlining the growth discrepancies within the euro zone,Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said on Wednesday thecountry's banks, hit by a series of credit rating downgrades,had asked the government for billions of euros of extra support. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) forecast on Wednesday that annualised, quarter-on-quartereuro zone growth would be 0.9 percent in the first three monthsof 2010 and 1.9 percent in the second quarter. The OECD's chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan told Reutersthe euro zone's biggest economy Germany, where GDP stagnated inthe fourth quarter, could help boost the region's growth. "Germany could boost its investment rate by expandingliberalisation to services, therefore raising growth potential,"Padoan said. "It would add to Germany's competitiveness and atthe same time deal with European growth and imbalances in theeuro area," he said.  PORTUGUESE CONTRACTION The key change to the previous estimates for euro zone GDPin the fourth quarter was a deeper quarterly fall in privateinvestment, which shrank 0.3 percent, rather than the previouslyreported 0.2 percent. The fourth-quarter outcome also turned out weaker becausethe contraction in Italy was deeper than previously thought. Theeconomy there shrank 0.3 percent rather than 0.2 percentquarter-on-quarter. Growth in the Netherlands was 0.2 percent, instead of thepreviously reported 0.3 percent on the quarter. Portugal, where growth was previously reported to have beenzero on a quarterly basis, had a contraction of 0.2 percent. Only exports and inventory growth prevented the euro zonefrom slipping back into negative growth as the contribution fromgovernment and household consumption was zero. "Inventories added 0.1 percentage point to GDP, therebydashing hopes that the slowdown in GDP growth had been at leastpartly the result of a further running down of stocks whichwould at least help growth going forward," said Archer. The positive contribution from net trade was 0.2 percentagepoint. Separately, Eurostat said prices at factory gates in theeuro zone rose 0.1 percent month-on-month in February, asexpected by economists polled by Reuters, for a 0.5 percentyear-on-year fall. Economists had expected a 0.4 percent annual fall.(Additional reporting by Jonathan Cable in London, Brian Lovein Paris, editing by Dale Hudson, John Stonestreet)             ]]></raw>
