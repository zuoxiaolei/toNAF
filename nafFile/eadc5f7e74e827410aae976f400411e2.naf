<raw><![CDATA[  * Dollar index hovers near seven-week high * Market eyes developments in Irish debt crisis * US consumer prices softer-than-expected (Updates prices, adds comment) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher againstthe dollar on Wednesday as tepid U.S. inflation data and weakhousing starts supported the Federal Reserve's quantitativeeasing and provided a signal for investors to resume sellingthe greenback. Talk that Ireland may soon receive help to fix its bankingand sovereign debt problems also lifted the euro, although thecurrency's upside could be limited because of concerns thatproblems could spread to other euro zone economies. The euro earlier slid to a low of $1.3460 on tradingplatform EBS, not far from a seven-week trough hit on Tuesdayat $1.3446. Key support lies at $1.3436, the 50 percentretracement of the August to November rally, and a break couldopen the way for a drop toward the low $1.30s, traders said. "With today's CPI data kind of confirming that the Fed isdoing the right thing on QE, the Federal Reserve is unlikely toback off," said Greg Anderson, senior currency strategist atCitiFX in New York. U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in October andthe increase in the year-on-year core rate was the smallest onrecord. Housing starts were likewise weak last month, fallingto their lowest level since April 2009. For a wrapup of U.S.data, click on [ID:nN17190977]. "As a result, we've seen yields stabilizing and it lookslike they're headed lower, which is good for risk sentiment,"Anderson said. In late afternoon trading, the euro  was up 0.2percent at $1.3519. The single currency has lost about 3percent this month as investors have cut long positions onperipheral debt worries. The market's focus was mainly on Ireland, whose highborrowing costs and large deficit have kindled fears of aGreek-style crisis in which budget problems in one countryweigh on the entire euro zone. Nervousness grew after European clearing house LCH.Clearnet doubled its margin requirement on Irish governmentbonds to 30 percent of net positions, citing higher Irishyields over German benchmarks. HOPES FOR IRELAND RESOLUTION However, speculation that a resolution of Ireland'sproblems is close helped the euro. Irish Prime Minister BrianCowen on Wednesday said the country is currently not in a"threatening situation" and there are "sensible, precautionarydiscussions taking place. [ID:nWLA8368]. "Any report of any pending solution to the Irish ...problem will cause a rebound in the euro," said JosephTrevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in SaddleRiver, New Jersey. "It will not eliminate the concern but it will sponsor areaction against the speculation that has been driving the eurodown. The Europeans are not going to let this situation blowup. It would be too damaging for the euro." Ireland agreed on Wednesday to work with a EuropeanUnion-IMF mission on urgent steps to shore up its shatteredbanking sector, a process that could lead to a bailout despiteDublin's deep reluctance. Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihansaid talks would start on Thursday.

Citi's Anderson said he believes the euro may have alreadyformed a bottom given Tuesday's huge liquidation of longpositions. He said the euro could climb to $1.3850 in a fewweeks, although he is not expecting new highs. Markets also await the release of the Irish governmentbudget due a week from Friday for a clearer picture ofIreland's sovereign debt.
