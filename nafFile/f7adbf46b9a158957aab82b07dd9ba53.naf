<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar rallies broadly; euro falls to 10-month low * Fitch Ratings cuts Portugal's sovereign rating * Dollar index hits highest since May 2009 * Swiss franc climbs to fresh record high vs euro (Adds comments, details. Updates prices) By Vivianne Rodrigues NEW YORK, March 24 (Reuters) - The dollar rallied broadly,while the euro fell to 10-month lows on Wednesday, as a ratingsfirm downgraded Portugal, adding to worries over debtsustainability and growth in some of euro zone's smallercountries.   Fitch Ratings lowered Portugal's sovereign credit rating toAA- from AA, with a negative outlook. An already weak euro fell to the day's low of $1.3335 afterthe announcement to its lowest since early May 2009. Traders said a raft of stop-losses had been hit near the$1.3440/30 area in Asia, contributing to the declines. In the U.S., the dollar extended gains after a reportshowed new orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rosefor the third straight month in February. Analysts said portions of the durable goods report werepositive and helped add further support the U.S. dollar. "If you look at the ex-transportation and ex-aircraft, thiswas a good report," said Michael Woolfolk, a senior currencystrategist at BNY Mellon, in New York. "We're seeing a strong speculative move in favor of thedollar right now," he said. "I think we could get to $1.30 ineuro-dollar by the end of the week." In morning trading in New York, the dollar was 1.7 percenthigher at 91.90 yen, after touching a session high of 91.96 yenprior to the data. The euro was last down 1.2 percent at $1.3340. The singlecurrency got little help from a rise in the German Ifoinstitute's business climate index, which climbed to 98.1 from95.2 in February, higher than forecasts for 95.8. "The euro is independently weak, with a significantlybetter-than-expected reading on the German Ifo proving only atemporary distraction from the problems in the periphery," saidAdam Cole, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.  The market will keep a close eye on an EU summit onThursday and Friday, after Germany signaled for the first timethat it may accept European financial aid for Greece as a lastresort. But Germany pegged its support to several conditions,including the need for the International Monetary Fund to makea "substantial contribution". DOLLAR GAINS Investors flocked to the perceived safety of the U.S.currency, pushing the dollar to its highest since May last yearagainst a basket of currencies. The dollar index, which tracks the performance of thegreenback versus six other major currencies, was up 1 percentat 81.749. And the greenback hit a two-week peak against theSwiss franc at 1.0716, according to Reuters data. Higher risk currencies such as the Australian and NewZealand dollars also fell 0.9 percent against the U.S. dollar. Traders also cited a shortage of dollar supply in the moneymarkets as the end of the financial quarter approached,together with a potential liquidity squeeze over the Easterbreak.
