<raw><![CDATA[ By Bappa Majumdar NEW DELHI, April 28 (Reuters) - India's government isplanning to introduce a delayed nuclear liability bill inparliament, officials said on Wednesday, a move that will allowentry of U.S. firms into the country's $150 billion sector. A 2008 civilian nuclear deal with the United States endedIndia's nuclear isolation since its 1974 atomic test, and gaveit access to U.S. technology and fuel. But endorsement of the Civil Liability for Nuclear DamageBill is imperative for private U.S. firms reluctant to dobusiness in India without legislation that underwrites theircompensation liability in the case of industrial accidents. In March the government was forced to shelve plans tointroduce the bill in parliament following protests by theopposition, who say the bill favours private players. But after Tuesday's victory in a confidence vote moved bythe main opposition parties in parliament, the Congressappeared to be moving forward on key pending bills, includingon pension reform and entry of foreign universities. "The (nuclear liability) bill will be enacted into a lawafter completing all required procedures," India's Science andTechnology Minister Prithviraj Chavan, said in parliament. "The act will enter into force after notification by thegovernment," he said. Chavan did not say when the bill would be introduced. Thecurrent session of parliament ends May 7. Congress party officials told Reuters that after PrimeMinister Manmohan Singh returned from a regional summit inBhutan this week, a decision would be made on when to introducethe bill. French and Russian nuclear firms plan to set up in India,and New Delhi has offered to tender construction of two plants,a business opportunity worth $10 billion, to U.S.-based firmsGE-Hitachi and Westinghouse Electric, a subsidiary of Japan'sToshiba Corp. The main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party opposes the billon grounds that it seeks to put a maximum liability of about$450 million on the state-run reactor operator without placingany compensation burden on private suppliers and contractors. Although the legislation has been cleared by the cabinet,the government needs the support of the BJP to ratify the billin the upper house, where it along with its allies has a strongpresence. The government has said it is willing to address oppositionconcerns and send the bill to a standing committee. "The opposition have articulated their concern, butobviously legislation has to be moved, and the bill has to beintroduced in parliament," Manish Tewari, a Congress leadertold Reuters.
