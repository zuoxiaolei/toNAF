<raw><![CDATA[ * Uncertainty over Greece hitting jittery euro * Greek/German bond spreads close to record highs * Australian dollar buoyed by rate expectations/commodities (Updates prices; adds quote, dateline; previous TOKYO) By Neal Armstrong LONDON, April 7 (Reuters) - The euro held near a one-weeklow against the dollar on Wednesday on uncertainty over aproposed Greek aid deal, while the Australian dollar ralliedagainst the yen on expectations of higher interest rates. The euro has been pressured in recent sessions following amedia report Greece wanted to renegotiate a jointEU-International Monetary Fund aid deal reached last month. Greece denied the report but on Tuesday the yield spreadbetween Greek and German government bonds exceeded 4 percentagepoints, the widest since the euro's launch. "Renewed uncertainty over Greece is hurting an alreadyjittery euro," said Stuart Bennett, senior FX strategist atCredit Agricole. "Even though the market is already heavily short of euro,there is still downside risk." At 0802 GMT, the euro was trading down around 0.1 percentversus the dollar at $1.3385 after dropping to a one-week low of$1.3353 on Tuesday. "With Greek spreads to Bunds having blown out, the euro isgoing to be struggling to sustain gains," said Sue Trinh, seniorcurrency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong. The single currency came off the day's lows after the eurozone's services purchasing manager index was revised higher to54.1, its highest since November 2007, from an original estimateof 53.7 and February's 51.8.  Traders said sentiment towards the single currency wasbearish with many macro funds selling the euro on rallies,targeting a move towards the year's low at $1.3265. Worries over Greece's debts and those of other peripheraleuro zone countries have knocked the single currency down almost10 percent from its January high of $1.4582. The euro was flat at 125.72 yen after losing over 1.2percent on Tuesday. AUSSIE BUOYED The Australian dollar remained close to an 11-week high of$0.9288 set on Tuesday after the Reserve Bank of Australia onTuesday raised its cash rate to 4.25 percent and flagged morehikes in the coming months. Traders said a favourable outlook for commodity pricescoupled with perceived dovish Federal Reserve minutes on Tuesdayhad boosted risk appetite, which was helping to underpin theAustralian dollar. The Fed said subdued inflation trends were likely to warrantan exceptionally low federal funds rate for an extended period..  The Aussie topped 87.50 yen after breaching its 200-weekmoving average at 87.06 yen, but pulled back later after nearingresistance at 87.70, the 61.8 percent retracement of its fall in2007 from above 107.80 to 55.11 in late 2008. The yen stayed soft versus the dollar at 93.85 yen afterhitting 94.26 in Asia, with rising short-term dollar rates andTreasury yields supporting the dollar. The Bank of Japan said after keeping its monetary policyunchanged that the economy was picking up further, but analystssay prolonged deflation is likely to keep the governmentpressing the bank for more monetary easing.
