<raw><![CDATA[ * EMA recommends Brilinta, to be sold as Brilique in Europe * Brilinta is AstraZeneca's biggest new drug hope * Consensus forecasts point to sales of $2 bln by 2014 * EU green light was expected, shares up 0.6 percent * U.S. regulators to decide on drug by Dec. 16  (Updates share price, adds background) By Ben Hirschler LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca's new heart medicineBrilinta won a green light from regulators on Europe on Friday,boosting prospects for its biggest drug hope which analystsexpect to become a multi-billion-dollar a year seller. The European Medicines Agency said it had recommendedapproval for the drug, to be sold as Brilique in Europe, forpreventing dangerous blood clots in patients with serious chestpain or previous heart attacks. Recommendations from the regulator are normally endorsed bythe European Commission within a few months. AstraZeneca is relying on revenues from Brilinta to offsetexpiring patents on some of its best-selling medicines, such asheartburn treatment Nexium and Seroquel for schizophrenia. Industry analysts expect Brilinta's sales to reach $1.95billion by 2014, according to consensus estimates compiled byThomson Reuters. The drug is a competitor for Sanofi-Aventis andBristol-Myers Squibb's top-seller Plavix, the world'ssecond-biggest drug with sales last year of more than $9.5billion, which is off patent in parts of Europe and will loseU.S. patent protection in 2012. Brilinta proved superior to Plavix in a key clinical trialpresented last year. AstraZeneca's product is also a rival for Eli Lilly andDaiichi Sankyo recently introduced Effient, which has so far hadslow sales, due to concerns about bleeding risks. Plavix, Brilinta and Effient all work by stopping bloodplatelets from sticking together and forming clots that cancause heart attacks and strokes. Brilinta's approval in Europe had been widely expected byboth investors and doctors. In a notable vote of confidence theEuropean Society of Cardiology last month added Brilinta as atreatment option under new European medical guidelines, eventhough it has yet to be approved for sale. AstraZeneca shares were 0.6 percent higher by 1400 GMT,outperforming a flat European drugs sector. In the United States, the product was endorsed by anadvisory panel in July, despite a perplexing lack of benefitseen in a North American sub-group of patients in the mainclinical trial that showed strong overall advantages. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Sept. 15 itneeded more time to study the application and would now completeits review of Brilinta by Dec. 16 rather than by Sept. 16 asoriginally indicated.
