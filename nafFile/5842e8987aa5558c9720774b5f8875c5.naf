<raw><![CDATA[ * Nikkei down 0.5 pct, Asia ex-Japan stocks edge up * Australia dollar leaps to new record high after CPI * US dollar hits 4-mth low vs yen * Clock ticks on Washington's Aug 2 deadline on debt (Updates prices)	 By Kevin Plumberg	 SINGAPORE, July 27 (Reuters) - Gold prices hit a record highof more than $1,625 an ounce on Wednesday and Asian stockmarkets were largely flat as news out of Washington indicatedpoliticians were making little progress in ending a deadlockover raising the U.S. debt ceiling.	 Republicans had to delay bringing a plan to a vote in theU.S. House of Representatives because it was being rewritten,while an analyst at Standard & Poor's told CNBC thatprioritising debt payments to avoid a default would be "deeplydisruptive" to the economy.  	 Debt and inflation were globally the main focuses ofinvestors.   	 The Australian dollar jumped to a post-float high above$1.1060 after second quarter inflation figures were higher thanforecast, squeezing investors who had recently increased betsthat the Australian central bank would cut rates this year.	 The Australian dollar and other Asia-Pacific currencies havebeen rising as traders anticipate more policymaker action tokeep quickening inflation and capital inflows at bay.	 The threat of a U.S. default and a credit rating downgradeloomed over equity markets and the dollar, which was sold acrossthe board on Tuesday, though a one-notch cut may not have alasting impact on markets.	 "The impact of a credit downgrade on the financial marketswould be negative for growth. The induced shocks to the economycould lower next quarter's real GDP growth to close to zero.However, a likely rebound in Q4 growth, following a resolutionof the budget debacle, could leave growth in the second halflower by 0.6 percent," said Michael Carey, North American chiefeconomist with Credit Agricole, in a note.	  DEBT POLITICS 	 The crisis over Washington's borrowing limit has nottriggered a persistent selloff in risky assets, especially sincemany investors see few alternatives to the depth of the U.S.Treasury market and contrast the political nature of the U.S.crisis with the structural problems in the euro zone. 	 Most market watchers expect some sort of last-minute deal inWashington. But the standoff has made investors increasinglyhedge against an adverse outcome, particularly with the clockticking toward an Aug. 2 deadline when the U.S. Treasury said itwould not be able to borrow anymore.	 Japan's Nikkei share average fell 0.5 percent , ledby Honda Motor Co shares, which ended the day down 1.7 percent . 	 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was up0.4 percent , though trading volume was lowthroughout the region, suggesting many investors were choosingto sit on the sidelines until the outlook becomes clearer.	 The U.S. dollar index , which gauges its value againsta basket of six other major currencies, was largely unchanged onthe day after earlier hitting a fresh 2-1/2-month low at 73.42. 	 The dollar hit a four-month low against the yen, just below77.70 , though the march lower has been sluggish becauseof fears that Japan may step into markets unilaterally to slowits currency's gains.	 Japanese policymakers are becoming alarmed at persistent yenrises and considering solo currency intervention as anincreasingly viable option for the near term, sources withknowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. 	 The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was at2.97 percent , up around 2 basis points from lateTuesday in New York. The yield has darted around 3 percent forthe past week, with traders highly uncertain about the near termoutlook.  	 Shorter-term securities reflect more of the unease amonginvestors, with T-bills maturing in August yielding 2 to 3 basispoints more than debt coming due in September. 	 In commodity markets, gold climbed to an all-time high of$1,625.24 an ounce , having risen more than 14 percent sofar this year, greatly exceeding the S&P 500 index's 6 percentgain so far. 	 "The same arguments about potential government bond falloutare still being made," said a Singapore-based trader, "butpeople are on the sidelines ahead of the August deadline waitingto see whether or not the U.S. is going to avoid a technicaldefault."  	 U.S. crude oil futures  fell 19 cents to $99.40 abarrel, while Brent crude futures  were up 10 cents at$118.40.
