<raw><![CDATA[ Dec 8 (Reuters) - Hungary's government plans to change thecentral bank law to let a parliamentary committee fill allvacant posts on the central bank's Monetary Council next yearwhen the mandates of four rate setters expire. The move would leave central bank (NBH) Governor AndrasSimor and his two deputies in a minority on the seven-memberpanel and could pave the way for monetary policy changesfavoured by the government. The changes in the bank will come in a crucial period whenmarkets will be nervous anyway as the government must detail asavings plan of up to 800 billion forints ($3.78 billion) topersuade investors that its economic policy is sustainable. To see main story please double click on  Q: How does the government plan to change the law? A: According to a planned amendment, parliament's economiccommittee -- where government lawmakers have a majority -- wouldbe allowed to appoint new Monetary Council members. That would strip Simor -- often criticised by the government-- of his right to nominate two members. The six-year mandatesof Tamas Banfi, Peter Bihari, Csaba Csaki and Judit Nemenyiexpire on March 1 next year. The terms of Simor and hisdeputies, Julia Kiraly and Ferenc Karvalits, end in 2013. The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to publish itsview on the planned changes in the next two weeks. Analysts saidthe change could hurt the NBH's independence, and the ECB andthe European Union could criticise the  government. Sanctionsare unlikely as the move does not affect existing mandates. Earlier the EU called on Hungary to change a law which cutpublic sector pay -- including at the central bank -- which itsaid infringed the bank's independence. The government has keptthe measures in place. Q: Will the central bank lift its inflation target? A: According to a report by news portal index.hu, thegovernment wants to have the central bank raise its inflationtarget to 3.5 percent from 3.0 percent. The NBH projects 3.3 percent average inflation for 2012, andthe government sees 3.3-3.5 percent for the years to 2015 --levels which would also mean that the country is unlikely tojoin the euro zone before the second half of this decade. Setting the inflation target has been the central bank'sexclusive jurisdiction since 2007. A review of the target is duenext year. Analysts said the new Monetary Council was likely tolift the target, as that would allow it to loosen.  Q: What else can change in monetary policy? A: Three months ago, the NBH batted back governmentsuggestions that the bank should use monetary stimulus to helpthe economy recover. Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy said the NBH should buycorporate bonds, primarily those of the state development bankMFB, in the secondary market to help provide liquidity to theeconomy and foster economic growth. The bank has said that monetary stimulus measures couldfurther lift inflation and that the government had moreefficient fiscal policy tools to stimulate economic growth. The new Monetary Council could adopt the idea of monetarystimulus.  Q: What can the changes mean to markets? A: The conflict between the government and the NBH hasalready contributed to pressure on the forint and Hungariangovernment bonds and could further increase market volatility ifthe euro zone debt crisis keeps investors wary of economieswhere they see fiscal vulnerabilities. Hungary's risk assessment hinges on developments in the eurozone and the details of the promised savings package, while badnews about the NBH can magnify volatility, analysts said. Hungarian governments have tended to intervene in centralbank affairs in the hope they can achieve looser monetarypolicy. But past developments, including an enlargement of theCouncil in 2005, showed new appointees acted independently whenthe panel decided on interest rates, analysts say. If the inflation target is raised, that may in itself dentthe NBH's credibility and lead to a weakening of the forint anda rise in long-end government bond yields. Monetary stimulus is also a risk to markets as it mayincrease inflation pressure, while the impacts are unpredictableas the government has not detailed its idea.
