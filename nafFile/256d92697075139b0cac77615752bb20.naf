<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The yen weakened on Wednesday as the Bank of Japan starts a two-day policy board meeting and releases trade data for October.USD/JPY traded at 100.18, up 0.04%, in a range of 100.14 - 100.22 ahead of October trade data at 0850 local time (2350 GMT) expected to show a deficit of JPY814 billion.AUD/USD traded at 0.9428, down 0.06%, in a range of 0.9426 - 0.9434 ahead of Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index for September at 1030 local time (2330 GMT) which came in at 3.2% the previous month. Also on the calendar are remarks by Reserve Bank of Australia Assistant Governor Guy Debelle at 1130 local time (0030 GMT).Overnight, the dollar traded lower against most major currencies ahead of the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's October policy meeting, which investors doubted would contain hints as to when the U.S. central bank will announce plans to scale back stimulus programs.Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke is also due to speak in public later Tuesday, and markets took up positions betting that the nation's top economist won't signal the need for a timetable to begin tapering the Fed's USD85 billion in monthly bond purchases, which keep the greenback weak to spur recovery.Last week, Fed Chair Nominee Janet Yellen suggested the economy still needs the U.S. central bank's ultra-loose monetary policies to ensure recovery, and on Monday, the Fed's Bank of New York chief William C. Dudley said he was hopeful that recovery will gain steam soon but made no indication over a need to consider scaling back bond purchases.Investors also bet that the minutes of the Fed’s October meeting due for release on Wednesday will paint a similar picture for the need to hold off on scaling back stimulus tools for now.Meanwhile across the Atlantic, European Central Bank board member Joerg Asmussen warned that monetary authorities must be “very careful” when considering the use of negative interest rates to steer the economy away from low inflation rates, which supported the single currency.EUR/USD traded at 1.3535, down 0.03%, in early Asian markets.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was at 80.70, down 0.02%, in Asian trade.On Wednesday, the U.S. is to release data on retail sales, consumer inflation, existing home sales and business inventories.             ]]></raw>
