<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The euro edged higher against the U.S. dollar on Monday, easing up to a one-month high, boosted by expectations that the European Central Bank will signal a July rate hike later this week.EUR/USD hit 1.4658 during late Asian trade, the pair’s highest since May 5; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4644, gaining 0.06%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.4450, Friday’s low and resistance at 1.4898, the high of May 5.The euro found support after the European Union and the International Monetary Fund agreed Friday to pay the next installment to Greece under last year’s bailout, averting the risk of a default. The dollar remained under pressure after data on Friday showed that nonfarm payrolls rose much less-than-expected in May, increasing by just 54K, pushing the unemployment rate up to 9.1% from 9.0%.The ECB is to hold its rate-setting meeting on Thursday, where it is widely expected to signal a July interest-rate hike. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is expected to keep rates on hold for the rest of the year, a view reinforced by Friday's jobs data.The euro was also slightly higher against the pound, with EUR/GBP inching up 0.02% to hit 0.8910.Elsewhere, on Sunday, Portugal’s centre-right Social Democrats defeated the Socialists in an election, giving the party a strong mandate to enact an austerity program to meet the conditions of the country’s bailout.             ]]></raw>
