The dollar was hovering close to two-and-a-half year highs against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.49% to 88.30.Investors continued to shun the yen amid expectations that Japan’s government, led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, will pressure the Bank of Japan to implement more aggressive easing measures at its policy meeting later this month as part of an effort to combat deflation.The greenback was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD up 0.16% to 1.6047.The Bank of England kept its benchmark interest rate on hold at 0.5% and maintained the size of its asset purchase program at GBP375 billion Thursday, in a widely anticipated decision.The greenback slid to session lows against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF down 0.27% to 0.9227.
