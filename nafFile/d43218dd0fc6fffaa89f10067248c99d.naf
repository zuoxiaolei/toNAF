<raw><![CDATA[ * Q3 GDP growth hits fastest quarterly pace since Q1 2002 * Inventory build major contributor to growth * Government spending falls, fuels worry stimulus fading * Finance minister surprised but says too early to exit * Doubts remain central bank can raise rates this year (Adds finance minister in paragraph 3, updates markets) By Seo Eun-kyung and Yoo Choonsik SEOUL, Oct 26 (Reuters) - South Korea's economy grew at itsfastest pace in more than seven years in the third quarter,relying on an inventory build rather than other growth driversand so pressuring the central bank to cap interest rates thisyear. Gross domestic product rose a seasonally adjusted 2.9percent in July to September, stronger than a 2.2 percent riseforecast in a Reuters poll and the fastest clip since the firstquarter of 2002. The Bank of Korea, which released the data on Monday, saidAsia's fourth-largest economy would not have grown at allwithout the buildup in inventory and Finance Minister YoonJeung-hyun reiterated that it was too early for authorities towithdraw stimulus put in place to support activity during thefinancial crisis. "I see companies' restocking contributed substantially tothe GDP growth, while consumption and construction investmentremain weak," said Seo Cheol-soo, an economist at DaewooSecurities. "I do not think this data, while strong, will prompt theBank of Korea to raise the key interest rate suddenly. (Therate rise will come) perhaps in the first quarter of nextyear." GDP rose a revised 2.6 percent in the second quarter. The export-dependent economy expanded by 0.6 percent in thethird quarter from a year earlier, contrary to expectations fora decline of 0.3 percent and marking the first year-on-yeargrowth since the third quarter of 2008. December treasury bond futures more than halved their early30-tick loss by 0055 GMT. The 1- and 3-year interest rate swapspread slightly widened, reflecting an unchanged near-termoutlook for the policy interest rate. RATE RISE SEEN BY EARLY 2010 The Bank of Korea said in a statement that privateconsumption and capital investment were the next biggestcontributors to the quarterly growth after the inventorybuildup, whereas government spending and net exports dragged ongrowth. Government spending shrank by a seasonally adjusted 0.8percent in the third quarter after a 1.1 percent gain in theprevious quarter, underlining concerns that the effect ofglobal stimulus was quickly fading. Most analysts expect the Bank of Korea to keep interestrates on hold until early next year to wait for evidence thatthe global economic recovery is on a solid footing followingits worst downturn in decades. But some economists, including Song Jae-hyeok at SKSecurities, argue the economy is strong enough to persuade thecentral bank to start a campaign of normalising interest ratesfrom their record-low level of 2.0 percent. The Bank of Korea next reviews the 7-day repurchaseagreement rate on Nov. 12. "The impressive third-quarter GDP growth rate will likelypersuade the Bank of Korea to raise rates in November, giventhat is has always tightened rates whenever the economy hasexpanded as fast as now," Song said. Bank of Korea Governor Lee Seong-tae said in August andSeptember the central bank was ready to raise interest ratessoon unless property prices and a credit boom subsided. But hesignificantly softened his tone in October. (Additional reporting by Lee Shin-hyung and Cheon Jong-woo;Editing by Jonathan Hopfner & Neil Fullick)             ]]></raw>
