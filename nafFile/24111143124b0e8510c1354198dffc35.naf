<raw><![CDATA[   * Dollar up, pulls away from 14-month low vs euro * Weaker stocks cool risk demand, supporting U.S. currency * Euro remains near $1.50, renewed rally expected * China stimulus fears briefly rattle market * Report suggests Canada can cope with stronger currency (Updates prices, adds details) By Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Thursdayand the euro retreated from a 14-month high above $1.50 asinvestors took profits on the greenback's recent sharp slideagainst major currencies. The dollar hit a one-month peak at 91.70 yen  whilecommodity-linked currencies such as the Australian dollarretreated from a near 15-month high and stocks and oil fell. Since April, the dollar has lost nearly 12 percent againstsix major currencies , with heavy selling in recent weekspushing it to multi-month lows. Investors began to question how much further the dollarcould slide, and how much other assets could rally, sendingfunds out of riskier currencies that have gained on signs ofeconomic recovery. "We've seen a big move across a host of assets lately and alot of people are looking for when we're going to top out, sothere's some profit-taking today," said Camilla Sutton, seniorcurrency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. Worse-than-expected U.S. jobless claims data on Thursdayoffset generally positive U.S. earnings and rekindled doubtsabout the strength of the United States' economic rebound. With U.S. unemployment near 10 percent, investors expectinterest rates to remain at record lows well into 2010 even ifsigns of stronger world growth prompt other central banks toraise rates and begin winding down some emergency spending. Low rates make the dollar less attractive than higher-yieldcurrencies more closely correlated with economic recovery. Atthe same time, economic jitters boost the dollar's safetyappeal.   The euro fell 0.1 percent at $1.4991  after hittinga 14-month peak of $1.5046 Wednesday. The dollar was last up0.5 percent to 91.44 yen  and sterling fell 0.2 percentto $1.6566  off Wednesday's one-month high above $1.66. Sterling's dip stalled a nine-day rally, and data showingUK retail sales were flat in September helped slow the pound'supward momentum. [ID:nLM512181] Against the Canadian dollar, the greenback rose 0.6 percentto C$1.0490 . Earlier it rose above C$1.05 but fell afterthe Bank of Canada's quarterly monetary policy report suggestedofficials think the economy can cope with a stronger currency.[ID:nBAC002339]. The Bank of Canada left interest rates at record lowsearlier this week and dashed expectations of a hike before themiddle of 2010. The Australian dollar  fell 0.6 percent to $0.9219. Sutton, though, said the dollar is still vulnerable, whileMichael Klawitter, senior strategist at Commerzbank inFrankfurt, added "the euro's proximity to $1.50 suggests thatthe market is not taking the correction too seriously." Another trigger for the dollar's gains, analysts said, werefears that China may start considering withdrawing some of itsemergency stimulus programs after data showed the economy grewby a robust 8.9 percent in the third quarter. But the government said it would retain its ultra-loosemonetary and fiscal policies, and Chinese-based analysts addedgrowth was not strong enough to trigger policy tightening.[ID:nSP452724] "There are fears that when there is a removal of stimulusthe underlying fundamentals won't be enough to drive globalgrowth," Scotia's Sutton said. "But the truth is there is a lotof growth coming out of China and that whole region." Economists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. economy tohave expanded 3.2 percent in the third quarter, ending arecession that began in December 2007. But data on Thursday showed Americans filing for first-timejobless benefits rose in the latest week, underscoring thefragility of the labor market.
