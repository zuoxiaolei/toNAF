<raw><![CDATA[ * Emerging equities down 0.5 percent; Dubai, Greece weigh * Dubai CDS surge, Nakheel bond falls to record low * Central European FX steadies; rouble bucks weak trend  By Sujata Rao LONDON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Emerging stocks eased half apercent on Wednesday, weighed down by bearish newsflow fromDubai and Greece and compounded by growing doubts over theglobal economic recovery. Fears that Dubai's debt crisis may not be as contained asearlier anticipated, reverberated as far as China, where HongKong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.5 percent, partly due to worriesabout locally listed HSBC's exposure to Dubai World's $26billion debt restructuring. A ratings downgrade for Greece on Tuesday and data showing afall in German industrial production soured sentiment towardsthe euro zone this week, denting appetite for emerging marketsand raising fears that more European ratings may also be cut. And euphoria generated by positive U.S. jobs data last weekhas evaporated following cautious comments on the economy byU.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. The MSCI emerging equities index touched nine-day lowsbefore paring losses. "Markets are reacting to the explosion in Greek yields andthe continuing negative news from Dubai as well as the Moody'sreport saying U.S. and UK public finances (rating) could testthe 'AAA' boundary," said Robert Ruttman, emerging equitiesstrategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich. He said that comments by Bernanke and U.S. President BarackObama hinting at more stimulus measures aimed at job creationare being seen as an indication the economy's continued weaknessrather than a potential unleashing of more cheap cash. "Going forward any negative news will weigh heavily asequity valuations have corrected from sharply oversold levels sothe question now is: is the global recovery sustainable?"Ruttman added. The spotlight within emerging markets is on Dubai's debt saga, with bondholders mobilising against the proposed $26billion restructuring and rating agencies downgrading a raft ofthe emirate's corporates. The cost of insuring Dubai debt surged higher, withfive-year credit default swaps (CDS) up almost 50 basis pointson the day, just off a nine-month peak of almost 650 bps hit onNov. 27. The Nakheel Dec 14 $3.5 billion sukuk fell to recordlows. Currency forwards also reflected investors' fears for theregion, with UAE dirham one-year forwards quoted at 80 points,back at levels quoted just at the end of November. The forwardwas quoted at one point before the Nov 25 announcement.  ROUBLE BUCKS TREND  Most other currencies were weak but the rouble bucked thetrend to rise off the three-month lows hit earlier against itseuro-dollar basket. One trader said the rouble was merely recovering fromearlier oversold levels -- it lost 2 percent on Tuesday and isoff 6 percent from mid-November peaks but an oil price rallyafter some days of falls is spurring bargain hunters. Central European currencies steadied from the falls seenearlier this week but stayed under pressure, disappointed by thepoor German industrial data and the Greek situation. Some support came from local data. The Czech economycontracted 4.1 percent in the third quarter on the year in linewith estimates, while Hungarian gross domestic product fell lessthan expected by 7.1 percent on the year in the third quarter. The forint fell to 9-day lows earlier in the session, thenrecovered marginally to trade 0.15 percent up versus the euro.However five-year CDS widened to trade about 16 bps 232 bps, onpar with Greece. "The Greek downgrade has put the currencies under pressure,the Hungarian forint especially could be shaky," said GyulaToth, strategist at Unicredit in Vienna.  Rates markets have also been feeling the heat from the risein Greek yields after the downgrade.  Euro zone member Greece's credit default swaps are quotednow at 226 bps, while Greek five-year bonds are yielding 4.8percent versus 3.2 percent for the Czech Republic and 5.8percent for Poland -- a possible risk for central Europeanfunding costs in 2010. Polish five-year yields for instance are around 3-monthhighs, having risen about 20 bps since the start of the month. "People are looking at Greece where you are getting a betteryield pick up but we are relaxed.. in fiscal terms (the centralEuropeans) are better placed," Toth said. On sovereign bond markets, spreads on the EMBI Plus indexfell four bps to 311 bps over weaker U.S. Treasuries.  (additional reporting by Carolyn Cohn; Editing by TobyChopra)             ]]></raw>
