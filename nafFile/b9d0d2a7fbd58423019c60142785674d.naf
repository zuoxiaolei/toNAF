<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The U.S. dollar remained broadly lower against its major counterparts on Wednesday, as investors digested the impact of a flurry of mixed U.S. data on expectations for further economic stimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve.During U.S. morning trade, the greenback edged higher against the euro, with EUR/USD slipping 0.10% to hit 1.4427.In the euro zone, Germany’s cabinet approved a draft for legislation to grant new powers to the region’s bailout fund earlier Wednesday, but Chancellor Angela Merkel continued to face parliamentary opposition to the proposed changes.The greenback was also slightly higher against the pound, with GBP/USD sliding 0.07% to hit 1.6287.Elsewhere, the greenback was down against the yen and the Swiss franc, with USD/JPY shedding 0.33% to hit 76.48 and USD/CHF tumbling 1.84% to hit 0.8046.The Swissie’s sharp gains came after a CHF870 million aid package announced by Switzerland's government disappointed market expectations. Meanwhile, the country’s economy minister also said that the government had no set target for the franc.In addition, the greenback was down against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD shedding 0.19% to hit 0.9763, AUD/USD climbing 0.29% to hit 1.0715 and NZD/USD rising 0.32% to hit 0.8557.In Canada, official data showed earlier that gross domestic product rose more-than-expected in June, but contracted unexpectedly in the second quarter.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, slipped 0.06% to hit 74.00.Earlier Wednesday, the Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods increased 2.4% after falling by a revised 0.4% in June. Analysts had expected orders to increase by 1.9% after a previously reported 0.8% fall in June.The data came after payroll processing firm ADP said non-farm private employment rose by a seasonally adjusted 91K in August, falling short of expectations for an increase of 103K. A separate report showed that manufacturing activity in the Chicago area fell less-than-expected in August, but still slumped to the lowest level since November 2009.              ]]></raw>
