The Fed's November meeting is now the market's focal point,and minutes from its meeting on Sept. 21, when it said it stoodready to provide more support for the economy and expressedconcern about low inflation, are due at 1800 GMT. * The Australian  dollar fell from nearthree-decade highs seen last week to $0.9792, but many tradersstill see the currency on track to hit parity and put Tuesday'sfalls down to short term profit taking.  * Gold edged lower pressured by a stronger dollar, butexpectations of further monetary easing by the U.S. FederalReserve are likely to support the bull run in bullion. Spotgold  inched down $1.6 to $1,351.35 an ounce in earlytrading reversing gains in the previous session. * Asian stocks dipped slightly with the MSCI Asia ex-Japanindex  down 0.87 percent in early trade. * China's central bank auctioned 22 billion yuan ($3.3billion) of one-year bills in its open market operation onTuesday at a yield of 2.0929 percent, unchanged from the lastsale and in line with market expectations. [nTST000508] Traders had expected the People's Bank of China to keep theone-year bill yield steady because of its reluctance to sendany market signals that it wants to lift benchmark interestrates. * The euro was down 0.2 percent in early trading at $1.3853 with one market player noting stops building in the$1.3830-35 area. * The dollar index  was up 0.12 percent at 77.531,still close to its lowest in nearly nine months.
