<raw><![CDATA[ By Gavin Jones ROME, May 26 (Reuters) - Italy's cabinet approved anausterity package on Tuesday to cut the deficit by 25 billioneuros in 2011 and 2012 with the aim of lowering it to 2.7percent of gdp in 2012 from 5.3 percent last year. Here are some key measures of the 54-article plan, whichPrime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said was based largely onspending cuts and a crackdown on tax evasion and welfare fraud.   SPENDING CUTS * Cuts in funding to city and regional governments. EconomyMinister Giulio Tremonti said these would amount to 4.5 billioneuros per year, which he classified as "substantial but notunsustainable". * Three-year freeze on public sector pay rises. * Cuts for three years in public sector hiring, replacingonly one employee for every five who leave. * Progressive pay cuts of up to 10 percent for high earnersin the public sector, including ministers and parliamentarians. * Delays of three months or six months in retirement forthose who reach retirement age in 2011. * Indexing of retirement age to average national lifeexpectancy from 2015. * 10 percent cut per year in 2011 and 2012 in spending byall government ministries.  * Abolition of provincial governments of areas with fewerthan 220,000 inhabitants. * Elimination of 27 publicly-funded institutions, includingISAE, which conducts Italy's consumer and business confidencesurveys. ISAE's tasks will pass to the economy ministry.  REVENUE-RAISING * Partial amnesty for people with houses they have notdeclared to the authorities. * A crackdown on tax evasion and false benefit claims. This includes: -- 100,000 checks per year in 2010, rising to 200,000 in2011 and 2012 on claims for invalidity pensions. -- A ban on cash payments for sums above 5,000 euros,lowering the ceiling from a previous level of 12,500 euros. * Tightening tax on stock options and bonuses, in line withG20 guidelines.  INCENTIVES FOR COMPETITIVENESS * Tax breaks for companies investing in Italy'sunderdeveloped south. * Measures to link salary increases to rises inproductivity, in a bid to eliminate Italy's wideningcompetitiveness gap with major EU partners. * Allowing foreign companies investing in Italy to apply thetax regime of any European Union country. * Creation of "zero bureaucracy" zones in southern Italywhich will cut down on red tape.  WHEN WILL THE MEASURES TAKE EFFECT? The vast majority will take effect in 2011. A few will bebrought forward to 2010.  WHAT ARE ITALY'S MOST RECENT ECONOMIC FORECASTS? Following are the government's multi-year targets issued onMay 6. Previous forecasts, issued in January, are in brackets.               2010            2011             2012GDP               1.0%  (1.1%)    1.5%   (2.0%)    2.0%  (2.0%)DEFICIT/GDP       5.0%  (5.0%)    3.9%   (3.9%)    2.7%  (2.7%)DEBT/GDP        118.4% (116.9%) 118.7% (116.5%)  117.2% (114.6%)PRIMARY BALANCE* -0.4%  (-0.1%)   1.0%  (1.3%)     2.5%  (2.7%)UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 8.7%   (8.4%)    na   (8.3%)     8.2%  (8.0%)TAX/GDP RATIO    42.8%           42.4%            42.3%  *excludes debt servicing costs  HOW URGENT IS DEFICIT REDUCTION FOR ITALY? Italy has been spared the worst of the market volatilitysince Greece's debt crisis exploded, thanks mainly to thecautious fiscal policy of Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti,meaning it is now under less pressure to adopt draconian cuts. Italy shunned large-scale stimulus during the recession of2008 and 2009 and its deficit, at a projected 5 percent of GDPin 2010, rose far less than in Greece, Spain, Portugal, Irelandor Britain, which are all in or close to double digits. However Italy remains vulnerable due to its massive publicdebt of around 118 percent of GDP. Markets and ratings agencieswant evidence that recent rises in the debt can be reversedthrough structural deficit cuts and pro-growth policies.  ARE THE MEASURES SURE TO BE APPROVED? Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has an ample parliamentarymajority, meaning that in theory there should be little threatof the package not being approved. However, Italy's largest trade union, the left-wing CGIL,has already attacked the budget for unfairly hitting the poorestItalians hardest. It announced on Wednesday that it wouldpropose a four-hour general strike in June in protest. Berlusconi's popularity has been dropping for months due tocoalition bickering, corruption scandals and a growing awarenessof the size of deficit cuts needed. There is a risk that discontent over the cuts could increasegovernment instability, raise the chance of early elections oreven lead Berlusconi to row back on some of the measures. However, senior members of the Berlusconi's centre-rightcoalition, including the leader of the pro-autonomy NorthernLeague Umberto Bossi, have defended the measures as necessary.  -- For the text of the measures in Italian, click on[http://www.tesoro.it/]             ]]></raw>
