<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro retreats from four-month high vs dollar * CHF stumbles, lower oil prices trim safe-haven demand * Analysts see room for short-term euro correction  (Adds comment, updates throughout) By Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - The euro slipped versus thedollar on Tuesday, pausing from a rally spurred by expectationsof a euro zone interest rate rise and raising the possibility ofa downward correction on concerns about euro zone debt problems. An early slide in oil prices also encouraged investors topare back long positions in the Swiss franc -- which has gainedbroadly from safe haven buying throughout the political uprisingin Libya.  The dollar jumped as much as 1 percent against the Swissfranc  while the euro lost steam after rallying to afour-month high above $1.40 on expectations the European CentralBank may raise interest rates next month. Near-term support isseen at $1.3862, the previous three-month peak hit in earlyFebruary. "As oil has come off people have squared some of theirpositions and now we could see the euro continue to edge a bitlower," said Adrian Schmidt, currency strategist at Lloyds. With a euro zone rate rise in April largely priced in andpositioning data showing currency speculators have ramped uptheir long euro positions, some in the market say the euro isripe for a short-term correction. [IMM/FX] However, traders said buying by sovereign accounts helped tocap the euro's losses, while options expiries due at 1500 GMT,including at $1.3900, $1.3990 and $1.4000, may keep it hemmedwithin a range until then. The euro  fell 0.4 percent to $1.3905, extending aretreat from a four-month high around $1.4036 hit on Monday.Traders said stop-loss orders were triggered on the break of$1.3940 and $1.3925, with more reported at $1.3885.  "We're seeing continued EUR/USD selling from the real moneycommunity. It feels like the market wants to target1.3880-1.3850," a London-based trader said. Following a break of the $1.3862 February peak, the nexttechnical level was $1.3830, the low hit on Thursday before ECBPresident Jean-Claude Trichet's hawkish comments at a newsconference after a policy meeting. Below there, the euro couldbe heading towards $1.35. Euro zone countries are ironing out measures to resolve theregion's debt crisis in time for a European Union summit onMarch 24-25. They will meet at a preliminary summit on Fridayand any sign leaders are struggling to reach a consensus on a debt rescue fund could trigger more profit taking in the euro. "We have constructive expectations for reform of the EUfinancial stability fund. If those aren't realised, we could seenegativity on the euro in the short term," said Carl Hammer,currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm. Analysts at Credit Agricole said a lack of consensus laterthis month could trigger selling in the euro. It expects thesingle currency to trade at $1.27 by May.  SWISSIE STRUGGLES Oil prices  stabilised on Tuesday after Kuwait's oilminister said OPEC was in talks to boost oil production,although concerns remained about possible further disruptions inoil supplies due to unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. Analysts said this triggered selling in the Swiss franc,with traders also citing franc selling by Middle Eastern names.  The dollar jumped as much as 1 percent against the Swissfranc to 0.9354 francs, before pulling back to 0.9326 by 1236GMT. The euro  traded at 1.2969 francs, having hit atwo-week high of 1.3040 francs. "There's been stabilisation of oil prices ... so there's abacking off in risk aversion related to Middle East tension,"said Adam Meyers, senior currency strategist at Credit Agricole. "That backing off has caused the Swiss franc to slide." A weaker franc and euro helped prod the dollar  up 0.4percent against a currency basket to 76.779. The index hoveredabove 76.40, where key trendline support dating back to March2008 lay. (Additional reporting by Jessica Mortimer; Editing by SusanFenton)             ]]></raw>
