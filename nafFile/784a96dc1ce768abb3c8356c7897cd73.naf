<raw><![CDATA[Dollar rises vs. rivals with U.S. data in focus    Investing.com - The dollar was broadly higher against the other major currencies on Thursday, as investors eyed the release of U.S. data later in the day after positive economic reports earlier in the week boosted demand for the greenback.During European morning trade, EUR/USD slipped 0.22% to 1.3728. The greenback remained supported after the Conference Board on Tuesday said that its index of U.S. consumer confidence improved to 78.1 in December from 72.0 in November. Analysts had expected the index to rise to 76.0 this month. The data came after Standard & Poor’s with Case-Shiller said that its house price index rose at an annualized rate of 13.6% in October from a year earlier, the strongest pace since February 2006 and above forecasts for an increase of 13%.  The strong reports added to expectations for further stimulus tapering by the Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank will start reducing its bond-buying stimulus program by USD10 billion a month in January, amid indications of an improving U.S. economy.  In the euro zone, Markit research group said its final manufacturing purchasing managers' index for the bloc remained unchanged at 52.7 last month, in line with expectations.  A separate report showed that Germany's manufacturing PMI rose to a 30-month high of 54.3 in December, from a reading of 54.2 the previous month. Analysts had expected the index to remain unchanged last month. The pound was steady against the dollar, with GBP/USD down 0.05% to 1.6552.  Markit also said its U.K. manufacturing PMI fell to 57.3 last month from a reading of 58.1 in November. Analysts had expected the manufacturing PMI to ease down to 58.0 in December. Elsewhere, the greenback was higher against the yen and the Swiss fracn, with USD/JPY up 0.07% to 105.36 and with USD/CHF climbing 0.54% to 0.8970.

The export-related currencies came under pressure after a report earlier showed that China’s final HSBC PMI inched down to 50.5 in December from a reading of 50.8 in November.The data was published one day after a government report showed that China’s manufacturing PMI fell to a four-month low of 51.0 last month from 51.4 in November and worse than forecasts for a decline to 51.2. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.16% to 80.29.  Later in the day, the U.S. was to produce weekly jobless claims data as well as a report by the Institute of Supply Management on manufacturing activity.             ]]></raw>
