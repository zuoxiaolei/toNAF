<raw><![CDATA[ (Updates with closing prices, adds quote and auction) By Daren Butler ISTANBUL, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Turkish shares fell onWednesday, weighed down by losses in index-heavy banks, asinvestors cashed in on the sector's 24 percent rise since theend of June and after Moody's said it will review ratings. Bonds held steady after gains which took the benchmark bondyield to a record low of 9.92 percent on Tuesday after a tap ofthe bond lured strong demand on expectations that Turkey'saggressive interest rate-cutting cycle will continue. The ISE National 100 index fell 1.78 percent to 43,899.44,paring this week's gain to 3 percent. The main share index hasrallied almost 20 percent since the end of June. Banks, which account for about 40 percent of the benchmarkindex, fell for a second day following a Moody's InvestorServices statement on Tuesday that it has put Turkish banks onreview, mainly for their local-currency deposits. Garanti Bank, the third-biggest listed bank, fell 2.78percent to 5.25 lira before it released its results after themarket's close. Garanti posted net profit of 769 million lira inthe second quarter, beating an average forecast of 741 millionlira in a Reuters poll. Yapi Kredi, the lender part-owned by Italy's UniCredit SpA,was among the biggest losers on the exchange, falling 6.13percent to 3.06 lira. Analysts said Tuesday'sstronger-than-expected earnings failed to justify the share'srecent gains. Analysts also cited a rise in bad loans and provisions onits balance sheet as factors weighing on the stock. Koc Holding, Yapi Kredi's main owner, fell 4.92 percent. Media-to-energy group Dogan Holding jumped 8.87 percent to1.35 lira after it said it was in talks with OMV on the sale ofits stake in fuel retailer Petrol Ofisi, which climbed 8.73percent to 6.85 lira. A sale would bring much-needed cash for the embattled DoganHolding, whose media unit Dogan Yayin is facing some $500million in tax fines, said Hasan Sener, an analyst at OyakSecurities. OMV is the second-biggest stake holder in PetrolOfisi. Dogan Yayin and Hurriyet Gazetecilik, a newspaper publisher,rose 2 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively. Turkish Airlines rose more than 9 percent before closing up7.5 percent at 2.58 lira on hopes of wider expansion aftersaying it would start flying to Australia in 2011.  Its growth strategy has captured investors' attention at atime when the rest of the aviation sector is shrinking, nearlytripling the value of its shares this year, said Onur Mutlu,head of research at Gedik in Istanbul. Investors also expect Turkish Airlines to post an increasein its second-quarter profit when it reports earnings at the endof the month, Mutlu said. The lira firmed to 1.457 against the dollar on the interbankmarket, versus the previous day's 1.467.  The Central Bank bought $30 million at a forex-purchaseauction on Wednesday against bids of $185 million, bank datashowed. The bank introduced the auctions on Tuesday as the lirahit a 10-month high against the dollar. The benchmark May 11, 2011, bond yield was flat at 10.09percent. The Treasury on Tuesday sold 843.5 million lira of the May11, 2011, benchmark at an average yield of 10.1 percent, lowerthan a forecast of 10.35 percent, and giving a fresh boost togovernment paper in the secondary market. "The combined results of the auctions this week ... suggestthat concerns over the Treasury's ability to fund a wider budgetdeficit this year have been overdone," said Royal Bank ofScotland analyst Timothy Ash. "It also suggests that foreigners, largely underinvested inTurkish local markets, are beginning to step up to the plate andput money to work in Turkey," Ash said.
