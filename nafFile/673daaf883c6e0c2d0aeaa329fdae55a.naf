<raw><![CDATA[ * Production up 0.9 pct mth/mth, 4.1 pct year/year * Year-on-year increase biggest since April 2008 * Manufacturers seen boosting GDP, consumers weak  (Updates with analysts' quotes, background, graphics) By Marcin Grajewski BRUSSELS, April 14 (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial outputrose much more than expected in February, data showed onWednesday, highlighting the manufacturing sector's strong rolein economic recovery. Industrial production in the 16-country currency blocincreased 0.9 percent from January, European Union statisticsoffice Eurostat said. Output rose 4.1 percent year-on-year, thebiggest jump since April 2008. [ID:nBRLEFE60A] Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expectedproduction to remain unchanged in February from the previousmonth and increase 2.7 percent year-on-year. The figures increased expectations that the euro zoneeconomy expanded in the first quarter of 2010 on the back ofrising exports in countries such as Germany, after it stagnatedin the final three months of last year. "The euro zone manufacturing sector has clearly had a verydecent start to 2010, suggesting that it will have helped eurozone GDP growth improve appreciably in the first quarter," saidHoward Archer, chief European analyst at IHS Global Insight. Like many other regions, the euro zone is emerging from theworst economic crisis in decades. Private consumption, however,remains weak due to increasing unemployment. Detailed figures showed February production was driven by ajump in intermediate and capital goods, which rose 1.5 percentand 0.9 percent month-on-month respectively.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^For graphics comparing euro zone industrial production and GDP:http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/10/04/EZ_IPD0410.gif^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  WEAK CONSUMER DEMAND But durable consumer goods fell by 0.6 percent whilenon-durable consumer goods declined 0.2 percent, suggestingcontinued weakness in private demand. Analysts say householdconfidence needs to improve for growth to become sustainable. "With the global recovery set to slow later this year andprecious few signs of a pick-up in domestic demand, theindustrial recovery could soon begin to falter," said Ben May,analyst at Capital Economics. Eurostat revised the January production figures to plus 1.6percent month-on-month and plus 1.0 percent annually fromprevious readings of 1.7 percent and 1.4 percent respectively. The data is unlikely to have much impact on the decisions ofthe European Central Bank, however, which is expected to leaveits main interest rate at a historic low of 1.0 percent asinflation remains subdued. "While encouraging, the further healthy rise in euro zoneindustrial production is unlikely to markedly influence theECB's policy stance," said Archer. In Germany, the biggest euro zone economy, industrialproduction increased by 6.8 percent annually. France, the secondbiggest, saw it expand by 3.2 percent. Greece and Spain, hitespecially hard by the crisis, registered annual falls of 10.4percent and 1.9 percent respectively. In the whole 27-nation European Union, production rose 0.7percent month-on-month for an annual gain of 3.5 percent. (Editing by Mike Peacock)             ]]></raw>
