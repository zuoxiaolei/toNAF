The euro had earlier risen above $1.40 but failed again tohold above that level. Analysts said the risk of a near-termcorrection in euro/dollar is building, even though investorscontinue to sell the dollar on any rallies. Minutes of the Fed's September meeting showed officialsthought the struggling U.S. recovery might soon need more help.They discussed ways to provide it, including adopting aprice-level target and buying longer-term U.S. government debt.For details, see [ID:nN12188145] More Fed easing means more cheap dollars in the market andlow U.S. rates eroding the return on dollar-denominatedassets. "With the FOMC minutes validating the market's expectationsfor stimulus in November, investors have jumped back into themarket to sell dollars," said Kathy Lien, director of currencyresearch at GFT in New York. Some analysts said the euro's struggle above $1.40 is asign that much of the impact from any further Fed easing hasbeen priced in, with the market already very short of dollars. "For investors to sell the U.S. dollar even further andpush (euro/dollar) above $1.40, we need to see additionalnegative U.S. dollar development, which is currently absent,"said Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC CapitalMarkets in Toronto.

AUSSIE, SWISSIE AT NEW HIGHS Technical analysts said the risk of a near-term pullback inthe euro is increasing. That could push euro/dollar to$1.3690/40, followed by $1.3490, the 23.6 percent and 38.2percent retracements of the euro's move higher from September. But a firm break above $1.4025-45 in euro/dollar,particularly a weekly close above $1.4030, could spark furthergains, others said. The euro may be moving closer to a sell signal on thedollar with the 12- and 26-day moving average convergencedivergence line closing on the nine-day signal line, accordingto Reuters data. The MACD was last at +0.0258, with the signalline at +0.0241. The MACD is used in technical analysis as an indicator ofshort-term momentum by focusing on exponential moving averagesand closing prices. The market has gone very short of dollars on easingexpectations recently and some analysts say this raises therisk of a rebound, particularly if the Fed opts for a muchsmaller QE program than the $1 trillion in asset purchases someforecast.
