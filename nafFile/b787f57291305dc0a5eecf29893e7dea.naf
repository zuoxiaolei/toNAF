<raw><![CDATA[ * Chinese advisers say yuan reform still on track * Focus is on China's needs, including controllinginflation * Foreign criticism of yuan policy quieter in wake ofGreece By Simon Rabinovitch and Aileen Wang BEIJING, May 5 (Reuters) - Greece's debt woes give Chinagood reason to proceed cautiously with currency reform, but,barring a crisis that shakes Europe, should not stand in theway of a resumption of appreciation, government advisers saidon Wednesday. Chinese officials have steadfastly argued that globaluncertainties argue against a big rise in the yuan's exchangerate, a position that the Greek worries are serving tounderline. "China has to take the global economic environment intoconsideration in reforming the yuan's exchange rate. The Greececrisis will definitely have an impact, but, overall, itshouldn't be that big," said Ding Zhijie, a professor at theUniversity of International Business and Economics in Beijing. "First and foremost, the focus for yuan reform is still onChina's own needs," said Ding, who advises the government. Beijing has held the yuan steady at about 6.83 to thedollar since mid-2008, an attempt to cushion its economy fromthe global financial crisis that has faced heavy foreigncriticism. With Chinese inflation accelerating and exports recovering,many economists have predicted that the government couldunshackle the yuan before the end of June, around the time of aSino-U.S. summit this month or a G20 meeting next month. Investors have been betting on about a 3 percent yuan riseover the next year, though expectations for appreciation haveweakened this week on fears that an international rescuepackage for Greece could fall short of what is needed. STILL ON COURSE But Zhang Yansheng, head of the economic research instituteunder the National Development and Reform Commission, apowerful planning agency, said the European turbulence wouldnot blow Beijing off course. "China will carry out yuan reform exclusively according toits own plan. The pace of reform will not be overly affected byexternal factors such as the Greek debt crisis," he said. "Thecost of labour, land and resources are the key factors forChina to consider when implementing yuan reform." Economists at China International Capital Corp, thecountry's largest investment bank, said in a note to clientsthis week that the government was likely to let the yuan risethis quarter as part of a moderate tightening of monetarypolicy. But these plans could be upset if Greek debt troubles takea turn for the worse and contaminate other European countries,they added. MUTED CRITICISM For the time being, China appears to have reaped apolitical dividend from Greece's woes. Earlier this year, with the worst of the financial crisisseemingly in the past, China faced a barrage of calls fromabroad to abandon its de facto currency peg. This criticism hasbeen more muted recently. When European Commission President Jose Manuel Barrosovisited Beijing last week, he emphasised that China hadconfidence in the euro rather than to question its yuan policy. It does not hurt that the yuan has strengthened steadilysince late last year in trade-weighted terms, tracking thedollar higher against most currencies. However, this will not make China complacent and thegovernment is still focused on how to reform its currencyregime, said Ding of the University of International Businessand Economics. "Pressure for yuan appreciation will remain, but the sourceof that pressure will change. As the global economic structurechanges, it will not just be developed nations, but alsodeveloping nations that want this," he said. "China will have to be proactive in confronting this,including starting up yuan appreciation again." (Editing by Jan Dahinten)             ]]></raw>
