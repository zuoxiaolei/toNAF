<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro remained moderately higher against the U.S. dollar on Friday, as demand for the greenback was weighed by data showing that the U.S. economy expanded at a slower rate than expected in the last quarter.   EUR/USD hit 1.3048 during European afternoon trade, the session high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3029, adding 0.14%.   The pair was likely to find support at 1.2956, the low of April 24 and resistance at 1.3094, Thursday's high.   In a preliminary report, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said that U.S. gross domestic product rose 2.5% in the first quarter, less than the expected 3.0% increase, after a 0.4% rise in the previous quarter.   But the euro remained under pressure amid speculation over a possible rate cut by the European Central Bank after Goldman Sachs on Thursday said it now expects the ECB to cut rates by 0.25% at next week's policy meeting.The investment bank also revised down its euro zone growth forecast for 2013 to minus 0.7% from minus 0.5% previously.   Markets were also eyeing a series of new growth measures to be unveiled by the Spanish government, a day after official data showed that the unemployment rate ticked up to 27.2% in the first quarter, from 26.0% in the previous quarter, compared to expectations for a rise to 26.5%.   The euro was lower against the pound with EUR/GBP slipping 0.23%, to hit 0.8411.   Later in the day, the University of Michigan was to produce revised data on consumer sentiment and inflation expectations.             ]]></raw>
