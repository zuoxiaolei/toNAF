<raw><![CDATA[ * Students in Thala reignite wave of protest * Authorities pledge $4.5 bln jobless reduction plan * Hackers attack government websites  (Recasts with gov't plan, hackers' attack, background) By Tarek Amara TUNIS, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Tunisian police used tear gas todisperse a protest by hundreds of students on Tuesday in a townin the west of the country, witnesses said, as violent protestsbroke out again after a brief lull. "Hundreds of students took to the streets this morning insolidarity with the youths of Sidi Bouzid. Jobless (people) soonjoined the protests which turned into clashes with the police,who used tear gas to disperse the protesters," eyewitnessBelgacem Saihi said from Thala, where the protest took place. Tunisian officials could not immediately comment on theaccount given by Saihi, but it was confirmed by Jamal Boulabi,who heads the teachers' union in Thala. Boulabi said students from Thala's four colleges took partin the protest. "They (police) are now surrounding teachers andstudents inside our college, refusing to let anyone leave thecollege ... There are some cases of asphyxiation ... because ofthe tear gas". Clashes started last month in the central town of SidiBouzid after a man in his twenties attempted suicide by settinghimself on fire in front of a government building to protestagainst the confiscation by police of his fruit and vegetablecart. The incident was embraced as a cause celebre by joblessgraduates, unionists and human right activists, and the protestslater spread to other towns including the capital Tunis. Until recently protests have been rare in Tunisia, a countryhailed by Western allies as a model of stability and prosperityin the Arab world, and one which has had only two presidentssince independence from France 55 years ago. According to French media two jobless graduates have triedto kill themselves, at least one dying after electrocutinghimself to protest against "misery and unemployment". Another young Tunisian was killed when police were forced to"shoot in self-defence" to quell rioters in the southern town ofBouziane, the government said.  Tunisia has been ruled for the last 23 years by Zineal-Abidine Ben Ali, who works closely with Western governmentsto combat al Qaeda militants. He is trying to win from the country's main trade partner,the European Union, an 'advanced status' partnership, whichimplies a more scrupulous respect of public freedoms. The government has accused its opponents of manipulating theSidi Bouzid clashes last month to discredit the authorities, andBen Ali later said that violent protests were unacceptable andwould hurt national interests. The wave of protests had died down after Ben Ali named a newyouth minister in a minor government reshuffle -- the second in2010 -- and a new governor for Sidi Bouzid. Official media saidhe had also ordered that 6.5 billion dinars ($4.5 billion) bemobilised to cut graduate unemployment, now around 25 percent. Tunisia has become a regional focus of attention forfinancial institutions since announcing a plan to completecurrent account convertibility during 2010-12, and full dinarconvertibility in 2013-14. Security technology company Sophos said on Monday that"hacktivists" from a group calling itself 'Anonymous' had strucksome official Tunisian websites, including those of Ben Ali, thegovernment and the Tunisian stock exchange. The attack was in "retaliation" for what the group called"war on free speech and democracy" and the blocking by Tunisiaof access to secret U.S. embassy cables released by WikiLeaks. "Your citizens rally in the streets to demand accountabilityand their own rights, which you have wrongfully presumed it wasin your purview to take from them," the group said in astatement posted on several websites. Asked to confirm the Sophos report, an official at theTunisian information technology regulator said "There is aproblem but we don't know yet what it is all about. It's beyondus".
