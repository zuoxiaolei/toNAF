<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro hits 6-mth high $1.3242, dollar falls broadly * Dlr index hits weakest since April, dlr/yen at 8-mth low * U.S. currency smacked by low U.S. rate view, tech factors  (Adds comment, updates prices) By Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The dollar hit multi-month lowsagainst major currencies on Tuesday, stung by speculation thatU.S. interest rates will stay low, while technical factors keptthe currency under selling pressure. The dollar index, a measure of its value against a currencybasket, fell to 80.539, its weakest since mid-April and markingits first break since January below its 200-day moving average,a move that analysts said would open the door to more losses. The euro hit a six-month high of $1.3242 according toReuters data, while the dollar fell to 85.86 yen, its weakestsince November 2009. Negative sentiment for the U.S. currency grew after FederalReserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Monday that the economyhas yet to recover fully and monetary policy must remainaccommodative. Also stinging the dollar was the two-year U.S. Treasuryyield's drop to a record low 0.534 percent. It has fallen fasterthan its euro zone counterpart, further weakening demand forshort-term U.S. debt and reflecting the market's view that U.S.rates will stay low. "The jury is still out on the U.S. recovery in Q2, Q3 andQ4, but the market is taking the more pessimistic view," saidKenneth Broux, market strategist at Lloyds TSB. The greenback has slid over the past month after a run ofdisappointing U.S. data fuelled expectations that U.S. growthcould lose momentum as official stimulus is withdrawn. The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported that, givensigns the economy is losing momentum, Fed officials will mullwhether to use cash the central bank receives from maturingmortgage bond holdings to buy new mortgage or Treasury bonds,rather than allowing its portfolio to shrink gradually. By 0940 GMT, the dollar index traded at 80.598, down 0.4percent on the day, after breaking below its 200-day movingaverage at around 80.722 according to Reuters data. The euro traded 0.4 percent higher at $1.3230, while theU.S. currency was 0.5 percent lower at 86.03 yen.  AUSSIE TRIMS LOSSES Technical analysts said the euro's break above a Fibonacciretracement level against the dollar on Monday was adding to thecommon currency's upward momentum. "Technically, we've broken levels that should have held ifwe were to be trending south in euro/dollar," said Dag Muller,technical strategist at SEB in Stockholm, adding he saw a climbto $1.33 in the near term. The euro's break was through $1.3125, the 38.2 percentretracement of its decline from November to June. Having made adecisive break above that level, investors focused on $1.3510,the 50 percent retracement of the November-June move. The euro raced higher in early European trade, but gainspetered out in the lower $1.32 region, keeping the singlecurrency hovering around where options at $1.32, $1.3220 and$1.3250 were seen expiring later in the day. The Australian dollar traded at $0.9110, down 0.2 percent onthe day but trimming losses made after retail sales and buildingapprovals data in Australia disappointed bulls. The RBA held its benchmark interest rate at 4.5 percent, aswidely expected, and some traders covered Aussie shortsfollowing a lack of negative surprises in the RBA's statement,which said policy was appropriate given moderating inflation anduncertainty about the global outlook.
