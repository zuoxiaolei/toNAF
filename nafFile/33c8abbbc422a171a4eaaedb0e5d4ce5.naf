<raw><![CDATA[ * SVP to propose new rules in parliament next week * Blocher already called for SNB head to quit * Other parties accuse SVP of electioneering  ZURICH, March 6 (Reuters) - The popular right-wing SwissPeople's Party (SVP) wants to limit the autonomy of the SwissNational Bank (SNB) on decisions outside its core mandate ofprice stability after big losses on currency interventions. "If the SNB leaves its actual mission with large currencybuys, one must be able to supervise the SNB bosses and ifnecessary stop them," Christoph Blocher, former justice ministerand SVP mastermind, told the SonntagsZeitung newspaper. Blocher has already called on SNB chief Philipp Hildebrandto resign after the central bank posted a 2010 loss of 19.2billion Swiss francs ($20.74 billion) after ill-fatedinterventions to try to fight the currency's strength. The SVP, expected to remain Switzerland's biggest party innational elections in October, plans a motion proposing newrules in parliament next week to control the central bank. "In extreme cases, currency buys can be necessary to secureprice stability. That is why we need disciplinary supervisoryrules to prevent the managing board contravening their coremandate and taking on unbelievable risks," Blocher said. The SNB has repeatedly defended the interventions as beingnecessary to fight deflation risk from the soaring franc. Blocher also accused Hildebrand of being too much in favourof more integration with the European Union. "I have the suspicion that Mr Hildebrand wants to play arole at the European or even global level. He pleads for openingand integration which does not belong to his area of competency.He also doesn't rule out tying the franc to the euro," he said. However, the other main parties in the coalition governmentthat rules Switzerland have defended the SNB's currencyinterventions and the central bank's independence. Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann said in aninterview with the Finanz und Wirtschaft newspaper on Saturdaythat the SNB had managed to dampen the franc's rise somewhat andsaid the situation had improved in the meantime. Otto Ineichen from the liberal Free Democrats told theSonntag newspaper the SVP was going too far with its electioncampaign and was defaming the SNB with "false accusations". The safe-haven franc has soared to record highs against theeuro and the dollar due to unrest in north Africa and the eurozone's debt crisis, prompting calls for the government tointervene as Swiss exporters suffer. The Swiss government has announced measures to help firms todeal with the strong Swiss franc, including increased fundingfor the tourism industry and support for companies to boostinnovation.
