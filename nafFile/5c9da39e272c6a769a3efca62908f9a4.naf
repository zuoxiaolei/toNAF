<raw><![CDATA[ * Risk premiums on Spanish, Italian, Belgian debt spike * Citigroup sees default worries spreading beyond euro zone * Padoa-Schioppa says markets "very nervous" * Euro sinks below $1.30 for first time since mid-Sept  (Adds quotes, details throughout) By Andrei Khalip and Noah Barkin LISBON/DUBLIN, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The euro zone's debtcrisis deepened on Tuesday as investors pushed the spreads onSpanish, Italian and Belgian bonds to euro lifetime highs andPortugal warned of "intolerable risks" facing its banks. The euro dipped below $1.30 for the first time sincemid-September, immune to new attempts by European policymakersto calm markets hell-bent on testing the EU's determination toshield its financially weak members and increasingly nervousabout the possibility of future euro zone defaults. Two days after the bloc approved an 85 billion euro ($111.7billion) emergency aid package for Ireland, worries aboutcontagion to Portugal and Spain persisted and the borrowingcosts of large countries like Italy and France shot higher. Markets are already discounting an eventual rescue ofPortugal although the government in Lisbon denies, as Irishleaders initially did, that the country needs outside aid. While a Portuguese rescue would be manageable, assistancefor its larger neighbour Spain would sorely test EU resources,raise deeper questions about the integrity of the 12-year oldcurrency area, and possibly spread contagion beyond Europe. Italy, the euro zone's third largest economy, is now beingreferred to as "too big to fail" and "too big to bail". Citigroup Chief Economist Willem Buiter described theturbulence hitting the euro zone as an "opening act" andpredicted that sovereign default fears could soon extend toJapan and the United States. "There is no such thing as an absolutely safe sovereign," hewrote in a research note. Tomasso Padoa-Schioppa, a former Italian finance ministerand ECB member who is advising Greece's government, admittedthat markets were "very nervous", describing worries about Spainand other large euro members as "excessive". The euro dipped below $1.30 and has now shed more than 7percent of its value against the dollar since early November.The yield spreads of 10-year Spanish, Italian and Belgian bondsover German benchmarks spiked to their highest levels since thebirth of the euro in January 1999. The iTraxx SovX index of western European credit defaultswap prices rose to an all-time high above 200 basis points asthe cost of protecting against a euro zone sovereign debtdefault surged. "It's very worrying because Spain is almost too big to bebailed out ... whereas Italy is too big to be bailed out," saidEverett Brown, European bond strategist at IDEAglobal. Jitters also hit European banking shares, which were ledlower by French banks BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and CreditAgricole on market rumours Standard & Poor's might cut France'soutlook -- talk swiftly denied by the government in Paris. "There is no reason for concern, no risk," said FrancoisBaroin, budget minister and government spokesman.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  For an interactive timeline on the Eurozone debt crisis in  2010, click on http://link.reuters.com/nyx95q   For Take a Look on euro debt crisis, click  For multimedia coverage on the Euro Zone Crisis page on Top  News: http://r.reuters.com/hus75h  For graphic on debt crunch, click http://r.reuters.com/zem66q  For Breakingviews column on the crisis, click ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  "INTOLERABLE RISK" Deepening the sense of gloom, Portugal's central bank warnedthat its country's banks faced an "intolerable risk" if thegovernment in Lisbon failed to consolidate public finances. Although the minority Socialist government in Portugalapproved an austerity budget for 2011 last week, it isstruggling to meet its targets for deficit reduction, with thecore state sector shortfall widening 1.8 percent in the first 10months of this year. The worry is that troubles in Portugal could spread quicklyto Spain because of their close economic ties. Data released on Tuesday underscored economic divergenceswithin the euro zone, which pose an increasing challenge to theEuropean Central Bank and its one-size-fits-all monetary policy. German unemployment fell in November for a 16th straightmonth while Italy's unemployment rate jumped to 8.6 percent inOctober from 8.3 percent the month before. Greek retail sales plunged 9.9 percent year-on-year inSeptember under the weight of crushing austerity measures agreedin exchange for its 110 billion euro bailout. Ireland faces a daunting task meeting the terms of its ownbailout and cleaning up its battered banks. Irish bank debtspreads continued to widen on Tuesday despite the rescue. In addition to Ireland's bailout, European leaders approvedon Sunday the outlines of a long-term European StabilityMechanism (ESM), based on a Franco-German proposal, that willcreate a permanent bailout facility and make the private sectorgradually share the burden of any future default. Although private bondholders will not be asked to share thecost of debt restructurings until after mid-2013 and then onlyon a case-by-case basis, the mechanism has raised fears offuture defaults and the likelihood of so-called "haircuts" downthe road. Eurointelligence, an online commentary service, said marketswere growing increasingly concerned about the solvency of eurozone peripheral states after focusing mainly on their short-termliquidity problems in past weeks. "We at Eurointelligence consider a default of Greece,Ireland and Portugal a done deal," they wrote on Tuesday. "Thequestion is only now whether Spain can scrape through."
