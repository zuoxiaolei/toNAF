<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar dips to 83.07 yen on EBS; 15-year low * Japan PM Kan wins ruling party leadership vote * German ZEW index takes shine off euro * Dollar falls to 9-mth low vs Swiss franc, below parity  (Adds quotes, updates prices) By Tamawa Desai LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a new 15-yearlow against the yen on Tuesday as Japanese Prime Minister NaotoKan won the ruling party leadership vote, raising speculationTokyo would not act immediately to stem the yen's rise. Kan will keep his job after an unexpectedly decisive victoryover party heavyweight Ichiro Ozawa, who had made more stridentcalls to curb the yen's advance. [ID:nTOE68D06W] By 1120 GMT, the dollar was down 0.6 percent to 83.18 yen,after dipping to 83.07 yen on trading platform EBS. Buying aheadof option barriers at 83.00 yen contained the downside, traderssaid. Stop-loss orders were seen below at 82.85/90 yen. "With the market having positioned for a Kan victory, thescope for considerable further yen appreciation may be limited,"said Derek Halpenny, European head of global currency researchat Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. "The one negative aspect for Kan ... is that he only got50.7 percent of the vote of Diet members. This hardly gives Kana strong mandate for leading the country and we suspect once themarkets focus on this aspect the yen may weaken back a bit."  Still, traders said any dollar rise may be short-lived,with Monday's 84.43 intraday peak seen as the first point ofresistance, due to expectations Japanese exporters would sellmore dollars before their half-year book closing on Sept. 30. "The threat of intervention will hang over the market butwill there be international cooperation? Probably no. So themarket will continue to test Kan's resolve," said Simon Derrick,head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon. Analysts said if the dollar falls past 83 yen and hits 82yen in a couple of hours, the risk of intervention would risedramatically. "With the political drama out of the way, economics willdrive intervention and if there is a rapid appreciation youcould see them coming to stop it," said a currency strategist ata Japanese bank.

[ID:nDEP003349] It pared some of Monday's gains made on solid Chinese dataand relief over new Basel III banking rules. A major resistancepoint was seen at $1.2920-30, a level that has blocked thecurrency several times since August. The dollar fell below parity against the Swiss franc to hita nine-month low of 0.9996 francs on EBS, and a one-month lowagainst a basket of currencies .  "The franc was helped by a lot of customer flows fromEurope, investors who are moving away from risk," said PaulRobson, currency strategist at RBS. The dollar index  edged higher to 81.98, bouncing fromits 200-day moving average at 81.761. A clear break below thatcould stoke expectations of further weakness in the U.S.currency. Market players will look to U.S. retail sales data due at1230 GMT and expected to rise 0.3 percent in August from theprevious month. A lower-than-expected reading could triggerfurther yen gains against the dollar, some traders said.  (Additional reporting by Anirban Nag; Editing by Susan Fenton)             ]]></raw>
