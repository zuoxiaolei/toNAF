<raw><![CDATA[ * Kirk says NSC has not interfering with China cases * USTR still "studying" WTO case on China currency By Doug Palmer WASHINGTON, Pa. July 30 (Reuters) - President BarackObama's national security advisors have not stopped U.S. tradeofficials from filing legal challenges against China, U.S.Trade Representative Ron Kirk said on Friday. "We've not experienced any instances at all where we havemade a recommendation to the president and there's been anyobjection or interference from the NSC (National SecurityCouncil)," Kirk told reporters after a speech on U.S. tradeenforcement at a specialty steel manufacturer. U.S. trade officials were "studying" the possibility ofbring a WTO challenge against China's currency practices, buthad not made a decision yet, Kirk added. Kirk was asked whether White House national securityofficials, for larger strategic reasons of maintaining goodrelations with China, were blocking three cases that have beenreported to be in the works for months. Kirk insisted his agency "solely has the responsibility tomake decisions on U.S. trade policy," but greatly values theadvice it receives from other agencies, including the NSC andthe White House National Economic Council. The Obama administration has filed just one WTO complaintagainst China since taking office in January 2009. That was brought with the European Union and Mexico againstChinese export restraints on raw materials used to make steel,semi-conductors and other manufactured goods. One of three possible new cases Kirk was asked about onFriday involves a specialty steel product made by AlleghenyTechnologies Inc, which hosted him for his speech. The company's grain-oriented electrical steel, which isused in high-efficiency transformers, electric motors andgenerators, was hit this year with Chinese anti-dumping andcountervailing duties it says are unjustified. The second possible new case would challenge Chinese exportrestraints on rare earths, a raw material used in many advancedtechnology products including defense and clean energy goods. The third would take on China Union Pay's monopoly onelectronic payments in apparent violation of commitments Chinamade when it joined the WTO. "I just don't think it's smart policy to talk aboutspecific cases that we're contemplating," Kirk said, when askedabout the three possible disputes.  However, a second senior U.S. trade official, speaking oncondition that he not be identified, confirmed the USTR has"taken a good close look at each of those." Kirk said the United States hopes to resolve a number oftrade issues with Beijing by the time he and Commerce SecretaryGary Locke host senior Chinese officials in November for theU.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade. He also said the Obama administration would not hesitate toimpose punitive tariffs or take China to the WTO when attemptsto resolve disputes through dialogue fail. However, on one trade issue uppermost in the mind of manylawmakers, Kirk declined to say whether he thought it waspossible to challenge China's currency practices at the WTO. "It is a matter we're studying," he said. Many lawmakers believe China deliberately undervalues itscurrency to give Chinese companies an unfair trade advantage.
