<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen on Thursday, after an unexpected trade surplus and higher-than-forecast exports in Japan added to evidence of a rebound in the world’s third biggest economy.USD/JPY hit 83.14 during early European trade, the pair’s lowest since March 19; the pair subsequently consolidated at 83.16, declining 0.31%.The pair was likely to find support at 82.87, the low of March 14 and resistance at 83.56, the high of March 19.Government data showed earlier that Japan’s trade balance swung into a surplus of JPY32.92 billion in February, confounding expectations for a deficit of JPY120 billion following the downwardly revised deficit of JPY1.47 trillion reported in January.Japan’s Cabinet Office said on Wednesday that the economy is picking up “slowly” after the earthquake and tsunami that devastated northeastern regions in March last year.Meanwhile, sentiment weakened after preliminary data from HSBC showed that China’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 48.1 in March, from a final reading of 49.6 the previous month, as new orders dropped to their lowest level since November.The data underlined concerns over a possible slowdown in growth in the world’s second largest economy.Elsewhere, the yen was higher against the euro with EUR/JPY shedding 0.39%, to hit 109.81.Later in the day, the U.S. was to publish official data on initial jobless claims and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was due to speak.             ]]></raw>
