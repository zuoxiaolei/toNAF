<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro falls; dollar index hits one-month high * Stocks down on bank worries, hitting risk appetite * UK bank shake-up stings sterling; Aussie down after RBA * Federal Reserve's rate announcement on Wednesday awaited(Adds quotes, updates prices, changes byline, changes dateline,previous LONDON) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose to aone-month high against a basket of currencies on Tuesday asconcerns about the global banking sector and weaker equitymarkets boosted the greenback's safe-haven appeal. European shares fell and U.S. stock futures signaled alower open after disappointing results from UBS  and ashake-up of UK banks Lloyds  and Royal Bank of Scotland prompted investors to cut back on risk. "We saw investors focus once again on the health of thebanking sector and that of course has tended to undermineriskier assets," said Omer Esiner, senior market analyst atTravelex Global Business Payments in Washington. "Stocks were generally lower and that has rekindled demandfor safe-haven, low-yielding assets like the dollar and theJapanese yen," he added. In early New York trading, the ICE Futures U.S. dollarindex , a measure of the greenback's value against abasket of six major currencies, rose 0.6 percent to 76.728,after earlier climbing as high as 76.817, its highest levelsince early October. The euro fell about a full percent on the day, hitting afour-week low of $1.4627 , according to Reuters data andreversing Monday's gains made on firm manufacturing data. Some attributed losses in banks shares and the euro partlyto European Commission estimates of bank losses renewinganxiety over the sector's health. The EU Commission quoted results of stress tests in thebanking sector, published in early October, which said lossescould amount to 400 billion euros ($585.2 billion) in2009-2010. The euro fell 0.9 percent  to 132.14 yen whilethe dollar dropped 0.1 percent against to 90.23 yen . Some traders said profit-taking on risk assets, alreadyseen in equities, could materialize ahead of funds'book-closings as the year-end approaches, and that this mayoffer an additional boost to the dollar. "Year-end position liquidation could also prove disruptiveto capital markets as investors crystallize this year's gains,"said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS in London. WARY AHEAD OF FED, JOBS REPORT Traders remained wary ahead of big scheduled events thisweek. The U.S. Federal Reserve starts a two-day policy-settingmeeting on Tuesday and the European Central Bank and the Bankof England also hold policy meetings later in the week.[ECB/INT] [BOE/INT] Key U.S. jobs data is due on Friday. The Fed, which will announce its decision on Wednesday, isexpected to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged nearzero. Investors will focus on the interest rate outlook, butmany analysts say the Fed is unlikely to change the wording ofits pledge to keep rates low for an "extended period". [FED/R] "The banking system is still very soft globally. I don'tthink the Fed is going to be in a big hurry to do anythingabout interest rates going forward and certainly in theirlanguage I don't expect any changes," said Andrew Busch, globalFX strategist at BMO Capital Markets in Chicago. The Australian dollar fell 0.9 percent against the U.S.dollar to US$0.8954 , extending losses after theReserve Bank of Australia raised its cash rate for the secondmonth running as expected, but left markets guessing if itwould raise rates again as soon as December.
