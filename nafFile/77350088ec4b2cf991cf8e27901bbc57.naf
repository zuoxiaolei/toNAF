<raw><![CDATA[ * Spain's downgrade spooks investors ahead of summit * European stocks hit six-week low, euro at one-week low * Weak China February trade fuels growth worries * Brent crude falls below $115; fighting rages in Libya  By Blaise Robinson PARIS, March 10 (Reuters) - European stocks and the eurofell on Thursday as Moody's downgraded Spain, reigniting worriesover the euro zone debt crisis ahead of the bloc's summit andprompting investors to turn to safer bets such as Bunds. Brent crude, which has gained 13 percent over the past threeweeks, dipped below $115 on Thursday, but the retreat waslimited as forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafilaunched an assault on the eastern Libyan oil town of Ras Lanuf,sparking worries about long-term damage to the country's oilinfrastructure. Investors were also fretting about surprisingly weak Chinesetrade data that hit Asian stocks and copper prices. China swung to a trade deficit in February of $7.3 billion-- its largest in seven years -- as the Lunar New Year holidaydealt a sharper blow to export activity than had been expected. "China's trade figures have been a shocker, setting the tonein Asia's trading session. Add to that Spain's credit downgradeand oil prices that aren't retreating, and the glass is now halfempty," said Lionel Jardin, head of institutional sales atGlobal Equities in Paris. Moody's downgraded Spain to Aa2 from Aa1 with a negativeoutlook and warned of further cuts, saying the country's plansto clean up the battered banking sector will cost more than thegovernment expects and add to its debt burden. The move comes a few days after Moody's steep three-notchdowngrade of Greece, fuelling negative sentiment towardsstruggling euro zone sovereign borrowers on the eve of a summitof the currency bloc. "If speculators really hit Portugal hard there would appearto be an increased possibility that Spain will be put back underthe spotlight, but we don't think Spain will need to be bailedout," said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank. The euro hit the day's low around $1.3805, althoughsovereign demand and technical support buffered the currencyagainst more intraday losses. The yield gap between 10-year Spanish yields and equivalentGerman Bunds was 5 basis points wider on the day at 228 bps,after rising to 232 bps earlier. Negative sentiment in the periphery has pushed investors toseek safer trades, and Bund futures rose 27 ticks to 121.86. The10-year Bund yield fell 3.2 basis points to 3.706 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down0.7 percent, hitting a six-week low, while Spain's benchmarkindex IBEX 35 was down 1.3 percent at a near two-month low. World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index were down 0.7 percent. U.S. stock index futures were also in the red, suggesting aweak start for Wall Street. "The recent geopolitical events that have boosted oil pricesare nothing to reassure retail investors, who have been shunningequities," said Philippe Marchessaux, CEO of BNP ParibasInvestment Partners, which has 546 billion euros ($754 billion)under management. "But at the same time, when you look at corporate resultsand equity valuations, stocks are tremendously cheap." The broad MSCI world equity index carries a forwardprice-to-earnings ratio of 12.2, well below a 20-year average of16.6, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. In the UK, the FTSE 100 index extended its losses andsterling slipped in afternoon trading after the Bank ofEngland's Monetary Policy Committee left interest rates on holdat 0.5 percent, as expected.
