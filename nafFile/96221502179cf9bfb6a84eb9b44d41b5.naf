<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro touched three-week highs against the dollar on Tuesday as market sentiment continued to be dominated by the Bank of Japan’s new monetary stimulus program.EUR/USD hit 1.3069 during late Asian trade, the pair’s highest since March 15; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3021, gaining 0.11%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.2967, Monday’s low and resistance at 1.3106, the high of March 15.The BoJ conducted its first government bond purchasing operation on Monday, purchasing JPY1.2 trillion of Japanese government bonds maturing in five years or more.The euro found support as sovereign bond yields across the euro zone fell with investors moving away from Japanese bonds into higher yielding assets.Elsewhere, official data showed that the annual rate of Chinese consumer inflation eased to 2.1% in March from 3.2% in February and below forecasts for 2.4%.The data eased market concerns over further policy tightening by the Chinese government.But weak German trade data for February sparked fresh concerns over the outlook for the euro zone’s largest economy.Government data showed that Germany’s trade surplus widened to EUR17.1 billion from 15.6 billion in January, above expectations for a surplus of EUR15.0 billion.The report said exports fell 1.5% in February, while imports fell by 3.8%.The euro was trading close to its highest level since January 2010 against the yen, with EUR/JPY easing 0.21% to 128.97.             ]]></raw>
