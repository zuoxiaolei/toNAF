<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro assets in broad sell-off as aid package boost fades * Focus on economy, corporate health to stop downward spiral * Euro positioning overstretched  By Natsuko Waki LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - Euro zone assets will come out oftheir downward spiral only when investors shift their focus backto the region's improving economy and unwind overstretchedpositions after weeks of selling. A week after global policymakers announced a $1 trillion aidpackage, the rally in euro-denominated assets has all butfizzled with the euro hitting four-year lows versus the dollaras concerns grow fiscal tightening will hit growth.Arguably, the region's assets are in a lose-lose situation.Even if belt tightening were to fail, the prospect of debtdefault in the peripheral euro zone would resurface again,leading to a sell-off in the currency, stocks and bonds. Against this backdrop, investors have largely neglectedeconomic improvement due to a weak euro and low interest rates.In Germany alone, the economy unexpectedly grew early in 2010,export growth hit near 18-year highs and industrial output rose. Furthermore, the euro countries at the centre of the crisis-- Greece, Spain and Portugal -- make up only 15 percent of eurozone GDP, meaning any hit to overall growth from austeritymeasures would be slight. "We're seeing better European macro but everyone is focusingon the debt situation. Low interest rates will be with us for along time and that should be good for markets," said RichardRobinson, investment manager at Ashburton in Jersey. Credit Suisse cites OECD estimates every 10 percent fall inthe value of the euro adds nearly 0.8 percent to European GDP.The euro has lost nearly 14 percent against the dollar and yen since January. It also estimates 10 percent off the euro's trade-weightedindex will directly add 4 percent to European earnings, giventhat 36 percent of earnings come from outside the region. Emphasising this point, shares in Airbus parent EADS hit an8-month high on Friday on hopes the firm would be able totranslate a recent euro slide into improved profits. Gary Reynolds, chief investment officer at asset managerCourtiers, said investors were underestimating how good theglobal environment was for stocks. "It's a screaming buy. It's true about Europe too."  AMBER LIGHT FOR BEARS Illustrating the scale of risk aversion, the euro has lostnearly 10 U.S. cents this month alone, touching a low of $1.2237, and safe-haven gold hit record highs in various denominations,including the dollar, euro, Swiss franc and sterling. Investors see little respite for the euro even when otherassets bounce as bond buying by the European Central Bank underthe aid package raises the prospect that interest rates willstay low for longer. To make matters worse, such intervention makes it harder forinvestors to express their negative euro zone view in the bondmarket, leaving the euro to bear the brunt. However, amber lights are flashing over euro bears, giventhat speculative bets against the single currency have alreadyswollen to record levels. Risk reversals, which reflect option market bias towards acurrency, for euro/dollar has hit 2.8 percent favouring europuts, their highest since November 2008, after the collapse ofLehman Brothers threw markets into turmoil. Stretched option prices and spot positioning are often anindication that a reversal of the move is on the cards. In addition, too rapid a decline could prompt monetaryauthorities to act. "(The ECB) will not want a collapse in the value of theeuro, which would endanger financial stability in the euro area.The weaker the euro gets, the more investors will start to worryabout the ECB stepping in," Barclays Capital said in a note. "The recent sovereign crisis was important and eurodepreciation is understandable given that it happened, but we donot think that it is likely to carry on for very much longer." The rise in euro zone sovereign concerns come aftergovernments around the world absorbed risks from deleveraging inthe private sector, mainly banks. But policymakers determined tostabilise the market are introducing a two-way risk. "Just as it was, in hindsight, the right thing to do to buycredit at the end of 2008, it might now be the time to buysovereigns as the financing backstop has been put in place,"said Chris Iggo, chief investment officer of fixed income at AXAInvestment Managers.             ]]></raw>
