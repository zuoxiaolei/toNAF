<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The Australian dollar was lower against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday, after the release of disappointing Australian trade balance data, while concerns over the outlook for U.S. ecpnomic growth continued to weigh. AUD/USD hit 1.0473 during late Asian trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.0482, falling 0.21%.  The pair was likely to find support at 1.0450, the low of January 3 and resistance at 1.0528, the high of January 3.  The Aussie came under pressure after official data showed that Australia's trade deficit widened unexpectedly in November, rising to AUD2.64 billion from a deficit of AUD2.44 billion the previous month.  Analysts had expected the trade deficit to narrow to AUD2.30 billion in November. Meanwhile, tepid U.S. nonfarm payrolls data last week dampened speculation that the Federal Reserve may end its easing program sooner than had been expected after the minutes from the Fed’s December meeting showed that some policymakers considered ending the bank’s quantitative easing program before the end of the year.Investor confidence was also hit by concerns about continuing political wrangling in Washington over further budget cuts and raising the U.S. debt ceiling. The Aussie was also lower against the euro with EUR/AUD adding 0.16%, to hit 1.2509. Later in the day, the euro zone was to produce official data on retail sales, as well as on the unemployment rate.             ]]></raw>
