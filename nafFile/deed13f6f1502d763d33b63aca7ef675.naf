<raw><![CDATA[ BRUSSELS, June 17 (Reuters) - European Union leaders gavethe final green light on Thursday for Estonia to join the eurozone next year as its 17th member, a diplomat said. "Estonia has been done," the diplomat said. The decision was seen as a formality after EU financeministers had approved the Baltic republic's bid to adopt thesingle currency, despite tensions on its debt markets. The euro zone is not expected to expand for at least anotherfour years as other candidates -- the Czech Republic, Hungary,Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania and Poland -- fall short ofthe entry criteria, notably due to their large budget deficits.
