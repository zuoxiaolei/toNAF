<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – Last week saw the Australian dollar edge higher against its U.S. counterpart, but fail to gain a toehold above parity, as concerns over the impact of recent floods in Queensland state weighed on the commodity-based economy.AUD/USD hit 1.0021 on Monday, the pair’s highest since January 19; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.9938 by close of trade on Friday, gaining 0.54% over the week.The pair was likely to find support at 0.9874, Thursday’s low and resistance at 1.0021, Monday’s high.On Friday, Australia's Treasurer Wayne Swan said the floods will shave half a percentage point from economic growth in the 2010-11 financial year, while inflation will rise.
