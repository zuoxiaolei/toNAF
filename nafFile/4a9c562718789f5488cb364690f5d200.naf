<raw><![CDATA[ * Bank to resume policy tightening in Q2 or Q3 * Demand for Czech goods to resume to pre-crisis level * This year to record small growth * Growth seen around 3 percent from 2011 on By Jana Mlcochova PRAGUE, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank may beginmonetary policy tightening in the second or the third quarter ofthe year and start with a quarter point hike, central bank boardmember Robert Holman said on Wednesday. Czech interest rates are at a record low, with the maintwo-week repo rate at 1 percent, on par with the euro zone,after seven cuts totalling 275 basis points made over the last17 months.  The bank will update its quarterly inflation forecast at apolicy meeting on Feb. 4, and the new outlook will likelyconfirm the path for rate hikes, Holman said. "A rate increase will probably be consistent with theforecast and I think that roughly in the second of the thirdquarter we will raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point,"Holman told Reuters in an interview. Holman was in a minority voting for stable rates at the lastinterest rate-setting session in December which voted to cut themain rate by 25 basis points. He said he was hesitating until the last moment whether tovote for the cut or for stable rates but decided to stay putmainly because of expectation of resuming rate tightening in"two to three quarters". "I thought the (December) rate lowering was a bit needless.I do not think it has had any effect on the economic situationhere whatsoever... perhaps with the exception of the exchangerate." Most economists said it was the last rate reduction in thepresent easing cycle and a period of stable rates lasting forseveral months was to follow before the bank starts tightening. Governor Zdenek Tuma said earlier this week rates may havereached their lowest in the present easing cycle.  Holman is known for defending a policy of seldom makingchanges to interest rates which he considers detrimental to thecorporate sector, as it complicates companies' financialplanning.  DEMAND TO RECOVER FULLY The Czech economy has probably gone through the worst with ashort recession at the turn of 2008 and 2009. In its lastmacroeconomic forecast from November, the bank sees a W-shapedrecovery, with the second, milder dip coming in the fourthquarter of this year. Singer said on Wednesday growth could reach about 2 percentthis year, above the bank's November forecast of 1.4 percent. Holman said his view of an economic recovery has not changedmarkedly compared to the November forecast. "We expect that a recession in western Europe has ended andthat this will spill over here through increased foreign demand.We can expect a moderate recovery, on average it will be a bitabove zero, moderate economic growth." In the years immediately ahead, growth should be around halfof the pre-crisis pace, about 3 percent, he said. Holman said he expected foreign demand to resume topre-crisis levels after the economic downturn subsides and thecountry's potential output should remain intact. His remarks are contrast to November comments byVice-Governor Mojmir Hampl who said there was a risk the economycould emerge from the crisis with a lower potential output,which could lead to a rise in demand-led price pressures andrates higher than the baseline interest rate trajectory assume.
