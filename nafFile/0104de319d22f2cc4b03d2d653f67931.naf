<raw><![CDATA[ * Priority now is growth, not joining euro -incoming Min * Says euro zone was 'close to collapse', rules have changed * Sees further euro zone woes in next 18-24 months  BUDAPEST, May 13 (Reuters) - The euro zone is in turmoil andHungary's incoming government will focus economic policy thisyear and next on promoting growth rather than on joining thesingle currency, economy minister designate Gyorgy Matolcsy saidon Thursday. Prior to last weekend's $1 trillion rescue deal, "the eurozone reached the brink of collapse," Matolcsy, who takes overthe post later this month, told news portal fn.hu. Amid signs of waning enthusiasm for the single currency inseveral euro candidate countries, he said the new government"will pursue an economic policy whose main peg is not the euroas the rules of the game have changed ... "The first thing here is that we should have growth again." Matolcsy said global policymakers had been wise to hammerout a rescue deal for the euro zone when they did, because"there is terribly big trouble (there)". He said further crises, both large and small, were likely toaffect the single currency area in the next 18-24 months. Estonia remains on track to adopt the euro next year afterwinning European Commission backing for its bid on Wednesday. But Poland's finance minister said Warsaw was in no rush tojoin the bloc, which needed time to "refurbish" after the Greekwoes, and his Icelandic counterpart told Reuters on Wednesdaythat domestic opposition to EU membership was growing.[ID:nLDE64B2DF] The euro fell to a one-week low on Thursday, as loomingfiscal tightening in the euro zone outweighed relief at the aidpackage, which had eased investor worries a Greek sovereign debtcrisis would spread. [ID:nLDE64C0PK] STABLE FORINT Matolcsy, whose Fidesz party secured a two-thirdsparliamentary majority in April's elections, said a week ago theincoming government should be able to set a target date foradopting the euro by the end of 2011. [ID:nLDE6420XT] He told fn.hu on Thursday the country should go its own waythis year and next to create a credible and stable economy byfocusing on reviving growth. Fidesz has promised deep tax cuts to create jobs and helpeconomic growth, and said it would seek agreement withinternational lenders including the IMF and the EU to run ahigher 2010 budget deficit than the outgoing Socialistgovernment had targeted. Matolcsy reiterated in the interview that the new governmentwanted to cut the bloated public sector in the next four years,but said firing a large number of state employees in its firstyear would make no sense. "Sacking people in the crisis would be a very stupid thing;in that moment consumption and the revenue of the (state) budgetwould fall," he said. He said the government did not have an exchange rate target,but the economy needed a stable forint . The currencytraded around 273 against the euro on Thursday. "Movements of a few percent in the exchange rate can beallowed, but 15-20-30 forint jumps not," he said. He reiterated a call for the central bank's rate settingMonetary Council to resign because the bank hadcommitted policy mistakes in recent years. [ID:nLDE64A0D5] "I will cooperate with the central bank's governor, theMonetary Council, but in a professional respect I think it wouldbe better... if they quit," he said. The heads of financial markets regulator PSZAF and taxauthority APEH should also stand down, he said. (Reporting by Sandor Peto; editing by John Stonestreet)             ]]></raw>
