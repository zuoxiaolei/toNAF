<raw><![CDATA[   * China allows yuan to rise 0.4% to post-devaluation high * Euro, Aussie hit 1-mth highs as dollar falls broadly   * Euro recovery fragile, investors look to sell rallies (Recasts, updates prices, adds quotes) NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - The Australian and NewZealand dollars rose to their highest levels in about a monthon Monday after China let the yuan rise to a five-year high,raising optimism about global economic recovery.China's vow to allow a flexible yuan is expected to boostits buying power abroad. Given China's huge demand for rawmaterials, the move was seen spurring a rise in demand forcommodities and gave a boost to commodity-linked currenciessuch as the Australian dollar. Spot yuan rose to its highest level since its revaluationfive years ago, bolstering hopes the flexibility pledge fromChina over the weekend would begin to reduce global imbalancesand ease tensions in the Group of 20 leading economies ahead ofa meeting next week. The single European currency initially extended last week'srecovery against the dollar, at one point rising to a one-monthhigh, though gains faded as the New York session got underway. The dollar slipped versus a basket of currencies to aone-month low largely because of the euro's rise. "Until we know more from China, how much (they will allowthe yuan to appreciate) and in what time frame, we probablywon't be seeing much reaction in the major crosses," said DanCook, senior market analyst at IG Markets in Chicago. This isdefinitely ahead of the G20 to get them off the hook." Midway through the New York session, the higher-yieldingAustralian dollar gained 1 percent to $0.8807, off an earlierone-month peak. The New Zealand dollar rose 0.8 percent to$0.7117, after an earlier five-week high. A higher yuan would help temper inflation in China bypushing down import prices, which in turn could mean Beijingwould have less need to tighten monetary policy aggressively. Markets have been worried China could over-tighten and slowits economy too far which had raised concerns about Beijing'sdemand for natural resources, which would impact currencieswhich are part of the commodity bloc. But some analysts were cautioning how long the latest newsfrom China will impact markets. "China has an incentive to frontload moves before the G20meeting and the U.S. currency report, so we could see acontinuation of these moves through most of this week andpossibly into next," said Steven Englander, Citigroup's globalhead of currency strategy. "But the incentives for China tomake currency moves after the currency report is releaseddiminishes." Wells Fargo is forecasting a 4-1/2 percent gain in the yuanover the next year, compared to the 2-1/2 percent risecurrently priced into the non-deliverable forwardmarketsession. It was last down 0.1 percent at $1.2374 afterearlier having rallied to its highest level since May 24 ontrading platform EBS. European Central Bank governing council member ChristianNoyer said on Monday some banks were facing funding problems,as banks continue to deposit cash at the ECB as a result ofcurrent market uncertainty.. Traders said option barriers at $1.2500 were reportedlybeing protected by a major Asian sovereign account, which hadprevented further gains overnight. The euro rose against the low-yielding yen, gaining 0.4percent to 112.82 yen. The dollar was up 0.5 percent versus theyen at 91.16 yen. The euro closed on Friday with its best weekly gain sinceMay 2009 after a successful Spanish bond auction eased concernsover the health of Spain's public finances. The euro's recovery, however, is still uncertain. "The euro main focus is still the sovereign debt," said IGMarkets' Cook. "There are a lot of questions about the euro ingeneral and as long as it remains quiet, it will remain atthese levels." (Reporting by Nick Olivari; Editing by Andrew Hay)             ]]></raw>
