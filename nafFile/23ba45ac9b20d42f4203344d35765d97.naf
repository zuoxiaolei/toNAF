<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar was higher against the euro on Thursday as concerns over political deadlock in Italy hit demand for the single currency, while the yen edged lower against the greenback.During U.S. morning trade, the dollar rose to session highs against the euro, with EUR/USD falling 0.39% to 1.3084.Concerns that a political deadlock in Italy could destabilize sovereign debt markets in the euro zone eased after an auction of Italian bonds on Wednesday went smoothly.But the euro remained under pressure amid fears that Italy would not be able to continue to implement structural reforms and austerity measures following inconclusive election results.In the U.S., official data showed that fourth quarter GDP was revised up to 0.1% from an initial estimate for a 0.1% contraction, but came in below expectations for 0.5% growth.Separately, the Department of Labor said jobless claims dropped 22,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 344,000, compared to expectations for a decline of 6,000 to 360,000.The dollar pushed higher against the yen, with USD/JPY rising 0.15% to 92.36.The yen was little changed earlier after Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe nominated Asian Development Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda to be the next governor of the Bank of Japan.Mr. Kuroda, a proponent of aggressive monetary easing, will replace current BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, whose policies Prime Minister Abe has criticized for not doing enough to combat deflation.The greenback was lower against the pound, with GBP/USD rising 0.20% to 1.5186, but gained ground against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF climbing 0.41% to 0.9335.In Switzerland, official data showed that the economy expanded by 0.2% in the fourth quarter, defying expectations for a contraction of 0.3%.The greenback was mixed against its Canadian, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, with USD/CAD climbing 0.51% to 1.0283, AUD/USD inching up 0.04% to 1.0237 and NZD/USD edging up 0.08% to 0.8283.In Canada, official data showed that the raw material price index rose 3.8% in January, erasing the previous months 2.0% decline, while the industrial product price index remained flat.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose 0.33% to 81.88.Earlier Thursday, official data showed that the number of people unemployed in Germany fell by 3,000 to 2.9 million in February, slightly below expectations for a decline of 5,000, while the unemployment rate held steady at 6.9%. Elsewhere, revised data showed that Spain’s economy contracted by 0.8% in the fourth quarter, from an initial estimate for a 0.7% contraction, bringing the annual rate of contraction to 1.9%.A separate report showed that consumer inflation in the euro zone held steady at 2.0% in January, in line with initial estimates.             ]]></raw>
