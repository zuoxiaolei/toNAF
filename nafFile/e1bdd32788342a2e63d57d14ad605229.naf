<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The U.S. dollar advanced to a daily high against the yen on Monday, after Moody's Investors Service said the trend for credit ratings in the Asia-Pacific region was stable except for Japan. USD/JPY hit 81.06 during early European trade, the daily high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 80.97, gaining 0.23%.The pair was likely to find support at 80.14, the low of May 10 and short-term resistance at 81.32, the high of May 11.Moody’s said it may cut the ratings on Tokyo Electric Power Company’s creditor banks if they forgive loans to the power utility. Last week Japan's top government spokesman suggested that banks may be asked to forgive loans to help Tepco cope with massive compensation claims arising from the crisis at its stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.Earlier in the day, the yen was briefly boosted by a stronger-than-expected reading in Japan's machinery orders data for March, but it quickly lost gains as the data is known to be highly volatile and gave little insight on the impact of the March 11 quake.The yen was also lower against the euro, with EUR/JPY rising 0.28% to hit 114.38.Later Monday, the U.S. was to publish official data on manufacturing activity in New York state, while Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was to speak.             ]]></raw>
