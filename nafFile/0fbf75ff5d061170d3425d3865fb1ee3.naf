<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro retreats further after hitting resistance near $1.23 * Moody's downgrade of Greece used as excuse to sell * Aussie off 1-mth highs, RBA minutes back steady rate view By Satomi Noguchi TOKYO, June 15 (Reuters) - The euro's rally showed signs offading on Tuesday, with investors taking profits and sentimenttowards the single currency staying fragile as debt worriesreturned after Moody's cut Greece's credit rating to junk grade. The Australian dollar pulled back further from a one-monthhigh versus the U.S. dollar as traders reduced demand forhigher-yielding currencies after minutes of an Australian centralbank meeting confirmed the market view that interest rates willbe on hold at least for the next month. Traders said with the euro failing to break near termresistance at around $1.23, the single currency's impressive runin the past few sessions was showing signs of fizzling. "The euro would need more than short-covering to movedecisively up from here," said a senior trader at a Japanesesecurities house, adding that the market looked still vulnerableto euro-negative news given shaky equity markets. The euro was at $1.2204, down 0.1 percent from late New Yorktrade on Monday, retreating further from the previous day's highof $1.2298 on trading platform EBS. Traders said Moody's downgrade was being used by investors asan excuse to pare positions in the single currency. Moody's cutGreece's credit rating to junk status and said the country facedsubstantial risks.. The Moody's downgrade could still have an effect in thebackground, but an overall revival in risk appetite may checksharp losses, traders said. While resistance is still around the first Fibonacciretracement level at $1.2301, the 23.6 percent of the currency'smove from an April 14 high to its June 7 low, support is seen ataround $1.2165 on hourly charts. The euro fell as far as $1.1876 on June 7, its lowest sinceMarch 2006. "Whether the bounce in the euro from $1.19 to $1.22 is morethan a brief relief bounce remains open for debate but the sharpreaction to the rating downgrade overnight suggests thatsentiment is still extremely fragile," Matthew Strauss, seniorcurrency strategist at RBC Capital wrote in a note. The euro fell 0.2 percent on the yen to 111.68 yen. The U.S.dollar edged down to 91.50 yen as sell orders from Japaneseexporters were seen capping its gains. The Bank of Japan's policy decision expected around 12:30-2p.m. (0330-0500 GMT) and Governor Masaaki Shirakawa's embargoedpress conference from 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) are the key events onthe Asian calendar on Tuesday.. The BOJ is expected to announce details of a new lendingscheme, but that is unlikely to move the yen, traders said. The minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's June policymeeting said it was able to leave interest rates unchanged in thenear term as previous rate hikes gave it time to see how Europe'sdebt woes would affect the world economy and to wait for moreinformation on domestic inflation. Board members also said disinflationary forces in thedomestic economy had not been as strong as expected andhighlighted the importance of coming data on consumer prices, duein late July, reinforcing expectations for steady interest ratesat its next policy-setting meeting in early July. The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent to $0.8554, extendingits pullback from a one-month high of $0.8665 the previous daywhen an overall improvement in risk appetite supported demand forhigher-yielding currencies.
