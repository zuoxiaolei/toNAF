<raw><![CDATA[   * Euro pares losses though sentiment still shaky* Aussie falls as RBA surprises by holding rates* Analysts say Aussie may have further room to fall* Market eyes White House adviser Volcker's testimony (Adds quotes, updates prices) By Neal Armstrong LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on Tuesdayas Greek government bond spreads over German benchmarksnarrowed, though sentiment remained shaky ahead of the EuropeanCommission's opinion due mid-week on Greece's fiscal plan. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou told a economicconference the level of Greek bond spreads over euro zonebenchmarks was completely unjustified, keeping up the rhetoricagainst speculators he blames for targeting his country.    "Sentiment remains fragile despite the strong U.S. GDP datalast week and the Greek situation is still in the background,making investors cautious," said Paul Robson, currencystrategist at RBS.  At 1051 GMT, the euro had pared earlier losses to trade up0.1 percent on the day at $1.3938. It hit a seven-month lowagainst the dollar on Monday. Greek 10-year yield spreads over Bunds tightened to theirnarrowest since Jan.27 before widening back out to 344 bps.

European Central Bank Governing Council member VitorConstancio said on Tuesday Portugal needs to carry out"significant adjustments" in its economy, adding that he wasrelatively pessimistic about the short-term outlook.  AUSSIE DOWN The Australian dollar remained pressured after Australia'scentral bank kept interest rates on hold, contrary to marketexpectations for a rate rise, sparking a sell-off in risk tradesand a bid for lower-yielding currencies such as the yen and theU.S. dollar. However, the RBA left the door open for further rate risesshould the domestic economy continue to improve as expected. The Aussie steadied to trade at $0.8800 against the U.S.dollar, although it was still down 1.3 percent on the day. Against the yen, it also shed around 1.4 percent, as carrytrades came under pressure. "The Australian dollar sold off as investors reconsideredtheir long positions versus the U.S. dollar, the yen and the NewZealand dollar in particular," said Lauren Rosborough, acurrency strategist at Westpac. "There may be more room on the downside, with the DecemberAussie/dollar low at $0.8735 now a key level to watch."  Risk sentiment will be under scrutiny later when White Houseadviser Paul Volcker appears before the Senate Banking Committeeto defend the administration's proposal to limit risk-trading bybanks, which spooked investors and triggered a sell-off inequities when it was unveiled last month.  According to testimony obtained by Reuters, Volcker willurge Congress to curb the risks taken by large banks to helpprevent them from being treated as "too big to fail"."The market will be hoping Volker doesn't sound tooaggressive on the banking and financial system, as this wouldfurther undermine risk and take equity markets lower," saidRBS's Robson. The yen pared earlier gains versus the euro to trade down0.3 percent on the day around 126.55 yen, though the Japanesecurrency remained in favour against the Australian dollar,trading up roughly 1 percent at 79.90 yen. The dollar was trading down slightly versus a basket ofcurrencies at 79.20, though still close to its recent six-monthhighs of 79.534. (Editing by Nigel Stephenson)             ]]></raw>
