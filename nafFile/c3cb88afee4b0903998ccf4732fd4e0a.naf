<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro down 0.5 percent vs dollar at $1.3675 * Single currency hit by reported Greek comments * Risk demand dwindles, high-risk FX edge lower (Adds comment, details, updates prices) By Neal Armstrong LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Thursday aftera media report saying Greece is not hopeful of receiving aidfrom euro zone members added to uncertainty over a resolution toits debt problems and soured sentiment for the single currency . An unidentified Greek official quoted in the report saidGreece was increasingly pessimistic about the prospect of helpat a March 25 European Union summit and may seek InternationalMonetary Fund aid during the April 2-4 Easter weekend. Greece, battling to deal with crippling debts, has said itis counting on EU leaders to approve a mechanism to help thecountry at next week's meeting. But some countries -- especially Germany, the EU's biggestpaymaster -- are wary of making concrete promises, and analystssaid the Dow Jones Newswires report suggested a rift betweenGreece and Germany may be deepening. "This just highlights the uncertainty surrounding the Greeceissue. There seems to be no consensus in the euro zone, which isundermining confidence and that is what is weighing on the eurotoday," said Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank. Comments from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said onWednesday the Greek crisis had landed the euro with its biggestchallenge, were also putting selling pressure on the singlecurrency.  At 1044 GMT, the euro was down around 0.5 percent on the dayto $1.3675, pulling back from a five-week high of $1.3819 hit onelectronic trading platform EBS on Wednesday. The euro struggled as European shares retreated from a17-month closing high hit on Wednesday, while prices for oil,another risky asset, fell 0.5 percent on the day. Analysts said the latest news about Greece had cooled demandfor higher-risk assets, including currencies. "The market has been trying to chase risk all week and (theGreek comments) are a reality check," said Geoffrey Yu, currencystrategist at UBS in London. The euro hit the day's low around $1.3650 in early Europeantrade, but losses were limited due to suspected demand fromAsian central banks around that level, traders said, whiletrendline support around $1.3640 also prevented more losses. Some technical analysts said a break under that level mayopen the door to a fall to around $1.3405, the 61.8 percentFibonacci retracement of the euro's rise from its 2008 lowaround $1.23 to its highest of 2009 around $1.50.  DOLLAR GAINS The dollar rose 0.4 percent against a basket of currenciesto 79.959. The greenback slipped 0.2 percent to 90.10 yen as theJapanese currency benefited from risk aversion, pushing the euro down 0.6 percent to 123.30 yen. Versus the Canadian dollar, the U.S. dollar pulled back froma 20-month low of C$1.0071 hit on Wednesday to trade atC$1.0108, but analysts see the pair hitting parity in the nearterm on speculation that Canadian interest rates may soon rise. Analysts said escalating tensions between the United Statesand China over Beijing's yuan policy also remained on traders'radars and may provide more support to the dollar. The spat between Washington and Beijing has turnedacrimonious, with 130 U.S. lawmakers demanding sanctions unlessChina gives up what they see as an unfair competitive advantageby allowing the yuan to appreciate. Investors awaited the latest U.S. consumer inflation datalater in the day, along with initial jobless claims and thePhiladelphia Federal Reserve Business Activity survey.
