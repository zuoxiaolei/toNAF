<raw><![CDATA[ * Geithner ties "misguided" Bush policies to deficits * Political rhetoric heating up over tax cuts * All tax rates will rise in January with no action * Treasury sees $37 billion more a year from wealthy (Adds Geithner comments on alternative stimulus) By Glenn Somerville and Kim Dixon WASHINGTON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The Bush administration's"misguided" policies are to blame for huge U.S. budgetdeficits, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner charged onWednesday as he sought to build an election-year case forending tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. With congressional elections looming in November, Geithnersought to regain the high ground on the issue of who bearsresponsibility for record budget gaps and to counter Republicanlabeling of Democrats as tax-and-spend, bailout-happyliberals. Geithner said extending the Bush-era tax cuts for topincome earners, as Republicans want, would force more borrowingto cover lost revenues and crimp more-effective remedies forboosting economic growth and hiring. "Borrowing to finance tax cuts for the top 2 percent wouldbe a $700 billion fiscal mistake," Geithner said. "It's not theprescription the economy needs now, and the country can'tafford it." With the economic recovery showing signs of slowing andunemployment at a lofty 9.5 percent, President Barack Obama'spopularity has taken a heavy hit and Democrats on Capitol Hillare at risk of losing their majorities in the Senate and theHouse of Representatives. The U.S. budget gap, which hit a record $1.41 trillion infiscal 2009 and is poised to grow wider this year, has unnervedmany Americans. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll foundthat 44 percent of registered voters rank the deficit as anextremely important issue in deciding how to vote. HOT BUTTON POLITICS The debate over the tax cuts, which are scheduled to expireat the end of this year, has grown hotter in recent weeks. President Barack Obama and most Democrats want to extendthe tax cuts only for individuals making less than $200,000, orfamilies earning less than $250,000 -- about 97 percent of allAmericans. Republicans argue the recovery would be jeopardized if allthe cuts are not extended, a concern some Democrats share. "We look forward to the debate about raising taxes in themiddle of a recession," Senate Republican leader MitchMcConnell said on Tuesday. Geithner argued that better use could be made of the moneythat would otherwise flow into the government's coffers. "Ifpeople think there's a good case now for more stimulus for theeconomy, then we should have the debate about what's the bestform of stimulus," he said. Congress must take action to extend any part of the taxcuts. If the top rates expire, they would revert to 36 percentand 39.6 percent from 33 percent and 35 percent. Dividend taxrates would also rise from 15 percent to 40 percent with noaction, a key source of stress among investors.[ID:nN13219477] Another senior Treasury Department official said onWednesday that the department is assuming Congress will let thetax cuts for the wealthiest Americans expire. The Treasuryestimates doing so would reap an extra $37 billion a year andit already is setting its borrowing plans on the assumptionthat will happen. [ID:nN04235372] "FALSE PROSPERITY" Geithner, speaking to the liberal Center for AmericanProgress and the right-leaning American Action Forum, harkedback to the former Clinton administration's record of budgetsurpluses in the late 1990s, contrasting it with the succeedingBush administration that he said ran up huge debts and causedAmericans' incomes to stagnate with few jobs created. "We are living today with the damage that misguided policycaused," he said, adding that the country needed to choose anew course. "Rather than recreating a false prosperity fueledby debt and passing the bills on to the next generation, weneed to restore America to a pro-growth tax and fiscalpolicy." Geithner has spent much of the year pushing for a broadoverhaul of U.S. financial rules. With a regulatory revamp nowsigned into law, he has turned to bolstering the Obamaadministration's case for its policies. Global investors are closely monitoring U.S. efforts torein in budget deficits. The administration has said it isimportant to maintain near-term support for the economy butthat a long-term plan to get deficits under control is needed. Obama has charged a commission with coming up with a planby December 1 to bring the U.S. budget into better balance.
