<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds quotes, background) HONG KONG, Oct 30 (Reuters) - France's gross domestic product(GDP) should grow as much or more in the third quarter than itdid in the second, French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde saidduring a visit to Hong Kong on Friday. The French economy emerged from recession in the secondquarter, growing 0.3 percent, and surprising analysts. "(Third-quarter) GDP will be at least as good if not betterthan in the second quarter," Lagarde told a press conference inHong Kong at the end of a three-day trip to China. France is due to release third-quarter gross domestic productdata on Nov. 13. Lagarde also said China should decide on the valuation of itscurrency, the yuan . Many Western governments believeBeijing deliberately undervalues the currency, giving it anunfair trade advantage, and urge Beijing to allow the yuan toappreciate more rapidly. "China decides for itself (on its currency)," Lagarde said. (Reporting by Susan Fenton, writing by Doug Young; Editing byChris Lewis)             ]]></raw>
