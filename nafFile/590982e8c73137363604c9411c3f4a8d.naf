<raw><![CDATA[ * Divisions on relaxing EU competition rules for producers * Ministers to debate farming's role in EU growth strategy * Commission to report stabilisation of EU milk prices  By Charlie Dunmore BRUSSELS, March 26 (Reuters) - An ideological split overEuropean Union regulation of agricultural markets could preventfarm ministers from agreeing on measures to boost the power ofproducers in the food chain at a meeting in Brussels on Monday. EU nations that favour strong intervention by Brussels --led by France -- want to give producers more power to negotiatefavourable prices for their goods with suppliers and retailers,who they regard as having too much influence over farm prices. Options floated by the EU executive and backed by thesecountries include possible changes to EU competition rules toallow producers to jointly agree prices for their produce, orthe mandatory use of standard contracts in the food supplychain.    But opposition from a handful of more liberally-mindedcountries -- led by Britain and Sweden -- is expected to blockagreement on the plans. Thanks to the split a resolution on the issue due to beadopted on Monday will contain few concrete proposals, a draftseen by Reuters shows, and may not get the support of Britainand others. The European Commission would then have to decide whether totable legislative proposals implementing its plans despite thelack of consensus among EU governments.  JOBS AND GROWTH The role of the EU farm and food sector in boosting Europeangrowth and job creation will feature in a debate on the Europe2020 strategy. The strategy aims to define how Europe will improve itsglobal competitiveness over the next decade while tacklingclimate change. It also sets the stage for negotiations on how to allocatehundreds of billions of euros in the EU's next long-term budgetfor 2014-2021. Some governments, politicians and farm lobbies keen todefend the common agricultural policy's (CAP) current 40 percentshare of the budget have complained that farming isn't mentionedin the strategy, and hope to change that before it is finalised. EU presidency Spain has asked ministers to discuss "the needto ensure that the strategy does not interfere with or call intoquestion the funding of Union policies such as the CAP," whichcould expose rifts with countries that want to cut EU farmspending. Ministers will get a report from the Commission on thecurrent situation in the EU dairy market, following last year'scrisis in the sector. The EU executive is expected to deliver an upbeatassessment, with latest official figures showing averageproducer prices have risen to about 28 euro cents per litre,close to the long-term seasonal average. EU financial aid for dairy farmers of 300 million euros($399.6 million) agreed in October is expected to be paid out inthe coming weeks. (Editing by James Jukwey)             ]]></raw>
