<raw><![CDATA[* Greek PM wants strong EU backing to tackle speculators * Papandreou repeats no need for EU cash * Wants support in the form of a mechanism not a bailout * Says notion Greece will abandon euro laughable   (Adds details, background) By Harry Papachristou and Renee Maltezou ATHENS, March 22 (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister GeorgePapandreou said on Monday that the European Union needed strongsupport to fend off attacks by speculators on heavily indebtedmember countries. "It would be very useful if it was obvious the EU has amighty, loaded gun on the table capable of preventingspeculators and speculation, something which is beyond ourpowers, the powers of an economy our size," Papandreou said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel repeated on Monday thatthere was no need to even discuss aid for Greece because noformal request has been made for a bailout. [ID:nLDE62L257] Papandreou has stressed that the mere existence of a strongsupport mechanism would deter speculators and drive downborrowing costs. He has said he believes this would alleviateGreece's predicament sufficiently to avoid making use of it. "This is the support I asked for, not support for a bailoutbut to secure the significant period of calm and stabilitynecessary to take the big steps our country needs," he toldparliament. "We will do it under our own steam ... We have not asked formoney." He described suggestions Greece might abandon the eurocurrency as laughable. "We have now reached the point where we hear fancifulscenarios about our country exiting the euro. This isridiculous, these scenarios are laughable."(Writing by Paul Hoskins, editing by Tim Pearce)             ]]></raw>
