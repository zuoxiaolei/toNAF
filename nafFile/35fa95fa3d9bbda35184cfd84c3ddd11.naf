<raw><![CDATA[ * Greek crisis and contagion fears hit markets * Global stocks lower, emerging markets lead the way * Euro hits 14-month low against dollar before recovering  By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - World shares fell and the eurocame under renewed pressure on Thursday in what is shaping up tobe a major flight to safety by investors fearful that the Greekdebt crisis is gaining momentum. Wall Street looked set for a tentative start, despite somegains on European bourses. Emerging markets, many of which are in reasonable economicshape and relatively removed from euro zone stress, wereparticularly hard hit, with shares down 1.5 percent. MSCI's all-country world stock index was down three-quartersof a percent. Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 index fell in early trading butthen put in modest gains after strong results from BNP Paribas.It was up 0.3 percent. Japan's Nikkei tumbled more than 3 percent, catching up withother bourses after a three-day holiday. "There's no let-up in concerns that the euro zone debtcrisis could continue to worsen and as a result equity marketsacross the globe remain under pressure," said Ben Potter,analyst at IG Markets. "The bull market always had to end somewhere and it lookslike this could be the trigger." Focus was on the European Central Bank, which left interestrates unchanged but was expected later to address the crisis,which saw deadly riots in Athens on Wednesday and pressurebuilding on Spain, Portugal and others. "The ECB president will have to justify his recent decisionto accept Greek bonds indefinitely as collateral regardless oftheir credit rating," Brown Brothers Harriman said in a note.   EURO WOE The euro tumbled to a 14-month low against the dollar. European policymakers have warned the euro's survivaldepends on a life-support package for Greece agreed lastweekend. This has ratcheted up risk aversion and boostedsafe-haven demand for the dollar, pushing it to a one-year highversus a currency basket. "The driver remains concerns about the European situation,coupled with poor risk sentiment," said Kasper Kirkegaard,currency strategist at Danske in Copenhagen. The euro fell as low as $1.2717, its weakest since March2009. The common currency plumbed a one-year low against the yenof 118.85 yen on EBS, but recovered a bit to 119.7 yen. Euro zone government bond yields were mixed with demand forshort-term benchmark debt rising. (Additional reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; editing by JohnStonestreet/Toby Chopra)             ]]></raw>
