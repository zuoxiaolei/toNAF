<raw><![CDATA[ * Finmin: Icesave talks on hold, eyes deal after Dutch vote * Hopes for no more than 2.5 percent GDP contraction this yr * 2010 jobless rate "considerably less" than f'cast 10 pct * Says Icelanders more sceptical of EU membership * Says FX controls needed until at least third IMF review  By Mia Shanley STOCKHOLM, May 12 (Reuters) - Efforts by Iceland to reach avital debt accord with two European nations have stalled andtalks may not regain momentum before early June, the country'sfinance minister said on Wednesday. In a wide-ranging telephone interview, Steingrimur Sigfussonalso spoke about Iceland's financial plight and long-termprospects, suggesting the worst of its economic woes may be overwhile scepticism towards the European Union may be growing. Icelandic voters rejected a previous deal with Britain andthe Netherlands to clear some $5 billion of debts, forcing newtalks to settle a dispute which has ramifications for Iceland'srecovery and its ambition to join the EU. Since the 'Icesave' referendum in early March, littleprogress has been made, although the International Monetary Fund(IMF) and Nordic lenders have released some much-needed aid tohelp Iceland pursue economic recovery. "It has been difficult to pick up the threads after thereferendum," Sigfusson told Reuters. "Talks are on hold a bit,but we have kept in contact. The lines are open." Sigfusson, chairman of the Left-Green party, said he washopeful Iceland could land a new deal after Dutch electionsscheduled for June 9. The Left-Greens are the junior partner ina coalition with the Social Democrats. Iceland has been wrangling for months over the terms of itsrepayment plan for cash owed after its top banks collapsed under a mountain of debt in 2008. Britain and the Netherlandsreimbursed savers in their countries who lost money in Icelandicaccounts and now they want the money back from Reykjavik. The dispute -- named after high interest Icesave depositaccounts -- has made it difficult for Iceland to follow throughon a plan to gradually lift capital controls, which prop up thelocal currency but also stifle investment.  GROWING OPPOSITION The uncertainty over whether aid flows will continue meansIceland cannot depend on having a financial buffer in the eventthat any removal of controls induced an investor exodus. Sigfusson said capital controls needed to stay in place atleast until late July, when the IMF conducts a third review. "Removing capital controls is on the agenda, but this isrelated to strengthening reserves and probably the next stepswill wait until after the third review," he said. The minister was hopeful that Iceland may have already seenthe worst of its fallout. "We would hope for no more than a 2.5percent contraction this year, and mainly the drag is in thefirst half of the year," he said. The government previously forecast a 2 to 3 percentcontraction in 2010 while the IMF expects a 3 percent slide. Unemployment is hovering just above 9 percent and shouldstart coming down. Sigfusson said this year's level would be"considerably less" than a government forecast of 10 percent. Sigfusson also said opposition on the island towards EUmembership had grown, saying that the bloc's own debt problemshad fuelled scepticism. Sigfusson, whose party is known for its sceptical stancetowards the EU, said debt woes in southern Europe were makingpeople that much more skittish about joining. "Problems likeGreece are of course part of the debate in Iceland." Reykjavik may get a green light from Brussels as soon asJune or July to start formal talks accession talks, he said. Ifthe bid succeeds, Icelanders will hold a referendum on joining. Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir has said joining theEU and adopting the euro would bring stability to the economy.             ]]></raw>
