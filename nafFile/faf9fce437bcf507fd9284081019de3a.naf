<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The euro moved lower against the U.S. dollar in Asian trade Tuesday, on persistent fears over Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and the weak performances of European stock markets.EUR/USD hit 1.4099 in early Asian trade, the pair’s highest since Friday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.4068, falling 0.21%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.4056, the low of August 4, and resistance at 1.4469, last Monday’s high.A disappointing jobs report released late last week by the U.S. Labor Department showed that non-farm payrolls remained flat in August, and the unemployment rate  was unchanged at 9.1%. Market expectations were for non-farm payrolls to increase by 74,000 in August.Earlier Monday, Eurostat reported that retail sales in the euro-zone rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in July, outpacing forecasts of a 0.1% gain.Separately, market research group Sentix said Monday its index of investor confidence in the euro-zone fell 1.9 points to minus 15.5 in the month of September, down from the August reading of minus 13.5.On the index, a level above 0.0 indicates optimism, below indicates pessimism. Economists had expected the index to fall by 4.5 points to minus 18.0 in September. European stocks were off sharply in Monday trade, as the weak U.S. labor numbers added to nervousness about prospects for global economic growth.France’s CAC 40 dropped 4.73% to 2,999.54, Britain’s FTSE 100 slumped 3.58% to 5,102.58, and Germany’s DAX plummeted by 5.28% to end the session at 5,246.18.The U.S. market was closed for the Labor Day Holiday.In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union was roundly defeated in her home state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, setting the stage for a new round of debate on Germany’s role in expanding the powers of the European Financial Stability Facility.  Specific details, including the extent of member participation and a final total, have yet to be determined for the bailout fund for debt-threatened euro nations.Meanwhile, the euro was lower against the British pound and the Japanese yen, with EUR/GBP down by 0.06% to hit 0.8738, and EUR/JPY falling 0.16% to hit 108.20.Investor focus was expected to turn to the release of GDP figures for the euro-zone, as well as the U.S. Institute of Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index due for release later Tuesday.             ]]></raw>
