<raw><![CDATA[ * C.bank outlines position in draft report seen by Reuters * Market sees risk of rate rise as early as November * Could be first G20 central bank to raise rates * News comes as president to attend G20 summit this week (Adds analysts, updates markets) By Chang Tae-min and Cheon Jong-woo SEOUL, Sept 22 (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank saidit was ready to raise interest rates to help calm propertyprices, a clear signal it might soon tighten policy despiteheavy pressure from the government for caution. The comments were in a draft report to parliament obtainedby Reuters on Tuesday and the news sent December treasury bondfutures  skidding by 17 ticks and one-year interest rateswap rates  rose by almost 6 basis points. They come at a sensitive time for President Lee Myung-bak,who is in the United States to attend this week's G20 summithaving urged unity with the grouping over withdrawing theemergency measures put in place to fight the global financialcrisis. Markets see a risk that the Bank of Korea will lift ratesfrom a record low of 2.0 percent as early as November, makingit the first central bank in G20 to tighten monetary policysince the global downturn started a year ago. "We will take proper steps (against rising property prices)including monetary policy if necessary, taking a look atconditions of financial markets and the economy in the future,"the Bank of Korea said in the report. House prices in South Korea have been rising for fivestraight months and stand just below year-earlier levels,defying government efforts so far to temper the increase. That touches on an intensifying global debate aboutfocusing monetary policy on pricking asset bubbles, a shiftaway from the conventional goal of focusing it to control broadinflation. President Lee and his finance minister have repeatedlyargued that the economic recovery is too fragile to risktighter policies now and they want to be sure the privatesector is investing and creating jobs before removing thissupport. The central bank report, written in September but undated,predicted mortgage lending would increase further onexpectations of a rise in property prices. On Saturday, a local newspaper had reported that the Bankof Korea had told lawmakers it may have to raise interest ratesto put the brakes on a property boom and borrowing frenzy. "Many investors expect a higher rate within this year asthe Bank of Korea appears to be using anything as an excuse toraise rates," said Kong Dong-rak, a fixed-income analyst atTaurus Investment & Securities. "The government will keep warning against a higher rate.But if the Bank of Korea does not raise interest rates inNovember or the BOK does not make hawkish comments, that willlead to doubts over its stance on tightening policy itself," headded. Analysts expect the central bank to wait for more economicdata, including third quarter GDP due late in October, and seethe impact of recent steps to slow the property markets beforeraising rates. "It would be hard to ignore concerns over the impact on theeconomy and the country needs to cooperate with othercountries," said Park Sang-hyun, chief economist at HIInvestment & Securities. Domestic money market rates have been rising in recentweeks as a series of upbeat economic indicators promptedinvestor bets on a rate hike. The central bank is independent by law, so can ignoregovernment pressure in theory. However, it is also obliged toimplement policy in harmony with the government. Analysts say the president is keen for the central bank totoe the line partly because South Korea will host the G20summit in 2010, an opportunity to boost its image as a leadingemerging economy. G20 finance ministers said at a meeting earlier this monththat stimulus should stay in place. [ID:nL5327479] But, analysts also argue, Bank of Korea Governor LeeSeong-tae can resist government pressure since his term ends inMarch. The economy has experienced a sharp turnaround in fortunessince the crisis hit the exporter with full force earlier thisyear and most analysts have raised their expectations for theeconomy sharply from a deep contraction to a more shallow one. Reflecting these improving prospects, the Asian DevelopmentBank (ADB) on Tuesday upgraded its 2009 GDP forecast for SouthKorea to a fall of 2.0 percent from a previous fall of 3.0percent. It sees 4 percent growth in 2010. [ID:nSP464566] Most analysts predict the Bank of Korea will start raisingthe benchmark 7-day repurchase agreement rate early next year, but chances are growing it will be earlier. The Bank of Korea cut the rate by 3.25 percentage pointsbetween last October and February this year and has since heldit steady. It reviews policy on Oct. 9.
