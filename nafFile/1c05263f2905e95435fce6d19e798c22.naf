<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro remained moderately higher in light trade on Friday, as recent comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke continued to weigh on demand for the greenback.   EUR/USD hit 1.3151 during U.S. morning trade, the pair's highest since July 17; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3121, easing up 0.08%.   The pair was likely to find support at 1.3052, the low of July 16 and resistance at 1.3026, the high of July 10.  In his second day of testimony on monetary policy before the Financial Services Committee in Congress, Bernanke reiterated that monetary policy will remain highly accommodative, even as the central bank starts to pare back its bond buying.  On Wednesday, Bernanke said the central bank expects to start tapering bond purchases by the end of the year, but added that there was no “preset course.”He added that the bank’s bond purchase program could be tapered at a faster pace, slower pace or even temporarily increased depending on economic and financial developments.   Earlier in the day, official data showed that producer price inflation in German was flat in June, confounding expectations for a 0.1% downtick, after a 0.3% decline the previous month.   A separate report showed that house prices in Spain fell by 2.4% in the second quarter, following a 0.8% decline in the first quarter.   Markets were also jittery as finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 Nations were gathering in Moscow to dicuss market volatility, unemployment and a slow economic recovery.   The euro was lower against the pound with EUR/GBP slipping 0.12%, to hit 0.8560.   Also Friday, official data showed that public sector net borrowing in the U.K. fell less-than-expected in June, declining to GBP10.2 billion from GBP12.8 billion the previous month.   Analysts had expected public sector net borrowing to fall to GBP9.5 billion last month.   Trading volumes were expected to remain light on Friday, as no U.S. data was scheduled to be released throughout the day.             ]]></raw>
