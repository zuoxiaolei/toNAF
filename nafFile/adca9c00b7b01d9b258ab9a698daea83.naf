It wasquoted at $0.8780, up from $0.8727 on Monday. A rise would make Australia the first G20 nation to raiserates since the crisis worsened with Lehman's collapse lastyear. Analysts said the Aussie, up 24 percent against the dollarthis year, was likely to remain relatively firm even if theReserve Bank of Australia keeps rates unchanged. "The Aussie may dip slightly against the dollar if the RBAholds rates, as an immediate reaction. But it will keep itsfirm trend," said Hideki Hayashi, global economist at MizuhoSecurities in Tokyo. Australian shares trimmed early gains ahead of the ratedecision, but investor sentiment across the region was boostedby data showing the U.S. service sector expanded last month forthe first time in a year [ID:nN05400003].

WON INTERVENTION The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks traded outside Japan and the Thomson Reuters index of regionalshares  were both up 1 percent. China's markets are closed until Friday for publicholidays. Japanese shares were more subdued, with the Nikkei index flat, as the yen's recent strength has raised concernabout exporters' earnings.
