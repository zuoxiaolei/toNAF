<raw><![CDATA[The aussie hit a 5-week low against the U.S. dollar on Monday, as investors unwound yen-funded carry trades after a British regulator reportedly said such trades were "economically valueless."  During late morning European trading, the Australian dollar shed 0.3% against its U.S. counterpart to hit 0.8810, the pair's lowest rate since Dec. 24. AUD/USD was likely to find support at 0.8733, the low of Dec. 23, and resistance at 0.8872, the daily high.  Earlier Monday, the head of Britain's Financial Services Authority was quoted by the Times newspaper as saying he would like to restrain carry trades, in which investors borrow at low rates in one currency, such as the dollar or yen, to buy a higher-yielding currency, such as the aussie.             ]]></raw>
