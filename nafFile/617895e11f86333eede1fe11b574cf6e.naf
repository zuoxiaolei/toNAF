Economists had expected the index to drop to 43.5.Meanwhile, the single European currency also rose against the yen, with EUR/JPY climbing 0.49% to hit 124.42.Later Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee was expected to reiterate its vow to keep interest rates very low for an "extended period."Earlier in the day, U.S. Census Bureau data showed there was a smaller-than-expected decline in the number of building permits issued and housing starts in the U.S. during February.             ]]></raw>
