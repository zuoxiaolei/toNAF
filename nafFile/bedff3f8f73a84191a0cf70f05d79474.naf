<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro remained slightly higher against the U.S. dollar in light trade on Tuesday, after the release of mixed U.S. economic reports, while the recent announcement of a bailout deal for Cyprus continued to support the single currency.   EUR/USD hit 1.2890 during U.S. morning trade, the session high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2869, adding 0.13%.   The pair was likely to find support at 1.2737, the low of November 21 and resistance at 1.2978, the high of March 20.   The single currency remained supported after euro zone finance ministers on Monday rubber stamped a EUR10 billion international bailout for Cyprus that will see the closure of the countryâ€™s second largest lender Laiki Bank and inflict heavy losses deposits of more than EUR100,000.  Investors remained cautious however after Eurogroup head, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said that the rescue program agreed for Cyprus represents a new model for resolving euro zone banking problems and other countries may have to restructure their banking sectors.  He later appeared to backtrack, saying Cyprus was a specific case with exceptional challenges.   In the U.S., the Conference Board said its index of consumer sentiment fell unexpectedly in March, sliding down to 59.7 from a reading of 68.0 the previous month. Analysts had expected the index to remain unchanged this month.   A separate report showed that new home sales in the U.S. rose 411,000 in February, disappointing expectations for a 422,000 increase, after a 431,000 rise the previous month.   The Standard & Poor's/Case Shiller composite 20 house price index rose to an annualized rate of 8.1% in January, from 6.8% the previous month, beating expectations for a rise to 7.9%.   In addition, the Census Bureau said that U.S. core durable goods orders fell 0.5% in February, disappointing expectations for a 0.5% rise, after a 2.9% increase the previous month.   However, durable goods orders, including transportation items, rose 5.7% last month, more than the expected 3.8% increase, following a 3.8% decline in January.   The euro was higher against the pound with EUR/GBP rising 0.22%, to hit 0.8486.   Also Tuesday, the Confederation of British Industry said earlier that its index of realized sales fell unexpectedly to zero in March, from a reading of 8 the previous month. Analysts had expected the index to rise to 12 this month.             ]]></raw>
