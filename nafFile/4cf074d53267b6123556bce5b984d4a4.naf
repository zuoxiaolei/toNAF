<raw><![CDATA[ LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The euro zone has not yetconvinced investors its debt position is sustainable and furthercontagion could harm global economic recovery, a senior IMFofficial was quoted as saying. In an interview with Bloomberg news agency late on Thursday,Naoyuki Shinohara, deputy managing director of the InternationalMonetary Fund, said the premium investors demand to hold Greekand Irish bonds remained "very high" despite their bailouts. "That means that scepticism over the sustainability of theirdebt in the market hasn't been cleared away," he was quoted assaying. "At least for now it looks like the spillover from theEuropean sovereign crisis to areas outside of the region will belimited," Shinohara said. "However, if the European sovereigndebt problems were to become bigger, we need to keep in mindthat that could bring about considerable downside risks." Heavily-indebted Spain and Portugal staged successful bondissues this week, easing some concerns about an escalation ofeuro zone debt strife and buying the bloc's leaders more time tocome up with a new package of anti-crisis measures, whichanalysts say is both essential and urgent. Following rescues of Greece and Ireland last year, Portugaland Spain are seen as the euro zone countries most at risk ofneeding a bailout and weak demand for their bonds would haveaggravated jitters and raised pressure on European leaders toact fast.
