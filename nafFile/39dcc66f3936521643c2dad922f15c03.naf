<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was sharply lower against the Swiss franc on Friday as uncertainty over the future direction of U.S. monetary policy sparked increased safe haven demand.USD/CHF hit session lows of 0.9592, the pair’s lowest since May 16 before settling at 0.9610, 0.79% lower for the day and down 1.11% for the week.The pair is likely to find support at 0.9520, the low of May 14 and resistance at 0.9716, Friday’s high.On Wednesday Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said a decision to scale back the U.S. central bank’s USD85 billion-dollar-a-month asset purchase program could be taken in the "next few meetings" depending on economic data.The comments came during testimony on the economy and monetary policy to the U.S. Joint Economic Committee in Washington.Earlier Wednesday, Bernanke said in prepared remarks that a premature tightening of monetary policy carried substantial risks to the economic recovery.Meanwhile, Wednesday’s minutes from the Fed’s May meeting showed a "number" of policymakers were prepared to taper bonds purchases as soon as June.The dollar extended losses against the Swissy on Friday after official data showed that U.S. durable goods orders rose 3.3% in April, outstripping expectations for a 1.5% increase.Elsewhere, the euro was sharply lower against the Swissy on Friday, with EUR/CHF dropping 0.78% to close at 1.2425.The euro rose to two year highs against the Swiss franc on Wednesday after Swiss National Bank Chairman Thomas Jordan said the bank is open to shifting the cap on the euro and negative interest rates.The cap on the euro was put in place by the SNB in September 2011 to control the rapid appreciation of the franc as the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone intensified.In the week ahead, volumes look likely to remain thin on Monday, with public holidays in the U.K. and the U.S. Investors will be looking ahead to data on gross domestic product from Switzerland, while the U.S. is to release data on the housing sector, consumer confidence and initial jobless claims.Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.
