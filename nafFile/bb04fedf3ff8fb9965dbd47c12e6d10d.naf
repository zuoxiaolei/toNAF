<raw><![CDATA[ * Swiss Actelion posts "stellar" results, ups forecast * Ireland's Elan also beats expectations * Elan gives J&J option to buy Biogen MS drug stake * US biotechs Gilead, Genzyme, Celgene also report this week * Actelion shares up 1.2 percent; Elan up 0.1 percent (Adds more comment; updates shares) By Sam Cage and Padraic Halpin ZURICH/DUBLIN, July 21 (Reuters) - European drugmakersActelion and Elan both beat profit forecasts on Tuesday, assales of key medicines helped shield them from the recession. The strong results from Actelion, Europe's largest biotechcompany, and Irish drugmaker Elan set the stage for results fromU.S. biotechs Gilead, Genzyme and Celgene. Actelion raised its full-year outlook after itssecond-quarter profit beat expectations, helped by strong salesof key drug Tracleer -- results which Vontobel analyst AndrewWeiss described as "stellar". Elan, also beat expectations, aided by a jump in sales ofmultiple sclerosis drug Tysabri, even though it posted a widernet loss. The Irish company, which this month sold an 18.4 percentstake to U.S. healthcare group Johnson & Johnson, also confirmedit has given J&J an option to acquire Biogen Idec Inc's 50percent stake in the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri, shouldthere be a change of control at Biogen.  Actelion is trying to cut its dependence on Tracleer for  pulmonary arterial hypertension, which rakes in more than $1billion a year, by developing it for new indications and pushingother new drugs to market. However, it reported some delays in its promising portfolioof new medicines -- a key driver for biotech groups -- includingsleep drug almorexant, which is being developed with Britain'sGlaxoSmithKline. Actelion Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel said the group wasin talks with U.S. regulators over labelling for almorexant, apotential billion-dollar seller, which would mean a delay ofeight to nine months. Actelion shares were up 1.2 percent to 58.2 Swiss francs by1347 GMT, versus a 1 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx Europeanhealth care index. Elan shares, which jumped 9 percent on Mondayfollowing media reports that it may invest in a biologicsoperation in Ireland, were up 0.1 percent to 5.685 euros. "Despite the strong financial results, we are disappointedto learn that the pipeline has experienced several delays," saidOlav Zilian, an analyst at brokerage Helvea.  MS BOOST FOR ELAN Elan's results were driven by a 30 percent jump in sales ofits multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri, which the company saidabout 43,300 patients worldwide were taking by the end of June. Elan and partner Biogen Idec originally predicted 100,000patients would be taking Tysabri by the end of 2010. While theystill expect to reach that figure, which would mean the drugcould bring in $2 billion to $3 billion a year, they do notexpect to reach it within that timeframe. Jack Gorman, an analyst at Davy Stockbrokers, said thatgiving away the right on the potential blockbuster drug Tysabri,may actually be a good move for Elan. "Looking at it another way, such a provision may indicatethat J&J has more than a passing interest in the Tysabri asset-- if it was ultimately to become Elan's partner in MS, we wouldview this as a good result," Gorman said in a note.
