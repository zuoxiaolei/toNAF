<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen on Monday, as market sentiment broadly improved on news that the European Union agreed to a Spanish bailout in order to assist the country’s troubled banking sector.USD/JPY hit 79.72 during early European trade, the daily high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 79.59, adding 0.16%.The pair was likely to find support at 79.09, the low of May 21 and resistance at 80.06, the high of May 23.On Saturday, Spain’s Finance Minister Luis de Guindos said the EU will grant Spain a loan of up to EUR100 billion that the government will use to recapitalize the country’s ailing banking sector.Finance ministers from the euro zone welcomed the move, saying the sum "must cover estimated capital requirements with an additional safety margin."Investors remained cautious however, as they looked forward to a Greek national election on June 17 that could put Athens on a path out of the euro zone and precipitate a deeper crisis over the future of the shared currency.Markets shrugged off official data showing that Chinese inflation, industrial output and retail sales disappointed expectations in May, after unexpectedly strong import data eased concerns over a ‘hard landing’ in the world’s second largest economy.In Japan, government data showed earlier that an index of manufacturing activity improved less-than-expected in the second quarter, rising to minus 5.7 from a reading of minus 7.3 the previous quarter.Analysts had expected the index to improve to minus 2.4 in the second quarter.Meanwhile, the yen was sharply lower against the euro with EUR/JPY jumping 1.10%, to hit 100.55.Later in the day, France was to publish official data on industrial production, while Italy was to announce the details of an auction of government bonds.             ]]></raw>
