<raw><![CDATA[   * 888, Ladbrokes say talks at early stage * Ladbrokes, 888 decline comment on level of approach * Possible U.S. prosecution of 888 may block deal -analysts * Sunday Telegraph reported offer at 70 pence/share * Shares in 888 rise as much as 24 percent  By Matt Scuffham LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Online gambling firm 888confirmed it was in talks with Ladbrokes over a possibletakeover by Britain's biggest bookmaker, sending its sharessoaring by as much as 24 percent on Monday. Shares in 888, which had lost around two-thirds of theirvalue since January, were up 18 percent at 58 pence at 1020 GMT,having been as high as 60.75 pence. The Sunday Telegraph reported Ladbrokes, which has 2,700betting shops, was lining up a 70 pence-a-share bid, valuing 888at around 240 million pounds, at a premium of some 40 percent to888's closing price on Friday. Spokesmen for Ladbrokes and 888 declined to comment on thelevel of the approach and stressed talks were at an early stage. The two held talks four years ago but these were abortedbecause of Ladbrokes' concerns over the threat of possibleretrospective legal action in relation to 888's activities inthe United States prior to the industry being outlawed in 2006. Unlike rivals PartyGaming and Sportingbet, 888 has yet tostrike a deal with U.S. authorities to give it immunity fromprosecution. "This may be a barrier to a bid," said LiberumCapital analyst Richard Taylor. Collins Stewart analyst Simon Davies said a price of 70pence a share would be well received by 888 shareholders but also expressed concern over the spectre of U.S. litigation. "We believe a 70-pence offer should be a slam dunk for (888)investors, but see significant regulatory risk to a successfultransaction given that 888 has not procured a non-prosecutionagreement with the US Department of Justice, which represents apotential poison pill." The merger of PartyGaming and bwin, announced in August, hadbeen expected to kick-off a wave of consolidation across anindustry seen by analysts as fragmented, though 888 was expectedto need a settlement with U.S. authorities before emerging as acredible candidate. A deal would represent the first corporate activity by Ladbrokes Chief Executive Richard Glynn, who joined in April. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said a deal would be a strategicand financial winner, matching Ladbrokes' strong sports bettingbook with 888's casino offering to create a combined onlinegambling business with annual revenue of around 350 millionpounds and earnings of 85 million. Morgan Stanley said there was potential for the companies tosave 25 million pounds a year in technology, marketing andoverhead costs. That would make the deal around 10 percentearnings enhancing by 2012. In August, 888 scrapped its dividend, preferring to preservecash after a weak economy and competition from the soccer WorldCup sapped appetite for poker games and hit its first-halfprofit. Shares in Ladbrokes were down 0.3 percent to 127.1 pence.  ($1=.6400 pound)  (Editing by Jon Loades-Carter and David Hulmes)             ]]></raw>
