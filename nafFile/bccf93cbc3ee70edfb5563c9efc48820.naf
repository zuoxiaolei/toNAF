<raw><![CDATA[ * China eyes targeted energy-efficiency, anti-pollution steps * Beijing would buy more from U.S. if allowed, planner says * China confident of keeping rise in CPI below 3 pct in 2010 TIANJIN, China, Sept 14 (Reuters) - China will introducestricter rules to reduce industrial pollution and increase energyefficiency, which will remain core objectives over the next fiveyears, a senior economic planning official said on Tuesday. Zhang Xiaoqiang, a vice-chairman of the National Developmentand Reform Commission, said the drive against sectors thatconsume a lot of energy and spew out pollution would be targeted. "We need to avoid one-size-fits-all regulations," he toldreporters on the sidelines of a meeting of the World EconomicForum in this northern port city. Zhang was speaking as the ruling Communist Party completesthe draft of China's five-year plan, its twelfth, covering theperiod 2011-2016. Cutting the amount of energy needed to produce each unit ofGDP by 20 percent was a cornerstone of the current 2005-2010plan. Behind on its target, the government has ordered the closureof 2,087 outdated, energy-inefficient plants by the end of thismonth to try to hit the goal. "We will continue to impose quotas for eliminating obsoletecapacity and emission reductions during the 12th five-year planperiod," Zhang said. He said China was willing to import more from the UnitedStates, but chided Washington for curbing the export of certainsensitive goods. "China does not seek a trade surplus, and we are willing toactively increase imports from the U.S. But it is the U.S. thathas set too many restrictions on exports to China," Zhang said. Political tempers are fraying in Washington over the largeU.S. bilateral trade deficit with China. Lawmakers will grill U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithneron the issue this week, with some pressing for punitive actionagainst Beijing unless it lets the yuan rise more swiftly. Turning to domestic inflation, Zhang expressed confidencethat full-year inflation would be below the government's targetceiling of 3 percent. Consumer prices rose 3.5 percent in the year to August. Inthe first eight months, prices were up 2.8 percent from a yearearlier. "The chances are not great that international commodityprices will push up domestic consumer prices in the coming threeto four months," Zhang said.
