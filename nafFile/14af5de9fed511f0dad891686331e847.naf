Better than expected U.S. monthly employment data alsoprovided some Wall Street stocks with some support in a heavilytraded session a day after indexes posted their worst losses intwo years. The MSCI's All-Country World Index fell 1.3 percent on the day. The Dow Jones industrial average eked out a small gain,rising 0.5 percent. Composite trading volume was the highestsince the day after the U.S. "flash crash" in May 2010, whenU.S. equity markets plummeted 9 percent in a single day. World leaders moved to address the financial marketvolatility which has been driven by fears the global economy isslipping back into recession and by the inability ofpolicymakers in Europe to extinguish the debt crisis engulfingthe region. Italy, under pressure to help halt the market rout that isendangering the global economy, pledged to speed up austeritymeasures and social reforms in return for European Central Bankhelp with funding. "That was the real thing that got us started (off thelows)," said Rick Klingman, managing director of Treasurytrading at BNP Paribas in New York. That "may clear the way forthe ECB to start buying some Italian bonds."  Graphic on week's losses - http://link.reuters.com/xus92s^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ALL EYES ON EUROPE Apart from signs that the U.S. and global economies areweakening, despite record low interest rates and the pumping ofliquidity into the system, the focus was clearly on Europe thisweek, where bond yields in Spain and Italy have been rising,threatening the same kind of refinancing problems that havealready hit Greece, Ireland and Portugal. The European Central Bank disappointed investors onThursday by buying Irish and Portuguese bonds but not Italianor Spanish debt but by Friday appeared to be getting closer toaction. Sources told Reuters the ECB is willing to support theItalian bond market if the government carries out reforms.[ID:nL3E7J5149]. "The apparent quid-pro-quo between the ECB and Italy forthe latter to bring forward austerity and structural reform inreturn for ECB Italian bond purchases, is the most desirableoutcome for the markets available," said Alan Ruskin, globalhead of G10 currency strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York. European stocks  posted their biggest weeklydecline in nearly three years and hit their lowest in a year.The FTSEurofirst 300 fell 1.8 percent to end at 975.02 onFriday.
