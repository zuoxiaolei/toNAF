<raw><![CDATA[ * Dubai 2010 gap 6 bln dirhams vs 4.2 bln set for 2009 * Revenues set at 29.4 bln dirhams, expenditure at 35.4 bln  DUBAI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Dubai's ruler approved the Gulfemirate's 2010 budget with a deficit of 2 percent of grossdomestic product, deeper than last year and in line with abudget committee's proposal, the government said on Thursday. Dubai, a member of the United Arab Emirates federation,received a last-minute bailout from fellow emirate Abu Dhabilast month to avoid a default on billions of dollars worth ofdebt of one of its flagship companies. "The general budget of the government of Dubai represents abalance between necessities of supporting and stimulating theeconomy on one side and committing to financial rules and soundprinciples of managing public funds on the other," Dubai financedepartment chief Abdulrahman al-Saleh was quoted as saying in agovernment statement sent to Reuters by a banking source. Saleh declined to comment on figures when contacted byReuters. The 2010 budget gap is projected at 6 billion dirhams ($1.63billion), up from a 4.2 billion gap envisaged for 2009, thestatement said. The government revenues are projected to reach29.4 billion dirhams, while expenditure stands at 35.4 billion. The 2010 investment spending is set at 10.7 billion dirhams,which accounts for 30 percent of total expenditures. Dubai had forecast its first ever deficit for its 2009budget at 1.3 percent of the emirate's 2007 GDP. The final 2009data are not available. The emirate is trying to keep its budgetgap below 3 percent of GDP. The emirate, facing a debt pile estimated at $80 billion,has ordered government departments to transfer all revenues tothe treasury in a move to better control financial flows. Analysts have said tax-free Dubai might consider selling itsassets to boost revenues as well as raise fees and charges orintroduce more paid-for services similar to its road tollsystem. Dubai has received a $10 billion dollar lifeline from AbuDhabi to repay a $4.1 billion bond for Nakheel, a property armof its debt-laden Dubai World, and other obligations. State-owned Dubai World is still to negotiate a standstilldeal on $22 billion worth of debt with its creditors. The UAE federation and Abu Dhabi banks provided Dubai, knownfor ambitious projects, with overall financial aid worth $25billion this year.
