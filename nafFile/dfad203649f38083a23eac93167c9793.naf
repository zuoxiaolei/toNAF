A day after global equities touched 15-month highs on thefirst day of 2010, some investors took a pause in theirrisk-taking activity, yet were still upbeat about marketdirection. The MSCI's all-country world stock index was up 0.19 pct, still at levels not seen since October 2008.While the MSCI emerging market index  was up 1.09percent, the highest level since August 2008, before thecollapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers triggeredfinancial recession worldwide. "I think the underlying trend for the short-term is stillup. Corporate confidence is very high and earnings arecontinuing to be revised up. The picture now is for a moresolid type of recovery outlook," said Mike Lenhoff, strategistat Brewin Dolphin in London. The CBOE volatility index , Wall Street's mainbarometer of investor fear, fell 2.35 percent. A drop in theso-called VIX index indicates improved investor sentiment. U.S. stocks briefly extended losses after pending homesales in November dropped 16 percent after rising for ninestraight months. But the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq erased the losses after themanufacturing sector showed further signs of improvement forthe month of November and offering assurance the economicrecovery remained on track.[ID:nN0558808] The Dow Jones industrial average  was down 0.2percent at 10,562.87. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 0.18 percent, at 1,134.99. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 0.01 percent, at 2,308.71. The U.S. dollar was pressured by the drop in pending homesales as investors were skeptical about the stabilization ofthe housing market. "The dollar ... is acting in a more traditional fashion andweakening on poor U.S. data," said Jacob Oubina, seniorcurrency strategist, at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. The U.S. dollar was down against a basket of six majorcurrencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index  down 0.10 percentat 77.446. The euro  was slightly up at $1.4419, havingclimbed to around $1.4483 earlier in the day to hit itsstrongest in nearly three weeks. The dollar  fell more than 1.0 percent to 91.52 yen,on track for its biggest one-day percentage loss in nearly amonth. U.S. Treasury debt prices were up as bargain huntingpersisted in the wake of recent losses, with benchmark 10-yearnotes  up 10/32 in price, yielding 3.78 percent,versus 3.82 percent at Monday's close. Last week, 10-year yields rose as high as 3.918 percent,their highest since early June, after surprisingly strongweekly jobless claims figures bolstered expectations among somethat Friday's payrolls report will show employment growth. The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European sharesclosed down 0.1 percent after the U.S. home sales data. "The housing figure from the U.S. did put a bit of dampeneron everything. If that housing market gives in the U.S. then itwould be seriously bad news for the recovery." Drugmakers took the most points off the European indexafter France cancelled over half the flu vaccines it ordered tocombat the H1N1 flu virus.
