<raw><![CDATA[   * BP-Reliance could build an LNG terminal for India sales * Sees domestic gas prices rising * No current plans to invest in coal-bed methane blocks (Adds details) By Nidhi Verma and Jo Winterbottom NEW DELHI, Feb 24 (Reuters) - BP PLC figures there are atleast 15 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas resources in the 23blocks it has bought into in its $7.2 billion deal withReliance Industries, its India head said, enough to meet thecountry's current rate of consumption for 7 years. Sashi Mukundan also told Reuters that gas prices in theIndian market had the potential to rise and, if necessary, thetwo firms would build a terminal to import liquefied naturalgas (LNG) to take advantage of growing demand for market-pricedgas. According to BP's Energy Outlook 2030, India's daily gasconsumption in 2010 was estimated at 6.1 billion cubic feet(bcf) and is expected to exceed 15 bcf in 2030. "BP's estimate today is that (the 23 blocks) have 15 tcfgas resources ... there is a much larger running room and ourcoming into this (shows) we believe that we can jointlysignificantly improve the production," Mukundan said in aThursday interview. Reliance's D6 block in the Krishna Godavari basin off theeast coast is India's biggest gas producer, but output hasslipped on technical problems to about 52 million cubic metresa day (mcmd) from 60 mcmd in 2010, and short of a target 80mcmd. Mukundan was speaking to Reuters a day after returning fromthe UK, where the companies signed the deal -- the biggestforeign direct investment in India's exploration sector. The Indian partnership marks the second major deal underBP's new chief executive Bob Dudley, who last month agreed ashare swap with Russia's state-controlled Rosneft to jointlyexplore the Arctic for offshore oil and gas. It is BP's biggest investment in the exploration andproduction space in Asia. The deal plants it firmly in itsfourth emerging BRIC economy, along with operations in Braziland China, after it picked up little in Indian governmentlicensing rounds. "We missed the boat until NELP V," Mukundan said, addingthat in 1999, when India launched its New Exploration LicensingPolicy (NELP), gas prices were too low and the potential of thecountry was not widely known. Cairn Energy, which picked up blocks in India before thelaunch of NELP, is trying to sell a majority stake in itsIndian arm Cairn India to Vedanta Resources but is bogged downin a royalty dispute with its Indian partner. HINDU WEDDING BP has no current plans to buy into Reliance's coal-bedmethane blocks, Mukundan added. "We have seen good shows in Mahanadi, Krishna Godavari andwe have seen some shows in Cauvery, which we now look to buildupon ... there is a potential for us to significantly grow," hesaid. Mukundan said the deal was exclusive to both the companiesand they could jointly look at further alliances. "This is a Hindu wedding. This will last forever. That'sthe plan," he said, when asked about the duration of thetie-up. The equal joint venture between the two companies formarketing and sourcing of gas should be operational in three tosix months, Mukundan said, to meet growing demand in theworld's second-fastest growing major economy. "The (gas pricing) trend is upward ... the market hasappetite for higher priced gas," he said. "Latent demand is being fully utilised and ... new demandwill be created on market fundamentals. It's not going to bebased on subsidy regime." India approves the gas sales pricing formula from morerecent fields, while older fields awarded to state-run firmshave a subsidised price of $4.2/million British thermal unit(mbtu). Mukundan said that 25-30 percent of India's gas consumptionis met by imported liquefied natural gas, which is sold at amuch higher price, and added that the government could agreehigher prices for future field developments. "The government is flexible to look at each of the blockson its own merit. There is a discussion that some of the moredifficult blocks will probably end up with higher pricing." He said the joint venture could build an LNG terminal andpipelines if it could not find capacity at India's existingfacilities. "If we can't get it and we still need to get it, we'll lookat the possibility of building our own terminal if needed."(Editing by Malini Menon and Tony Munroe)             ]]></raw>
