<raw><![CDATA[ * Australia central banker squashes bets on Feb rate hike * Korean markets jittery over possible early rate rise * All eyes on the Fed. Will it change policy outlook? * Japan bank stocks surge on capital rule grace period   By Kevin Plumberg HONG KONG, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Shifting views on interestrates in 2010 whipsawed markets on Wednesday, with theAustralian dollar tumbling as investors scaled back their betson aggressive rate hikes, while U.S. Treasuries rose before thelast Federal Reserve meeting this year. Asian stocks mainly slid on profit taking, though priceaction was exaggerated by thin trading volumes heading into theyear-end. European shares were also expected to open lower and U.S.stock futures eased as investors braced for the Fed's ratedecision and accompanying statement later in the day. Japanese bank shares provided a bright spot, surging on areport that global regulators would give banks a long graceperiod before applying stricter capital rules. A rise in U.S. wholesale prices last month, which pushed upTreasury yields overnight, prompted speculation the Fed mayhave to account for these pressures in its post-meetingstatement, though Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a letter toa congressman that inflation is not a problem. The U.S. dollar was little changed ahead after rising onTuesday to a 2-1/2-month high against the euro. The euro wasaround $1.4535 The Fed will release its statement at 1915 GMT. "Investors were concerned that if data continues to beatexpectations on the growth and price fronts, the Fed willchange its tack," Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief investmentstrategist with SJS Markets in Hong Kong, said in a note. "We do not see the Fed hiking until 2011 and attribute partof the gain to year-end profit taking after a long downwardtrend. The greenback is likely to resume declines." With the global economy gradually recovering from theworst slump in generations, investors are carefully weighing whencentral banks and governments will begin withdrawing massiveemergency stimulus measures, and if they can unwind suchpolicies without disrupting financial markets. A top Australian central banker stunned markets onWednesday by saying interest rates there were back to normal,prompting investors to slash bets that the Reserve Bank ofAustralia would raise rates a fourth consecutive time inFebruary. That piled pressure on the Aussie which was already inretreat after data showed the economy grew a meagre 0.2 percentin the third quarter, half as much as expected. MCE- The Australian dollar fell 0.9 percent to US$0.8981 to itslowest since Nov. 27, while March bill futures were up 0.1point as expectations of aggressive rate hikes receded. JAPAN BANKS THRIVE In Japan, shares of No.2 Mizuho Financial Group vaulted 15percent and third-ranked Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group surged14 percent on expectations that banks may not have to raisemore funds in the near term through massive and dilutive sharesales. The Nikkei business daily reported that the Basel Committeeon Banking Supervision had agreed to establish a transitionperiod of at least 10 years for new capital rules. Three sources later said global regulators would give banksa grace period before forcing them to implement strictercapital regulations, but a spokesman for Japan's FinancialServices Agency said no such agreement had been reached at thistime. The Nikkei share average closed at a seven-week high, up0.9 percent, leading Asian stock markets. "One of the biggest problems for the Nikkei has been supplyand worry about additional equity fundraising, and if this newsis true it means that we don't need to worry about this,especially in connection with banks, for a while," saidNagayuki Yamagishi, a strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securitiesin Tokyo. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan wasdown 0.8 percent, weighed by the materials and consumer staplessectors. The index remained near the middle of a 34-point rangeit has held since October as a global equity rally began tolose steam The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note edgeddown to 3.57 percent after jumping to 3.62 percent on Tuesday,the highest since August. March 10-year U.S. Treasury futures were up slightly. The gyrations in long-dated Treasuries notwithstanding,shorter maturity bonds have been relatively stable, suggestingthe market is still sceptical the Fed is close to signalling achange in policy stance. The difference of the 10-year yield over the 2-year yield,which is usually the most sensitive to policy rate moves, is272 basis points, having steepened 37 basis points sinceOctober. Still, unease about the course of monetary policy in 2010was very apparent in markets. Foreign investors bailed from South Korean government debt,pushing down March futures as much as 35 ticks on nervousnessabout a possible rate hike and other tightening measures earlynext year. Oil hovered below $71 a barrel after snapping a nine-daylosing streak on Tuesday, buoued by data showing a deepdrawdown in U.S. heating oil and diesel stockpiles. Gold was little changed at $1,125.90 per ounce as traderswaited to see if the Fed would provide any clues on the timingof interest rate moves.
