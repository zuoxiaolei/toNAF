<raw><![CDATA[ * China c.bank signals interest rate rise not imminent * Higher borrowing costs "a heavy-duty weapon" * China aims to improve FX regime, reduce trade surplus By Kevin Plumberg and Clare Jim HONG KONG, March 25 (Reuters) - A senior Chinese centralbanker on Thursday played down the need for an imminent rise inborrowing costs to keep a balance between growth and inflationin the world's third-largest economy. Zhu Min, a deputy governor of the People's Bank of China,reaffirmed the central bank's intention to refine itsexchange-rate regime but gave no clue as to when it might dropthe yuan's 20-month-old peg to the dollar.  "China should, China would, continue to improve its managedfloating exchange rate regime based on market demand referencedto a basket of currencies," Zhu said. "We should and we could," he told the Credit Suisse AsianInvestment Conference. China is under intense pressure from Washington to let theyuan resume its rise in order to reduce its trade surplus. The United States, saddled with near double-digitunemployment, argues that the yuan is unfairly undervalued,giving Chinese exporters an edge in global markets that destroysU.S. jobs. "China should and could import more and keep the surplussmall. I think this is good for China and this is good for theworld," said Zhu, who is due to take up a senior post at theInternational Monetary Fund in May. He said the PBOC was concerned about containing inflationexpectations but signalled that it was wary of endangeringgrowth by jacking up interest rates when it has otherinstruments in its policy toolkit that it can use first. "Interest rates are part of the whole thing, not necessarilythe issue," said Zhu, speaking in English. So far this year the PBOC has twice raised the proportion ofdeposits that banks must hold in reserve instead of lending out.The central bank has also drained large volumes of cash from thebanking system through open market operations. But, unlike the central banks of Australia, Malaysia,Vietnam and -- last Friday -- India, the PBOC has not changedits benchmark interest rates. "When we cope with inflation expectations, we are verycareful. We want to make sure we maintain stability, liquidityand growth. We are very careful with interest rates: this is aheavy-duty weapon," Zhu said. EURO WOES He reiterated the central bank's wish to see a smooth paceof lending throughout the year and said loan growth was likelyto slow further this month after halving in February to 700billion yuan. The bank has instructed banks to reduce total net newlending this year to 7.5 trillion yuan from a record 9.6trillion in 2009, when lenders scrambled to put loans on theirbooks to support the government's economic recovery plan. Zhu singled out sovereign debt strains as one of the risksfacing the global economy. Greece's fiscal woes were a long-termproblem that was not amenable to a quick fix, he said. "We don't see decisive actions telling the market we cansolve this," he said. The euro  on Thursday fell to its lowest level againstthe dollar since last May as a ratings agency downgrade ofGreece, coupled with political deadlock in the euro zone overhow to help Greece, soured sentiment towards the singlecurrency.
