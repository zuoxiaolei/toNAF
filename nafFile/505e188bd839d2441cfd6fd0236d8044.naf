<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The euro was down against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, hovering above a 7-week low as European financial leaders continued to press Ireland to accept a bailout.EUR/USD hit 1.3468 during late Asian trade, a daily low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3486, shedding 0.04%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.3380, the low of September 28 and resistance at 1.3654, Tuesday’s high.Some euro-zone members were pushing for a bailout deal for Ireland to be finalized at a meeting of European finance ministers set to end later in the day, amid fears that Ireland's problems could spread into other vulnerable euro zone countries, such as Portugal and Spain.However Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan repeated that his country wasn't ready to seek help but said "urgent talks" were necessary to calm "serious market disturbances" that "jeopardize not only Ireland, they threaten the euro zone."  On Tuesday, European Union President Herman Van Rompuy said that Ireland’s debt crisis had precipitated a survival crisis for the EU. "We all have to work together in order to survive with the euro zone, because if we don't survive with the euro zone, we will not survive with the European Union," he said.Meanwhile, the euro was up against the pound with EUR/GBP rising 0.11% to hit 0.8501.Later in the day, the U.S. was to release official data on inflation, building permits and housing starts.             ]]></raw>
