<raw><![CDATA[ By Nick Tattersall LAGOS, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Nigeria's central bank slicedthrough the hubris of the business elite with its $2.6 billionbank bailout, starting what could be a new era for corporategovernance in one of Africa's most important economies. Last Friday's capital injection into Afribank, Finbank,Intercontinental Bank, Oceanic Bank and Union Bank and thesacking of their heads was unprecedented in Nigerian corporatehistory. Recently appointed Central Bank Governor Lamido Sanusi saidlax governance had allowed the banks to become so weaklycapitalised that they posed a threat to the entire system, anddescribed the move as the beginning of a "restoration ofconfidence" in sub-Saharan Africa's second biggest economy. The 1.14 trillion naira ($7.6 billion) in bad loans run upby the banks is roughly equivalent to the combined annual incomeof the poorest 20 million people in Africa's most populousnation, each of whom live on around $1 a day. Yet the "Friday massacre", as one newspaper dubbed it, setBlackberries buzzing in Lagos champagne bars not because of thebreathtaking scale of the money involved, but because of themight of the corporate aristocrats felled by Sanusi's axe. "Ordinarily in Nigeria there is a sacred cow culture," saidReuben Abati, a respected leader writer and chairman of theeditorial board of Nigeria's Guardian newspapers. "Once someone is prominent in a particular industry youassume those persons are untouchable. What Sanusi has done nowis to say nobody is too big to be held accountable, whether theyare an Ibru or an Akingbola." Cecilia Ibru and Erastus Akingbola -- the former chiefexecutives of Oceanic Bank and Intercontinental Bank -- werearguably the highest-profile casualties of the cull, titans in acorporate elite dominated by egos and empire builders. Ibru is from one of Nigeria's most powerful businessfamilies, whose interests range from shipping and hotels to oiland media. Akingbola is president of Nigeria's CharteredInstitute of Bankers and brimming with honorary doctorates. "Some are born great, others achieve greatness, while othersstill have greatness thrust upon them. But rarely do we havethese three attributes combined so well in an individual as isthe case in our Dr. Erastus Bankole Oladipo Akingbola," blaststhe biography on his website, erastusakingbola.com.  HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN In his trademark bow-tie and frameless spectacles, Sanusi'sslight physique and measured rhetoric mark him out from some ofthe more flamboyant personalities it is his job to regulate. "Anybody, managing director, executive director, director,officers, debtor, anybody that is found that has broken the lawwill be prosecuted to the full extent of the law," Sanusi toldreporters when he announced the bailout. "The debtor, the management, we do not intend to allow anyinfractions to go unaccounted for," he said, as armed policesecured the headquarters of the five institutions last Friday. Some Nigerian commentators have argued that the cull bySanusi, a northerner, targeted southern bank executives and thatit was a retaliation for consolidation four years ago which sawsome northern banks absorbed by their southern peers. But the forensic precision of Sanusi's public statementsleft the numbers to speak for themselves. The loans they racked up -- including credit to speculatorson a stock market which fell 60 percent over the past year andunsecured financing to fuel importers who have seen oil priceshalve -- meant the five were constant borrowers of public money. They accounted for almost 90 percent of exposure to thecentral bank's discount window, a facility which allows banks tomeet short-term obligations by borrowing central bank funds. The results of Sanusi's audit have left many wondering howthe five banks managed to survive for so long. Intercontinental and Oceanic had both won national andinternational banking awards. Analysts from brokerage Renaissance Capital were shownIntercontinental Bank's balance sheet in April and published areport saying it had enough capital to absorb its asset risksand there was no threat to its solvency. Ibru was quoted in this month's edition of McKinsey &Company's business journal McKinsey Quarterly as saying: "Infive to 10 years, we expect to be a well-known, established bankbeyond this sub-region of Africa." "When the dust settles, one of the most shocking aspects ofthis crisis is going to be the magnitude of the gap between therot in the system and what its leaders wanted us to believe,"said one Nigerian analyst, who declined to be named.
