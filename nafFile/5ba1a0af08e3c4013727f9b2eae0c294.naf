<raw><![CDATA[ * Commodities continue retreat, hit world stocks 0.5 percent * Dollar up 0.5 pct; euro hit by Portugal auction, bank debt * Oil tumbles back below $89 a barrel, copper ebbs 2 percent  By Mike Dolan and Jeremy Gaunt LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - World equities, oil prices and theeuro retreated from early new year highs on Wednesday, withunderlying economic optimism reined in by wariness aboutlingering debt woes, possible data surprises and wildcard risks. In a pattern investors say may well be repeated throughout2011, a burst of new year investor optimism over the past weekquickly fell prey to profit taking and correlation trading thatautomatically links moves in one security to the buying orselling of another. Commodity price falls -- which some say were accelerated bya fall in the flood-hit Australian dollar and generalised U.S.dollar strength -- continued for a second day in a row. This, inturn, all put pressure on previously buoyant world equities. Oil, which had only a few days ago looked to be heading to$100 a barrel again, fell back below $89 a barrel in London..Prices of both commodities and equities, however, remainedaround at multi-year highs. World stocks as measured by MSCI were down 0.5 percent,though still within a few points of highs last seen in the thirdquarter of 2008. Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 was down 1.0 percent. Earlier,Japan's Nikkei closed down nearly 0.2 percent after hitting a7-1/2 month closing high on Tuesday. "There might just be an element of nerves creeping back intothe market as investors return to their desks," said KeithBowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  NEW YEAR HANGOVER A number of market moves were put down to investorsadjusting positions after end-of-year balancing of portfolios. Investors were also awaiting U.S. jobs data due on Fridayfor confirmation that the world's largest economy is recovering,a key factor in recent equity rallies. A early cut of themonth's private-sector employment reading was due on Wednesday. "Growth in the labour market is one of the biggest decidingfactors for markets this year, that is why we are seeinginvestors a bit cautious ahead of the (jobs) numbers. If the jobfigures are good, we could see a push higher," said David Jones,market strategist at IG Index.  The ADP National employment survey for December, a precursorto Friday's non-farm payrolls report, was due at 1315 GMT whileU.S. ISM non-manufacturing data was set for 1500 GMT. "There is some optimism with regards to the U.S. economy,but that is mixed with concerns over where Europe is going inthe short- to medium-term. We are likely to remain very datasensitive," Bowman at Hargreaves Lansdown said. Stocks related to commodities acted as the main drag onbourses. Anglo American, BHP Billiton, Kazakhmys and Rio Tinto shed 1.5 percent to 3 percent. Commodities were hit hard on Tuesday, with theReuters-Jefferies CRB index closing nearly 1.6 percent down asenergy, metals and agricultural investors took profits on theheady gains made on thin holiday volume over the past two weeks. The sell-off continued in some areas on Wednesday. Copperfutures, for example, fell two percent in London. The Australiandollar was down about 0.5 percent. European chemical shares were among the fallers, with theSTOXX Europe 600 chemicals index down 1.6 percent on concernsabout a slowdown in world demand. Chemicals market leader BASF fell 3.3 percent, with traderspointing to profit taking following a strong run. The stock hadgained almost 22 percent since early October.  FIRMER DOLLAR The dollar took some of the blame for commodities' slide,holding firm on hopes for U.S. economic recovery. Market players said the dollar's rise and the partly relateddrop in commodities this week have been driven by positionunwinding. "The move over the past two weeks was somewhat exaggerated,having taken place in thin liquidity. With liquidity now comingback on stream, the markets are now reassessing some of themoves," said Sue Trinh, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. The dollar index, which measures the greenback's valueagainst major currencies, rose 0.4 percent to 79.75. The euro dipped 0.6 percent to $1.3212, with traders nervyover the higher yields paid by Portugal at its latest Treasurybill auction on Wednesday and reports about European Union plansto insist in future on senior creditors accepting writedowns onthe debt of ailing EU banks. Core German government bond yields fell as demand grew forsafer assets and peripheral euro government debt yields climbedafter the Portuguese auction. "On the face of it the auction met solid demand given thehealthy cover ratio, though this obviously comes at a muchhigher yield than the previous six-month Portuguese offeringlast September," said Credit Agricole strategist Orlando Green.
