<raw><![CDATA[ * Says strong C$ more than fully offsets good news * Repeats commitment to keep rates low through mid-2010 * Says inflation to reach bank's target later than thought * C$ fall, bonds rise (Adds comment and market reaction) By Randall Palmer OTTAWA, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada extinguishedspeculation on Tuesday that it would follow Australia in hikinginterest rates quickly, warning that favorable economicdevelopments were being undermined by the strength of theCanadian dollar. The bank kept its key overnight interest rate at a very low0.25 percent and reiterated its intention to keep it therethrough mid-2010. Far from giving any suggestion of an early exit from itsextended low-rate strategy, which is designed to stimulate theeconomy, the bank said return to economic normalcy would bedelayed. It said the output gap, reflecting excess supply in theeconomy, would not be closed until the third quarter of 2011,three months later than it had earlier forecast. It alsoforecast that inflation would not return to its 2 percenttarget until third quarter 2011, also a three-month delay. The bank's renewed commitment to keeping rates low and itsforecast of delays in the economy's turnaround helped weakenthe Canadian dollar  to C$1.0470, or 95.51 U.S. cents, bymid-morning from C$1.0320, or 96.90 U.S. cents, just before thereport. "Financial markets have been starting to price in thepossibility of a (rate) hike in March," Royal Bank of Canadaassistant chief economist Paul Ferley said. "So I thinkreiterating that commitment is possibly an attempt to take someof the steam out of the Canadian dollar." The Reserve Bank of Australia surprised markets on Oct. 6with a 25 basis-point rate hike, becoming the first of theGroup of 20 central banks to tighten credit as the globalfinancial crisis eases. There had been speculation in markets that the Bank ofCanada could also opt for an early rate rise due to a spate ofencouraging economic data.  The bank did say on Tuesday that global economic andfinancial conditions have been somewhat better than it forecastin July. Resumption of growth in Canada has been supported bymonetary and fiscal stimulus, increased household wealth,improving financial conditions, higher commodity prices andstronger business and consumer confidence, it said. "However, heightened volatility and persistent strength inthe Canadian dollar are working to slow growth and subdueinflation pressures. The current strength in the dollar isexpected, over time, to more than fully offset the favorabledevelopments since July," it said in its statement. Canadian government bond prices firmed after the statementwith the yield on the two-year bond falling to 1.545 percentfrom 1.618 percent beforehand.  "(The statement) solidifies the conditional commitmentthey've had in place for some time and it also suggests thatthey're not necessarily going to move policy aggressively anytime soon," Credit Suisse economist Jonathan Basile said. The bank said growth in Canada in the second half of thisyear would be slightly higher than previously projected butthat growth over the rest of its projection period would beslightly lower on average than it had forecast earlier. The central bank said the economy would shrink by 2.3percent this year, compared with the -2.4 percent it forecastin July. It forecast economic growth of 3.0 percent in 2010, but cutits forecast for growth in 2011 slightly to 3.3 percent from3.5 percent. It repeated that the underlying risks to its projectionwere roughly balanced but said that because it cannot cut ratesany further, the overall risks were slightly tilted to thedownside.
