<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro slips below $1.3200 to lowest in 2 months * Market looking beyond Ireland package * Euro/dlr vols show bias towards weakness (Adds quotes, detail, previous TOKYO)  By Anirban Nag LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near two-monthlows against the dollar on Monday as investors looked past arescue package for Ireland to debt problems in other peripheraleuro zone economies and sold the currency on any bounce. European Union finance ministers endorsed an 85 billion europackage to help Dublin cover bad bank debts and bridge itsbudget deficit, and approved outlines of a permanent crisis-resolution system which could make private bond holders sharethe burden of restructuring sovereign debt after 2013. A key question is whether the EU has done enough to stemcontagion to other euro zone members such as Portugal and Spain,a problem left unresolved after Greece was bailed out in May. "The euro remains a sell on rallies and any relief istemporary," said Ankita Dudani, G-10 currency strategist at RBSGlobal Banking. "Ireland is taken care of but now the questionis whether Portugal needs help this year or the first thing nextyear. And then you have Spain." The euro was up marginally at $1.3255, having fallen as faras $1.3182 earlier in Asia. It fell through its 100-day movingaverage on Friday, a bearish signal, and the next target is its200-day moving average currently at $1.3131. Euro/dollar implied volatilities maintained their recentascent, reflecting nervousness about the single currency.One-month inched up to 14.35 percent from 13.60 on Friday, whilerisk-reversals increasingly bid for the downside. The one-month25-delta was trading around 1.95 for euro puts versus 1.85 onFriday. Many traders think the European Financial StabilityFacility, a joint EU-IMF fund created in May, may not haveenough funds to support Spain if it needs help. "The difficulty for the market is to allow itself the luxuryof letting these developments get traction in a currency marketwhere buying the euro is still akin to catching the fallingknife," Daragh Maher, deputy head of global foreign exchangeresearch at CIB wrote.   IRELAND TO IBERIA Ireland said the emergency loans would run for an average of7.5 years, and EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn saidthe final interest rate was likely to be about 6 percent,slightly lower than some had expected. Another source of uncertainty is a lack of details on aFranco-German proposal to make private bondholders share theburden of losses on sovereign debt restructuring. European Central Bank policymaker Christian Noyer brushedaside the possibility of investors taking losses or "haircuts"on sovereign bonds. The market showed a muted response. Analysts said the market would be on the lookout for whetherECB policymakers, meeting on Thursday, would go ahead and removesome of the emergency measures put in place earlier this year. While some analysts think the Irish package would reduceIrish banks' need for ECB funding, RBS's Dudani said euro zonebanks were still grappling with funding problems and theemergency measures were needed. The euro's uptick saw the dollar index dip to 80.256. Itrose to its highest level in two months against a basket ofmajor currencies at 80.652 earlier in the session. The dollar briefly hit a two-month high of 84.20 yen, butretreated to 83.95 yen, down 0.2 percent for the day. The Swedish crown rose to a one-month high versus the euroafter Swedish third-quarter growth came in much stronger thanforecast. The euro fell to 9.2180 crowns, its lowest since Oct.26, compared to around 9.25 before the data. (Additional reporting by Charlotte Cooper and Hideyuki Sanoin Tokyo)             ]]></raw>
