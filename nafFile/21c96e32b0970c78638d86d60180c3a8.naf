<raw><![CDATA[ * Greece hurts euro; dollar, yen gain on risk aversion * Yen gains capped after Japan lawmaker talks intervention * Sterling hit by political uncertainty; Aussie falls (Recasts, adds quotes, update prices; changes dateline,previous LONDON and byline) NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - The dollar gained againstthe euro on Friday on concerns about how Greece will serviceits debt, with the dollar and the yen advancing as investorscut positions in riskier currencies. The Japanese currency pared gains, however, after alawmaker from Japan's ruling party said monetary easing andintervention to weaken the yen were needed to beat deflation. Greece asked on Thursday asked for talks with Europeanauthorities and the International Monetary Fund, a step towardAthens obtaining support via an aid plan agreed last weekend. Concerns remain about how the deal will work in practice,however, and the premium demanded to buy Greek government bondsrather than German bonds rose further. "After yesterday's letter sent to the EU and the IMF, themarket took that as a sign Greece is very close to where theywill need to ask for financial assistance," said MatthewStrauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets inToronto. In early New York trade, the euro was down 0.6 percentagainst the dollar at $1.3497, just off a one-week low of$1.3490. The $1.3500 level was seen as key because it marks the peakreached last Friday before the single currency gapped higherafter the weekend in response to the agreement on terms of theGreek bailout deal. "We think that the euro will remain under pressurebecause we have serious concerns about whether the eurocan still be considered a hard currency," said Morgan StanleyGlobal Currency Research Team in a note to clients. Gains in the dollar were capped however, particularly afterU.S. two-year Treasury yields fell below 1 percent for thefirst time in three weeks. "U.S. yields below 1 percent is likely to feed through intothe idea that the Fed will retain its stance that rates willremain low for some time," said Tom Levinson, currencystrategist at ING in London. Top U.S. Federal Reserve officials have showed littleurgency to softening the central bank's commitment to holdrates low for a long time, suggesting the Fed will repeat thepledge when it meets later this month. YEN PARES GAINS Against the yen, the euro fell 0.9 percent to 125.13 yen.The dollar fell 0.3 percent against the yen to 92.72 yen buttrading had been volatile after the Japanese lawmaker'scomments. "(The comments) have got the market a bit jittery. It lookslike we could be moving back to the old road of needing toweaken the yen," said David Bloom, global head of currencyresearch at HSBC in London. Traders said stop loss orders for the dollar were thoughtto be placed from 92.50 yen down to 92.20 yen. A Commerce Department report showing U.S. housing startsrose more than expected in March to their highest level sinceNovember 2008 and permits to build new homes scaled a 17- monthhigh had only momentary impact on foreign exchange investors.The dollar briefly pared losses against the yen beforereturning to lower levels. Sterling fell on concerns a May 6 UK election may result inno one party winning a majority, as polls showed the heads ofthe two main parties were beaten in a TV debate by the leaderof the third party, the Liberal Democrats. Sterling fell 0.6 percent against the dollar to $1.5415,while risk aversion pushed the higher-yielding Australiandollar down 0.6 percent to $0.9295.
