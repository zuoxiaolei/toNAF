<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The euro slipped against the U.S. dollar on Monday, ahead of a summit of euro zone finance ministers in Brussels that was not expected to yield any specific measures to bail out debt-laden Greece.  EUR/USD dropped to 1.3579 during the Asian trading session. It subsequently bounced to hover around 1.3609, although it was still down 0.16%. The pair was likely to find resistance at 1.3839, last Tuesday's high, and short-term support at 1.3531, Friday's low – which was also a fresh 8-month low.  The European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said on Sunday that Greece must take all appropriate measures to fix its gaping budget deficit.  "All of Greece must realize that it must correct a trajectory which has been aberrant," he said on French TV channel LCI, referring to Greece's past mistakes. Trichet added that scrutiny of the country's economic indicators must be heightened.  Meanwhile, the euro rose slightly against the yen and the pound: EUR/JPY rose 0.04% to hit 122.67 and EUR/GBP rose 0.04% to hit 0.8685.             ]]></raw>
