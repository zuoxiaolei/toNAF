<raw><![CDATA[ TOKYO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Top Japanese tyre maker BridgestoneCorp said on Wednesday the yen's current level does not hugelyaffect its earnings or long-term business strategy because it hasdiversified its operations around the world. "Foreign exchange rates at current levels do not do much harmto our earnings," President Shoshi Arakawa told a newsconference. "I think it is not necessary to review our sales orproduction strategy for the long term if the dollar stays around85 yen," he said, adding that a stronger yen at such levels as 83yen to the dollar would not prompt the company to review itsstrategy either. "The recent strength of the yen has not prompted us toconsider accelerating the shift of our Japanese operations ormoving our headquarters abroad," he added. The yen strengthened to a 15-year high against the dollar anda nine-year peak against the euro on Tuesday, threatening theoutlook for a strong profit recovery at Japanese exporters likecar and auto parts makers. Bridgestone has forecast the dollar to average 91 yen and theeuro 115 yen this year. The greenback was trading around 84.60 yen at 0930 GMT onWednesday. Arakawa said that every one-yen decline in the dollar trimsits annual revenues by 17 billion yen ($202 million) andoperating profit by 1.8 billion yen.
