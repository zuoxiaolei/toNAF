<raw><![CDATA[ BEIJING, Feb 26 (Reuters) - China is conducting "stresstests" in the country's labour-intensive export sectors to seehow much yuan appreciation firms can withstand, the local 21stCentury Business Herald reported on Friday. The newspaper cited industry sources as saying that theresults of the test, conducted jointly by the Ministry ofCommerce and the Ministry of Industry and InformationTechnology, would serve as a reference for the government'sfuture yuan policy. It added that these tests did not mean that Beijing wasabout to let the yuan  appreciate, having frozen it inplace against the dollar since mid-2008 as the government hastried to cushion exporters from the global financial crisis. Nevertheless, the report marks a rare discussion in Chinesemedia about the feasible scope for yuan appreciation and comesamid rising speculation that Beijing may be on the verge ofallowing yuan appreciation to resume. [ID:nSGE61L0EX] According to the initial results of the tests, which focusedon textile, garment, shoe and toy exporters, every percentagepoint of yuan appreciation would erode one percentage point oftheir profit margin. This would be a serious blow toprofitability since their net profit margin is often only 3 to 5percent, the newspaper said. China has consistently said it will keep the yuan basicallystable, a line that the commerce ministry repeated on Thursday.[ID:nTOE61O03M] A bipartisan group of 15 U.S. senators on Thursday insistedChina's currency practices are effectively a subsidy and urgedCommerce Secretary Gary Locke to consider action against Chineseimports.
