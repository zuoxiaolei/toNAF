<raw><![CDATA[ * March CPI rate falls to 4.0 pct from 4.4 pct in Feb * Inflation fall puts BoE May rate rise in doubt * Retail sales show worst drop in at least 16 years in March * UK trade deficit narrowest since Feb 2010  (Adds context, wraps in BRC retail sales data) By David Milliken and Peter Griffiths LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - British inflation eased inMarch for the first time since last summer as grocers cut foodprices, providing the Bank of England with fresh leeway to holdinterest rates steady to support the still shaky economy. The unexpected drop in annual inflation to 4.0 percent from4.4 percent in February -- together with a sharp decline inretail sales -- gives ammunition to those policymakers who wantto see the economy on a solid footing before tackling inflation. Sterling fell and gilt futures extended an earlier rallythat had been driven by speculation about a soft inflationnumber. "It should help to stave off a rate rise in May," saidPhilip Shaw, an economist at Investec. "But while this iswelcome, this is just one battle in what will be a long tussle.It's still possible inflation will rise to 5 percent over thecourse of the year." The fall in the CPI rate last month was aided by anon-seasonally adjusted 1.4 percent month-on-month drop in thecost of food and non-alcoholic drinks, which the ONS said wasdriven by supermarket discounting.  HIGH STREET WOES The BoE faces a dilemma as it tries to tame inflation --still at twice its 2 percent target -- without derailing afragile economic recovery after the economy contracted at theend of last year. Britain's high street is suffering from a poisonous mix of arising cost of living, higher taxes and downbeat consumermorale, and business leaders urged the BoE to stay away fromraising borrowing costs too soon. The British Retail Consortium said total sales, a measurewhich includes new floorspace, fell by 1.9 percent in March ,the worst drop since the BRC began collecting the data in 1995.Like-for-like sales were 3.5 percent lower on the year. "This is strong evidence of the pressure customers andtraders are under," said BRC Director General Stephen Robertson."Uncomfortably high inflation and low wage growth have producedthe first year-on-year fall in disposable incomes for 30 years." The trade body urged policymakers to delay raising rates,saying a hike "would do more harm than good". Companies such as Dixons, Britain's biggestelectricals retailer, electricals group Kesa, carpet sellerCarpetright and car parts retailer Halfords have warned aboutthe tough outlook.  GROWTH The sales slump came on top of a recent suprise drop inindustrial production and a weak rebound in construction inFebruary, casting doubts about the strength of the recovery. Consumer price inflation has been above the Bank ofEngland's 2 percent target since December 2009, driven higher bya mix of a weak exchange rate, rising commodity prices and twosuccessive annual increases in sales tax. Last week, the BoE opted to hold rates at a record low of0.5 percent, breaking step with the European Central Bank whichraised the cost of borrowing for the first time since the 2008financial crisis. Economists say the majority of policymakers who voted forsteady rates in past months would want to see a strong economicrebound before tightening policy. "We suggest a GDP figure of around 1 percentquarter-on-quarter and PMIs in excess of 55 would be required toget a majority in favour of a very modest hike," ING analystJames Knightley said. In some good news for the economy, separate ONS data showedthat Britain's trade deficit for goods and services fell to itssmallest level since February 2010. That suggests net trade willprovide a bigger contribution to first-quarter GDP figures duelater in April. The ONS said that Britain's total global trade deficit fellto 2.443 billion pounds ($4 billion) in February from 3.858billion pounds in January, driven by an unexpected fall in thedeficit for goods. Manufacturers have reported stronger exports for severalmonths, but this has been slow to show up in official data. (Editing by Stephen Nisbet)             ]]></raw>
