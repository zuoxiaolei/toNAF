<raw><![CDATA[ BEIJING, Feb 17 (Reuters) - China's Ministry of Commerce hasasked for opinions from other ministries about the idea ofcutting import taxes on a range of goods, two sources familiarwith the move said on Thursday. One of the sources, an official who had seen a MofComdocument sent out after the Lunar New Year holiday earlier thismonth, said MofCom was hoping to encourage imports of resourcesand hi-tech goods that China lacks. But details still need discussion by various ministries andthe final plan would need approval from China's cabinet before itcould become reality, the source said. Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Nobody at China's Commerce Ministry or Finance Ministry wasimmediately available to comment on the plan.
