<raw><![CDATA[ * Market cheers opposition win in Japanese vote * Chinese stocks drop 6.7 percent, stoking risk aversion * Dollar gains versus sterling, Aussie, Canadian dollars By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The yen rose to a 7-week highagainst the dollar and gained versus other currencies onMonday, buoyed by a decisive opposition victory in Japaneseelections and as declines in global equities stoked riskaversion. A 6.7 percent slump in Chinese stocks sent investorsflocking to the yen for safety. The U.S. dollar, anothersafe-haven currency, also rose against perceived higher-riskcurrencies, such as sterling and the Australian dollar. A landslide win Sunday by the Democratic Party of Japan(DPJ) sparked hopes that new policies will support consumerspending in an economy trapped in deflation and haunted by aweak growth outlook. While the outcome lifted the Japanese currency, traderssaid gains could be limited on jitters over what a newgovernment may herald. "There's a bit of risk aversion in the market this morning,really on the back of (the fall in) Chinese equities," saidCamilla Sutton, senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital inToronto. Trading was quiet, however, with U.K. markets closed for apublic holiday. The focus is on key events later in the week,including a European Central Bank policy meeting on Thursdayand U.S. non-farm payrolls figures due on Friday. In early New York trading, the dollar was down 0.3 percentat 93.16 yen, having earlier hit a low of 92.53 yen, accordingto Reuters data, its weakest level since mid-July. The eurolost 0.5 percent to 133.05 yen. The euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.4287. Provisional figuresreleased Monday showed euro zone inflation fell by 0.2 percentyear-on-year in August, slightly less than the 0.3 percentdecline forecast by economists. Chinese equities slid to a three-month closing low Mondayand recorded their second biggest monthly loss in 15 years,weighing on U.S. stocks and pushing oil prices to below $71 perbarrel. The oil-sensitive Canadian dollar underperformed, with theU.S. dollar rising 1.4 percent to C$1.1067. Canada's economy shrank at an annual rate of 3.4 percent inthe second quarter, a slightly sharper contraction thanexpected, following a 6.1 percent downturn in the firstquarter, Statistics Canada said Monday. UNCERTAINTY AHEAD Among riskier currencies, the Australian dollar fell 0.7percent against the dollar to $0.8362, while sterling declined0.3 percent against the dollar to $1.6226. Analysts said investors may be cautious about buying theyen too aggressively, given the uncertainty that will accompanythe advent of a new government in Japan as well as concernsover the country's high levels of government debt. A Reuters survey showed the Democratic Party of Japan'sstance on fiscal discipline remains a source of concern for themarkets, along with its stance on diplomacy, includingU.S.-Japan relations. "Whether (DPJ leader Yukio Hatoyama) can succeed intransforming the Japanese society and economy remains to beseen," said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research atGFT Forex in New York. "Nevertheless, the near-term impact of the DPJ win couldtranslate into further gains for the yen." Going forward, investors may also turn a wary eye topolitical developments in Germany ahead of a general electionon Sept. 27. Chancellor Angela Merkel's party suffered lossesin regional elections on Sunday.             ]]></raw>
