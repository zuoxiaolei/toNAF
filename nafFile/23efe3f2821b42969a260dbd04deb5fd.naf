<raw><![CDATA[ * Ambassador says China will open public tender markets * China is very worried about EU protectionism, envoy says * Envoy: yuan rise won't end imbalances, could hurt EU firms  (Adds details, background) By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck BRUSSELS, Dec 2 (Reuters) - China's envoy to the EuropeanUnion struck a conciliatory tone in a row over publicprocurement on Thursday, but warned the EU against growingprotectionism in the bloc. Speaking to deputies at the European Parliament, AmbassadorSong Zhe said Beijing would address EU concerns about a lack ofaccess to Chinese public works contracts. "Premier Wen (Jiabao) has promised we will make steady stepsto make improvements in these areas and for foreign businessesto grow in China. We will fulfil what we have promised," Songtold the trade committee of the European Parliament. European firms' frustrated attempts to enter the lucrativepublic tender market of China -- valued at about 10 percent ofChina's GDP -- have prompted EU warnings of reciprocal marketclosures across the 27-nation bloc. Song warned Europe against rising protectionism. Reelingfrom economic crisis, Europe has recently launched a range ofdefensive measures against cheap Chinese imports. "We are very much worried about the increasing number oftrade protectionism and antidumping measures adopted by theEuropean Union," Song said, speaking through an interpreter. The EU and the United States, among others, have accusedChina of keeping its currency artificially cheap, which hasresulted in global trade imbalances and undermined their ownindustries. While China says it is committed to reforming its currency,it insists it alone will decide how this is done. "It is not objective and it is unfair to put the blame ofdomestic unemployment ... on the undervalued renminbi," Songsaid. "The appreciation of the renminbi cannot help addressglobal imbalances." Song told the EU legislators China would push ahead withgradual currency reform, but that any sudden change wouldundermine the profitability of European firms operating inChina, where their operations outperform those in OECDcountries. He also emphasised China's willingness to help the EUovercome its economic downturn. "China has stood by the side of Europe to tide over thedifficulties. Our support for Europe is mutually beneficial andwin-win," he said. "We cannot save the European Union in absolute terms but weare willing to contribute our own share." Responding to foreign demands and internal economic reforms,China will further open its markets to foreign participation inthe booming services sector including finance, education, healthcare, IT and sports, Song said. "The important thing ... is to continue to reform and openup. We encourage our friends in Europe to have more patience."
