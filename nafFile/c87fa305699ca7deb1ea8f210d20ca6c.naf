<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The euro tumbled to a fresh all-time low against the safe haven Swiss franc on Wednesday, amid lingering concerns over the fiscal health of peripheral euro zone nations. EUR/CHF hit 1.2493 during European afternoon trade, a fresh record low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2505, shedding 0.37%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.2493 and resistance at 1.2711, Tuesday’s high.Lingering concerns over euro zone sovereign debt contagion continued to weigh on the single currency after ratings agency Fitch said late Tuesday that it may cut Greece’s credit ranking to non-investment grade within six weeks.Fitch said it expected a review of Greece’s “fiscal sustainability” to be completed in January and that there was a “heightened probability” of a downgrade.  Also Tuesday, ratings agency Moody’s Investor Service warned it may cut Portugal's A1 rating by one or two notches after a review that will take no more than three months.A report earlier in the day that China was planning to purchase between EUR4 billion and EUR5 billion of Portuguese sovereign debt to help the country fend off pressure in debt markets gave only a temporary boost to the euro. Elsewhere, the euro was up against the U.S. dollar, with EUR/USD gaining 0.11% to hit 1.3115.Earlier in the day, official data showed that German import prices rose to a 26-month high in November, rising by 1.2%, after declining by 0.2% in October. Analysts had expected German import prices to rise by 0.5% in November.             ]]></raw>
