<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen, dollar gain as equities, oil prices turn lower * Falls in equities, oil encourage profit-taking in risky FX * Aussie edges lower from 10-month highs after RBA * Some caution ahead of ECB, BoE decisions, US jobs data     (Adds quote, update prices, changes byline) By Jessica Mortimer LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The yen and the dollar gained onTuesday as falls in equity and oil prices encouraged investorsto take profits on some of the recent sharp gains in higher riskand commodity-based currencies. Investors' underlying positive stance towards risky assetsremained intact, however, and the euro continued to hover notfar from Monday's 2009 high against the dollar. European shares fell 0.8 percent, correcting lower afterhitting a 9-month high, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.7percent, pointing to a lower start on Wall Street after the S&P500 index topped the 1,000 mark on Monday. Analysts said this helped the yen and the dollar recoup someof their recent heavy losses, which accompanied a jump in riskappetite as investors became increasingly confident of animprovement in the global economy. "We have seen some consolidation and some profit-taking inhigher risk currencies, but the bias is still to the upside forrisk," Barclays Capital currency strategist Adarsh Sinha said. "We saw a big, big moves yesterday and on Friday andrelative to that the reversal in the dollar and the yen todayhas been small," he said. Better-than-expected second quarter company results,brighter manufacturing reports from the U.S., Europe and China,and stimulative policy measures have boosted hopes the globaleconomy may have bottomed out from its worst recession indecades. But analysts noted some caution ahead of key events thisweek, including policy decisions by the European Central Bankand the Bank of England on Thursday and U.S. non-farm payrollsdata on Friday. By 1127 GMT, the euro was down 0.2 percent against thedollar at $1.4385, though still not far from a nine-month highof $1.4445 hit on Monday.  Traders said some options with a strike price of $1.4450were set to expire later in the day, which may be capping moves. Technical analysts see the euro rising to $1.4720, hit inmid-December last year, and possibly pushing higher. The yen was the main outperformer, however, with the dollardown 0.6 percent at 94.73 yen and the euro down 0.8 percent at136.25 yen. The dollar earlier fell some two yen from the day's high to94.37 yen, as traders said selling accelerated after stop-losseswere hit at 94.50 yen. The dollar index was up slightly at 77.682, off a 10-monthlow of 77.415.  COMMODITY FX FALL Falls in the prices of oil and metals such as copper onTuesday weighed on commodity-based currencies like theAustralian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars, which had all hitmulti-month highs in early trade, buoyed by the rally in riskyassets. The Australian dollar relinquished gains made after theReserve Bank of Australia left interest rates unchanged asexpected but dropped its easing bias, backing expectations for arate hike by the end of the year.. The Australian dollar was down 0.3 percent from late U.S.trade at $0.8395 after rising to $0.8471 on the Reuters dealingsystem, the highest since late September. "The end of the Aussie bull run will happen when the RBAactually raises rates, as investors take their money off theAussie and on currencies where rates will rise next," said NeilJones, head of European hedge fund sales at Mizuho in London. The New Zealand dollar fell 0.3 percent to $0.6658 afterearlier rising to $0.6712, its highest in 10 months. The U.S.dollar was also up 0.3 percent against the Canadian dollar atC$1.0684. Sterling was steady on the day against the dollar at $1.6935after it touched a new nine-month high of $1.7005 earlier in thesession.
