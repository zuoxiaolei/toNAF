The tepid nature of the rich world's recovery from globalrecession kept investors on the defensive, with a generalflight to relative safe havens prompting a rebound for gold andfalls in U.S. and Japanese government debt yields tomulti-month lows. European shares were also expected to fall, with financialbookmakers forecasting the benchmark indexes in Britain, Franceand Germany to open down 0.8-1.2 percent. Eurostoxx 50 Futures slid 1.7 percent. [.L] Chinese stocks  fell 4 percent to a 14-month low, asinvestors started pulling funds from the market to prepare fora major initial public offering by Agricultural Bank of China,pointing to tight liquidity in China's markets. [.SS] "The market is still facing financing pressures and we arestill worried about the domestic economy," said Zheng Weigang,an analyst at Shanghai Securities. Tokyo's Nikkei  fell 1.3 percent to a three-weekclosing low and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific sharesoutside Japan fell 1.6 percent. The Nikkei has fallen around 14 percent in the secondquarter and the MSCI AP ex-Japan is down roughly 8 percent,putting both on track for their worst quarterly performancesince the meltdown in the final months of 2008 following thecollapse of Lehman Brothers. World stock markets rebounded strongly in 2009, butinvestors are now fretting about the uncertainty of the outlookas governments -- many facing ballooning debt burdens -- startto turn off the stimulus that supported the fledgling recovery. EURO WOES The euro fell around 1 percent against the yen ,dragged down by losses against the Swiss franc. It fell 0.2percent on the day to touch 1.3323 francs  on tradingplatform EBS, the weakest since its launch in 1999. The pair has now lost 4 percent since June 17, when theSwiss central bank backed off from a pledge to fight excessiveappreciation in the franc. Traders in Asia said investors were wary of growth-linkedcurrencies and the euro amid festering problems in the eurozone, where funding pressures re-emerged with interbank lendingrates hitting their highest in almost seven months on Monday. Banks must repay 442 billion euros ($545.5 billion) to theEuropean Central Bank on Thursday, leaving a potentialliquidity shortfall in the financial system of more than 100billion euros. [ID:nLDE65R0LE] The premium investors demand to hold 10-year Italian,French and Spanish government bonds, rather than euro zonebenchmark German Bunds, all widened. "Renewed debt stress stories...have weighed a bit on theeuro and led to renewed safe-haven parking in the yen and Swissfranc," said dealer at a Swiss bank. "Investors' sentiment towards peripheral Europe remainscautious and fragile to say the least." The search for safer assets pushed the U.S. benchmark10-year yield  to its lowest since April 2009, whilethe benchmark Japanese Government Bond 10-year yield fell to a seven-year low. [JP/] [US/T] Concerns about Europe's debt burden contributed to arebound for gold , with spot prices for the safe-havenmetal rising more than $3 to $1,239.20 an ounce. [GOL/] "Gold is likely to remain pretty well supported in thecurrent quarter. Safe-haven demand for gold remains prominent,"said David Moore, a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bankof Australia in Sydney. The euro's weakness -- and consequent relative dollarstrength -- also contributed to falling in oil prices, makingdollar-denominated crude more expensive for buyers in Europeand Asia. Oil  fell nearly 1 percent to $77.53 a barrel, asforecasts indicated Tropical Storm Alex was likely to skirt themain production region in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. [O/R] "Markets are concerned that European banks are pressed topay 442 billion euros. If these worries sustain and the eurofalls, a stronger dollar would pressure oil prices down," saidSerene Lim, a Singapore-based oil analyst at ANZ Bank.
