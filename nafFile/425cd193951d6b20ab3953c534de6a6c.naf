<raw><![CDATA[ * G20 should focus on development and poverty reduction * Fixing exchange rate policies not sufficient * No agreement on framework for growth at Toronto summit * Big changes are for medium and long term By Louise Egan OTTAWA, April 7 (Reuters) - The G20 should agree to scrapfarm subsidies in advanced economies and take other steps tobridge the rich-poor divide, a senior Argentine official saidon Tuesday, but he said there was no consensus yet within thegroup on policy reforms. It would be premature to expect any big agreements at theGroup of 20 summit in Toronto on June 26-27, said NestorStancanelli, Argentina's G20 sherpa, or representative, anddeputy secretary of international economic negotiations. "No, I don't believe there is a consensus yet. We're indialogue and discussion," he told Reuters in an interview. The G20 developing and advanced economies agreed last yearto work on a new framework for economic growth to avoid areturn to the kind of imbalances in the global economy thatresult in such things as the United States running a hugedeficit paid for by surpluses in Asia. The plan is to draw upa set of complementary policies and implement them.[ID:nL7199828]  G20 sherpas met in Ottawa in mid-March to prepare for theJune leaders' meeting hosted by Canada. Much of the reform talk has focused on fixing the banks andpressing China to have a more flexible currency. But somedeveloping economies want to see more of an emphasis onpolicies for promoting development and redistributing income,which require changes to agriculture subsidies and bankregulations, Stancanelli said. "In some cases, there are suggestions that a correction inthe exchange rates of some currencies would be sufficient butthat is just part of a much more complex picture," he said. World leaders agreed last year to designate the G20 as theprimary forum for global economic matters, replacing theexclusive G7 club of industrialized countries. But it remainsto be seen whether the larger, more diverse group can unitebehind an action plan. There is common ground on the need for better financialregulations and reduced fiscal deficits, among other things.But a potential rift on other issues could delay reforms. Stancanelli said the European Union, Japan and othersshould amend their agriculture policies to end subsidies andallow the poorest nations duty-free access to their markets. "If there is no solution to these problems that I mention-- the distortions and protectionism -- it's evident that wewill continue to be in crisis," he said. Stancanelli said he was surprised that a letter sent lastweek by five leaders to their fellow G20 members did notmention the issue of development. "It's a substantial issue,"he said. [ID:nTOE62T046] He also suggested rules for the banking sector should goabove and beyond ensuring they are well capitalized. "Since governments rescued their financial institutions,then undoubtedly now there should be regulations so that thesector channels its savings to the productive and socialsectors. That implies a change and they won't be as profitableas before," he said. When asked if other G20 members shared Argentina'sdiagnosis of the ills that needed fixing, Stancanelli said hehad held discussions with Brazil and South Africa and "the viewis quite similar". He expressed confidence in an eventual consensus. "We're talking about very complex changes in the medium andlong term. These are not issues that are going to be solved atthe next summit, but we need to show that we're heading in theright direction."
