<raw><![CDATA[(Corrects item from Thursday to show figure in 2nd paragraphrefers to public debt only) * Emerging debt crises show possible upside of restructuring * Debt exchange an option but bank support required * Voluntary rollover akin to Vienna Initiative possible    By Sebastian Tong LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - As speculation about a Greekrestructuring intensifies, investors could do worse than to lookat how emerging economies have faced down debt crises. With some 300 billion euros ($428.3 billion) in outstandingpublic debt, a Greek workout would be unprecedented. But pastcredit crises suggest that restructuring, in tandem withsufficiently rigorous fiscal reform, could draw a decisive lineunder Greece's economic woes. Still, successful emerging-market restructurings may not beeasily replicated in Greece. "One lesson from emerging markets is that if debtrestructuring is unavoidable, it's better to do it sooner thanlater," said Athanasios Vamvakidis, European Head G10 FXStrategy at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. "But in the case of significant contagion risks and largecontingent liabilities from the financial sector, it may bebetter to wait," he added.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Euro debt woes package: http://r.reuters.com/hyb65p Graphic on bank exposure: http://r.reuters.com/vyj98r Euro crisis timeline: http://link.reuters.com/xur78r^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ A year after securing a 110 billion-euro bailout from theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and its European partners,Greece remains mired in recession and is missing fiscal targetsset for its rescue. Investors rule out an outright default but many think Greeceshould seek to renegotiate debt that is expected to hit 160percent of gross domestic product next year.   BRADY CRUNCH Wide-ranging voluntary restructuring programmes such as theBrady Plan could ostensibly be a template for a solution forGreece and other indebted euro zone members such as Portugal. Launched in 1989 to help mostly Latin American countriesbreak out of a vicious circle of crippling debt costs and severecontraction, the Brady Plan allowed creditors to swap defaultedbank loans for a choice of new bonds, usually collateralised byU.S. Treasury bonds. In the Greek case, the EU could offer to exchange sovereignbonds for new debt issued by its collective bailout vehicle --the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) or from mid-2013,the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Even if the terms entice enough creditors, the restructuringmay not be sufficient to help drive a Greek recovery. Over half the 17 debtor countries that took part in the Bradyprogramme between 1989 and 1997 are now investment grade butmost of these are major commodity exporters that took at least adecade before attaining that credit status. Greece's diverse investor base poses another hurdle. "Greek debt is spread amongst a high number of investorscompared with emerging markets where you could negotiate withthe largest holders," said Kommer van Tright, portfolio managerat Dutch firm Robeco. Ironically, the presence of the EU as a backstop offerscreditors little incentive to take part in a restructuring. "An incentive to take part in the Brady Plan was that itregularised payments on debt that many developing economies hadsimply stopped servicing," said Phil Poole, HSBC Global AssetManagement's global head of macro and investment strategy.  VIENNA CALLING Should enough creditors be persuaded to take part in arestructuring, the EU would also have to avoid fanning marketfears over debt issued by peripheral euro zone countries, alreadyheightened after EU-led bailouts for Ireland and Portugal. Emerging markets have long laboured under the shadow ofcontagion risk: Mexico's declaration in 1982 that it could nolonger service its foreign loans triggered a wider debt crisisfor Latin America while the collapse of the Thai baht in 1997sent Asia into a tailspin.  But the size of Greek debt together with the country'sinclusion in the euro zone imply contagion from a Greek creditevent would surpass anything previously seen. Any restructuring that includes a "haircut" or forced losseson the principal would hit bondholders that include Europeanbanks and pension funds as well as the European Central Bank. Euro zone banks hold around 154 billion euros of Greek debt,according to data from Bank for International Settlements. If restructuring is initiated, the EU would have to providesome form of guarantee on euro zone bank deposits to prevent therun on banks seen in Argentina in 2001 when its attempt toexchange distressed debt ended in the largest ever sovereigndefault at over $90 billion. Even if policymakers are willing to pay the price, Greece'sinclusion in the single currency imply a debt workout would nothave the same impact on growth as it has for emerging economies. "In emerging economies, restructuring took place withexchange rate collapse and this helped the countries regaincompetitiveness. Devaluation is not an option for Greece," saidVamvakidis, who worked at the IMF from 1997 to 2010. For the moment, a solution to the Greek quandary could comefrom the emerging economies within Europe itself. At the height of the global financial crisis, EUpolicymakers moved to dissuade Western European banks from alarge-scale and uncoordinated pull-out from eastern Europe underthe so-called Vienna Initiative. "What cannot be excluded...is a 'voluntary' roll-over ofoutstanding Greek debt...in line with the 'Vienna Initiative',said Deutsche Bank in a note.
