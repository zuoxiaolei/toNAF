<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The euro extended gains against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, rising to a four day high ahead of testimony by Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke before the Budget Committee in Washington.EUR/USD hit 1.3718 during European late afternoon trade, the pair’s highest since February 3; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3704, up 0.59%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.3571, Tuesday’s low and resistance at 1.3824, the high of February 3.Earlier in the day, the euro dipped following reports that German central bank head Axel Weber won’t succeed Jean-Claude Trichet as president of the European Central Bank when his contract expires in late October.Weber, considered to be one of the most hawkish members of the ECB's governing council, has been seen as a frontrunner to succeed Mr. Trichet later this year. The euro's rally this year has been driven by expectations that the ECB will start its tightening cycle sooner than other major economies.The euro was also higher against the pound, with EUR/GBP rising 0.4% to hit 0.8513.Also Wednesday, official data showed that German exports were up for a second month in December as demand for goods from the euro zone’s largest economy improved.The Federal Statistics Office said exports rose 0.5% from November, when they also rose 0.5%. Imports dropped 2.3% from November, when they jumped 4.1%.The total trade surplus rose more-than-expected in December, increasing to EUR14.0 billion, up from EUR11.8 billion in November.             ]]></raw>
