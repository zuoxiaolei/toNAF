The market refocused on risk-taking in the wake ofstronger-than-expected U.S. existing home sales data on Friday,upbeat comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke andMonday's data showing firmer industrial orders in the eurozone. The low-yielding yen tends to fall against high-yieldingcurrencies when equities rise or data strengthens hopes for arecovery in the global economy, which bodes well for commodityproducers. But the dollar, which also usually declines when risksentiment picks up, held its ground against major currenciessuch as the euro and sterling. "Across the board, risk trades are a little bit moreattractive and we're seeing a weaker yen and a stronger Aussieand Kiwi," said John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange atING Capital Markets in New York. "But I wouldn't read too much into it. Volumes are thin andwe still have a few weeks of summer trading. The dollar,overall, is still locked in a range." In midday New York trading, the dollar was up 0.4 percentagainst the yen at 94.74 yen , after briefly hitting aone-week high of 95.06 yen, according to Reuters data. The euro was up 0.3 percent at 135.62 yen  butwas flat on the day versus the dollar at $1.4317 . The euro trimmed losses against the greenback after eurozone industrial orders came in much higher than expected. Eurozone industrial orders rose 3.1 percent in June from theprevious month, beating forecasts of a 1.5 percent gain.[ID:nBRQ007483].

Against the euro, sterling fell to an 11-weeklow, with the euro hitting a high around 87.27 pence ,according to Reuters data. Traders said investors took out a key options barrier at 87pence in euro/sterling, precipitating further gains in thepair.
