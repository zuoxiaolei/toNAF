<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds details) WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obamawill press China on its currency policy during his upcomingmeetings in Washington with Chinese President Hu Jintao, theWhite House said on Wednesday. "China plays an enormously important role in our globaleconomy and China has to take steps to rebalance its currency,and the president will continue to make that point whenPresident Hu is here," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs tolda news briefing. Hu visits the White House on Jan. 19. Economic issues are the single biggest source of tensionbetween the world's two largest economies. Facing a trade deficit with China up 20 percent in thefirst 10 months of 2010, Washington complains that Beijingkeeps its yuan currency too low, giving it an unfairadvantage, and Obama has repeatedly warned China againstrelying too much on exports for growth. Chinese officials say U.S. easy-money policy is aimed atweakening the dollar to boost exports, and have said yuanappreciation would have little impact on reducing the tradesurplus, which is expected to hit $270 billion for 2010. Some members of the U.S. Senate have even pushed for a lawto punish Beijing if it does not revalue the yuan. Human rights, the global economy, the Chinese currency andthe situation in North Korea are among items on the list ofissues the two leaders will discuss, Gibbs said.(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle, Editing by Sandra Maler)             ]]></raw>
