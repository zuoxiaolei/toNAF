<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro down, market unconvinced by parts of Greek aid plan* Dollar rallies vs yen, helped by strong ISM report * Aussie hit by China tightening but recovers ground (Adds details, updates prices) By Steven C. Johnson and Vivianne Rodrigues NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against theeuro and yen on Monday on growth in U.S. manufacturing anddoubts about Greece's ability to honor a pledge for drasticwage cuts in return for an aid package. After rising in Asian trade, the euro shed more than 1percent, falling beneath $1.32 as markets worried whetherGreece could make 30 billion euros of wage cuts and tax hikesin exchange for a 110 billion euro ($147 billion) emergency aidpackage. Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief that an agreement wasreached and a safe-haven bid for U.S. Treasuries faded. Butcurrency traders worried whether Germany would secureparliamentary approval to release the money. Greece needs fundsby May 19 to meet a big repayment to creditors.

This time though, that was definitely not the case,"said Dan Cook, a senior market analyst at IG Markets Inc, inChicago." "Investors were subject to a bit of 'sticker shock' whenthe 110 billion euro price tag was revealed," he added. "Thathefty sum also carries with it some strict conditions that manyquestion whether Greece will be able to comply with." In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro fell 0.7percent to $1.3195  after rising above $1.33 earlier.Traders said downside support was seen at the one-year lowaround $1.3112 touched last week. Market holidays in Tokyo and London kept trading volume abit lighter than usual, and some traders said that exaggeratedthe scope of the moves a bit. But investors remain heavily short the euro, as Commodityand Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday, andsentiment remains bearish.[IMM/FX] "I wouldn't be surprised to see (the euro) below $1.30 inthe next three months," said Jacob Oubina, a strategist atForex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. Currency analysts at UBS AG said in a note investors shouldlook to sell into any euro strength over the next few days, andthe euro/dollar may hit 1.30 in the medium term. The dollar hit an 8-1/2-month high against the yen earlieras U.S. manufacturing data boosted optimism about the economicrecovery. The dollar rose to 94.80 yen , according to Reutersdata, its highest level since Aug. 24, and was last changinghands at 94.61 yen, up 0.8 percent on the day. [ID:nN03189741] STRONG DATA Strong U.S. data has reinforced expectations the FederalReserve will raise interest rates later this year, while theBank of Japan is seen keeping rates low indefinitely. The move "encourages speculation that the Federal Reservecould move its time frame forward for tightening monetarypolicy while the Bank of Japan is likely to remain on hold forthe foreseeable future," said Michael Malpede, analyst at EasyForex in Chicago, making a higher-yielding dollar moreattractive than the yen to global investors. The Australian dollar rose 0.2 percent to $0.9264 ,recovering losses suffered after China's central bank said itwas lifting lenders' reserve requirement ratio by 50 basispoints, its third hike of that magnitude this year.[ID:nSGE64200J] Even with Greece securing aid, investors said there werestill concerns about other indebted euro zone countries such asPortugal and Spain. To ease concerns, the European Central Bank on Mondaysuspended collateral rules for Greek government debt and saidit would continue to accept the bonds regardless of thecountry's credit rating. [ID:nLDE6420A9] S&P cut Greece's rating to junk status last week. Accordingto previous rules, if the two other major ratings agencies wereto follow suit, banks wishing to use Greek debt as collateralfor ECB loans would have had to take a significant haircut.
