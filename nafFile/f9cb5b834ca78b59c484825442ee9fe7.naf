<raw><![CDATA[ * EU, IMF agree $1 trilion crisis fund to fend offcontagion * Euro jumps 1.7 pct, still faces uphill battle * Asia stocks up 3.1 pct but eye Europe, U.S. marketreaction * Big central banks offer liquidity support to ease strains * Markets want more details on aid, long-term worriesremain By Umesh Desai HONG KONG, May 10 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded from14-month lows and Asian stocks jumped on Monday after theEuropean Union and IMF carved out an emergency rescue packageof up to 750 billion euros ($1 trillion) to keep Greece's debtcrisis from spreading through the euro zone. The size of the package and an unexpected pledge by theEuropean Central Bank to buy euro zone bonds if needed gaveinvestors some confidence to return to riskier assets such asstocks, though questions remained about how the scheme wouldwork. [ID:nN09270819] Major global central banks moved swiftly to support Europe,re-establishing dollar swap facilities used during the2007-2008 financial crisis to help ease strains and ensurethere was enough liquidity to keep global credit markets fromseizing up again. "These measures are a game changer in the near to mediumterm," said Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief investment strategist forSJS  Markets, adding the aid package was big enough to deterspeculation in the short term about a Greek debt default. Others agreed the move had at least bought Europe some timeas it tries to calm markets, but High Frequency Economics saidin a research note that the package was "still too vague tounderstand". The euro rose to as high as $1.2982  bymid-afternoon, up around 1.7 percent and pulling away from a14-month low of $1.2510 hit on trading platform EBS last week. European and U.S. stocks were also seen opening higher. Britain's FTSE 100 , Germany's DAX  andFrance's CAC 40  was seen up as much as 2.8 percent,according to financial bookmakers. S&P futures  rosenearly 3 percent. But gains in Asia were tempered by caution about how theemergency package will be funded and concerns about longer termstructural problems in the euro zone. The MSCI ex-Japan index  rose 3.1 percent,while Japan's Nikkei  ended up 1.6 percent but off theday's high. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index fell for five straight dayslast week for a loss of 8.4 percent, wiping out its gains sofar this year and its highest percentage weekly loss sinceNovember 2008. "Investors now want to see how European and U.S. stocksperform overnight. Caution also remains as reasons behind theabnormal slide in U.S. stocks last week still haven't beenidentified," said Kazuhiro Takahashi, general manager at DaiwaSecurities Capital Markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  suffered a so farunexplained plunge of nearly 1,000 points at one point onThursday as Greece's debt problems intensified. Though Wall Street later recouped most of the sharp losses,with traders initially suspecting a technical glitch,investors' nerves remain frayed by the extreme volatility inrecent days. Kowalczyk said global risky assets --  equities,commodities and emerging market assets -- would be boosted bythe latest EU support measures but added the euro will soonslip again because of the liquidity boost provided by ECB. The ECB surprised analysts by saying it will buy euro zonegovernment bonds to help support fractured markets, abandoningits resistance to full-scale asset purchases. [ID:nLDE64901W] While some analysts had urged the central bank to push sucha financial "nuclear button" to defuse the escalating debtcrisis, others said buying bonds could be tantamount toprinting money to finance Greece's fiscal deficit.[ID:nSGE649024] Before the European announcement, data from the CommodityFutures Trading Commission showed euro sceptics' bets againstthe common currency hit a record high in the week ending May 4.[IMM/FX] Financial markets have been punishing heavily indebted eurozone members, threatening to plunge them into the same sort ofcrisis as Greece, which could derail the global economicrecovery. The new safety net was meant to protect other countrieswith bloated budgets, such as Portugal, Spain and Ireland. As jitters over euro zone finances battered global markets,investors have dumped riskier assets for safer ones such as theU.S. dollar, creating fears of dollar shortages in somecountries and driving up dollar funding costs. "While the ECB's intervention (in bond markets) mightattract bad press regarding its mandate and independence, webelieve that this was necessary to short circuit the negativefeedback loop which was getting more and more threatening forthe global economy," the Royal Bank of Scotland said in aresearch note. "Sceptics will probably argue that this does not solve themedium term debt overhang issues plaguing the periphery (otherweak euro zone countries). However they won't deny that thiswill give them a chance to implement some fiscal consolidationplans to restore market confidence in the sustainability ofpublic finances in the euro area." Oil  rose 3 percent to above $77 a barrel on hopesthat the EU deal will prevent broader damage to Europe'seconomy which would have dampened energy demand. Gold  tumbled as much as 1.5 percent to $1,195.20 anaounce, down from a near record-high of $1,213.35 hit Friday. The U.S. dollar was firmer against the yen at 92.64 and well off Friday's five-month lows of 88.00. It was down 1percent against a basket of major world currencies . U.S. Treasuries <0#USBMK=> were broadly weaker amidoptimism about the plan, adding to Friday's losses after theU.S. Labor Dept reported larger-than-expected employment gainsin April, suggesting the economic recovery was well underway.
