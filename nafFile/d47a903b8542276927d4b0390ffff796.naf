<raw><![CDATA[ * Greenback stays defensive after Friday's U.S. jobs data * Market players wary before FOMC on Tuesday * Euro near 3-mth peak vs dollar; Yen near 15-yr highs (Adds quote, updates prices, changes byline, changes dateline,previous LONDON) By Wanfeng Zhou NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher againstmajor currencies on Monday, coming off Friday's lows as waryinvestors lightened positions ahead of a Federal Reserveinterest rate announcement. But the dollar stayed on the defensive, as disappointingU.S. jobs data on Friday highlighted a weakening U.S. economicoutlook and added to speculation about further monetaryeasing. Market players refrained from chasing prices aggressively,having already priced in some form of modest easing at theFederal Reserve's policy meeting on Tuesday. This kept majorcurrencies within fairly tight ranges. "Investors are likely to consolidate positions ahead oftomorrow afternoon's FOMC policy meeting," said Omer Esiner,chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange inWashington. "While some risk of new policy action is already pricedinto the greenback's valuation, more stimulus would make adollar recovery difficult in the near-term." In early New York trading, the euro fell 0.3 percent to$1.3246, not far from a three-month peak of $1.3334 struck onelectronic trading platform EBS on Friday.  The euro added to losses after it failed to hold above the$1.33 level and stops were triggered at $1.3250 and $1.3240,traders said. The dollar's general weakness could keep the euro buoyantin the near term, but profit-taking is expected to increase asthe euro approaches the psychologically key $1.3500 level. That level almost coincides with a 50 percent retracementof the single European currency's fall from a November peak of$1.5145 to a four-year trough of $1.1876 hit in June. Traders also kept a close eye on the yen, which rose to85.02 yen versus the dollar on trading platform EBS on Friday,just shy of a 15-year peak of 84.82 yen hit last November. The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 85.68 yen. There were substantial automatic "stop loss" trades thatwould be triggered just under option barriers at 85.00 yen,potentially triggering a slide further, traders said. Morestops were sitting below 84.82 yen, with option barriers at84.75 yen seen rolling off later in the week, they said. SHORT DOLLAR POSITIONS Data showed currency speculators increased bets against theU.S. dollar in the latest week and increased their net yen longpositions to the highest level since December.  The dollar edged up 0.3 percent against a basket ofcurrencies to 80.621. Support was seen at the April low of80.031 and then the March trough of 79.507, traders said. "It would be a shock were the Fed to go beyond stating thatit will re-invest maturing mortgage-based securities,preventing its $2.3 trillion balance sheet from shrinking,"said Tom Levinson, currency strategist at ING. "A downgrading of its economic and inflation assessment maybe considered a potential precursor to renewed action in comingmonths should things not start to improve," he added. Data on Friday showed that overall U.S. non-farm payrollsfell 131,000 in July, while private employment, a better gaugeof labor market health, rose a modest 71,000, below forecastsfor a gain of 90,000. By contrast, data on Monday suggested the euro zone was inbetter shape. Euro zone investor morale surged while Germanexports rose more than forecast.
