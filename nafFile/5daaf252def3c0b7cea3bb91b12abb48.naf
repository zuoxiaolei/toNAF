<raw><![CDATA[ * BOJ should set inflation target - aide to Ozawa * Need to include Asian currencies in FX reserves - aide (Adds comment, background) By Yoko Nishikawa TOKYO, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan (BOJ) shouldexpand its outright buying of long-term Japanese governmentbonds (JGB) to help beat deflation, an aide to the ruling partypowerbroker challenging Prime Minister Naoto Kan said onFriday. Tsutomu Okubo, who is helping to form economic policies forthe challenger, Ichiro Ozawa, also said Japan should considerways, such as setting up currency swap agreements, to diversifyits massive foreign reserves and include Asian currencies tomatch its trade weightings. Ozawa is challenging Kan in the Democratic Party'sleadership vote on Sept. 14 that underscores a rift over fiscalpriorities as Japan confronts a strong yen and weak economy. The race is still too close to call but whoever wins willface a raft of policy challenges and a divided parliament thatthreatens more policy deadlock. "The BOJ's balance sheet has been shrinking by around 25percent since its peak in 2005, effectively tightening monetarypolicy," Okubo told Reuters in an interview. "It shouldincrease its outright buying of long-term government bonds." Okubo said the BOJ should review its self-imposed rule thatthe balance of JGBs it holds should not exceed the amount ofbank notes in circulation. The BOJ has consistently defended this rule to avoid theperception that it is directly underwriting government debt. The BOJ currently buys 21.6 trillion yen ($260 billion) oflong-term government bonds outright from the market each year. While noting that his recommendations have not beenauthorised by Ozawa, Okubo said the BOJ and the governmentshould set an accord to share policy goals to show resolve toovercome deflation, including setting an inflation target. ASIAN CURRENCIES IN FX RESERVES The BOJ held its easy monetary policy unchanged this weekafter bowing to government pressure to expand its fund supplytool at an emergency meeting last month. It says the currentamount of its government bond purchases is appropriate. Ozawa has said that, given Japan's low interest rates,there is limited room for the BOJ to fix the yen's rise to a15-year high against the dollar. He has urged authorities toconsider currency intervention to stem the yen's strength. Okubo did not rule out such intervention. But he said theBOJ data, which he obtained, showed the current dollar exchangerate of about 84 yen would be equivalent to 123 yen in 1995,when the dollar fell to a record high of 79.75 yen, as Japan'sprices fell by an annualised rate of 0.1 percent over the past15 years. "The problem is what has the BOJ been doing over the past15 years, leaving deflation alone." Okubo, a former investment banker, said Japan shouldnegotiate with China on allowing Japanese purchases of Chinesebonds, which he said could help curb the yen's surge. "We should shift the component of our foreign reserves inline with our trade weightings. For that, we should increaseAsian currencies," he said, adding that managing high-yieldingAsian currency-denominated securities could also boost interestrate income on foreign assets in the reserves. He added that some dollar assets in the reserves could alsobe used to help dollar financing of Japanese firms that areseeking to invest in foreign resources via the Japan Bank forInternational Cooperation, a government-backed agency. Tokyo does not give a currency breakdown of its $1 trillionforeign reserves, but historical data on currency interventionshows most of them are held in dollars and some are in euros.
