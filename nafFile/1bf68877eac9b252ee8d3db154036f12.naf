<raw><![CDATA[ * BoE votes 7-1 for 0.5 pct, Sentance urges 25 bps rise * MPC considers "modest easing" as well as tightening * Growth outlook weakened over past month * Sterling falls, gilt futures rally on dovish tone  (Adds detail, reaction) By David Milliken and Christina Fincher LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - Bank of England rate-settersdiscussed easing monetary policy for the first time sinceFebruary, minutes of their July 7-8 meeting showed on Wednesday,reflecting growing concerns about Britain's economic prospects. The Monetary Policy Committee's first meeting sinceBritain's austere emergency budget last month produced theexpected 7-1 split in favour of keeping rates at a record low0.5 percent, as lone hawk Andrew Sentance maintained his callfor a 0.25 percentage point rise in rates. More of a surprise to economists was the MPC's downbeat toneon growth, and the fact that arguments for a "modest easing" inmonetary policy -- in practice, an increase to the 200 billionpounds of quantitative easing already pumped into the economy --were discussed alongside the case for a "modest tightening". "Clearly we have Sentance at one end of the spectrum butthere's a broad range of views on the committee. But now theyare clearly concerned about developments in the global economyand particularly the downside risks," said UBS analyst AmitKara. The MPC faces a dilemma. British inflation is still wellabove its 2 percent target after hitting a 17-month high of 3.7percent in April. But the nascent economic recovery looksincreasingly fragile as fiscal austerity becomes the watchwordacross much of Europe. Before the minutes were released, most economists had notexpected the BoE to raise rates before early next year, yetneither did many see a revival in the quantitative easingprogramme that was paused in February. So sterling  fell and gilt futures  turnedpositive on the news, as investors sensed policy tighteningcould be even further off than they thought. "The voting arithmetic may indicate that a `hawkish' biaspersists within the MPC but our interpretation of the Julyminutes is that there has been a dovish shift in the balance ofopinion," said RBS economist Ross Walker. "The `hawkish' contingent will be capped at two members andthe underlying risks will shift in a dovish direction. ByNovember, a three-way split is more likely than not."  DOWNBEAT ON GROWTH The minutes were noticeably more downbeat on growth, sayingprospects had worsened over the month, possibly into the mediumterm. Forward-looking business survey indicators in Britain andoverseas had weakened, and pressure in bank funding marketsmeant the availability of credit to firms and households was notimproving as much as before, MPC members said. Finance minister George Osborne's June 22 budget -- whichpencils in 25 percent cuts to most departmental spending --would probably slightly reduce growth, but averted the risk thata sharp spike in gilt yields could derail the recovery. However, near-term inflation prospects had also worsened andconsumer price inflation was likely to be higher in the rest of2010 than envisaged in the May inflation report. "In the light of the news over the month, it seemed likelythat growth would be weaker than previously expected but, atleast for a while, inflation was likely to be higher," theminutes said. MPC member Adam Posen said in a Dow Jones interviewpublished late on Tuesday that monetary policy could move eitherway, and the June budget would not make a significant differenceto updated BoE forecasts due next month [ID:nLDE66J20C]. In the minutes, policymakers acknowledged the risk thatpersistently above-target prices rises could raise households'inflation expectations, but said there was little evidence ofthis happening so far, with wage growth remaining subdued. Most members were happy on balance to leave the stanceunchanged, confident that spare capacity in the economy wouldbring inflation back to target in the medium term once theeffect of temporary factors had worn off. Sentance said that a return to growth and a rebound ininflation meant the time for a rate rise was now. (editing by John Stonestreet)             ]]></raw>
