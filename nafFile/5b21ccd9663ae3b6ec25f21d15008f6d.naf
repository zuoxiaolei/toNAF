<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro eases from 4-1/2-month high versus dollar * Portugal's parliament says 'No' to austerity budget * Sterling falls after UK growth forecast (Adds details, updates prices) NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Wednesday,hurt by fears debt-ridden Portugal will require a bailout afterits parliament rejected the minority government's austeritymeasures. The vote is likely to cause the government's collapse. Prime Minister Jose Socrates has said he will resign if theplan fails to clear parliament and Portugal would probably beforced to seek foreign aid. Socrates is to meet President Anibal Cavaco Silva laterWednesday. For more, see: [ID:nLIS002609]. The euro extended declines on the news and fell to asession low, although it recovered as investors debated howmuch of the news was already priced in. "This raises the likelihood that Portugal will require abailout, but the question is about how much the market hasalready factored this in," said Brian Dolan, chief strategistat Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. "I'd say it's beenfactored in to a significant degree, given the run-up we'veseen in Portuguese yields and CDS." Earlier, an International Monetary Fund spokeswoman saidPortugal had not requested a loan program backed by theinstitution, dismissing speculation Lisbon was in talks withthe fund. The euro  was last down 0.6 percent at $1.4105after hitting a low for the session of $1.4099, according totrading platform EBS. "The euro is holding up pretty well," Dolan said. "Thefeeling is the periphery is covered by the bailout fund and thecore is in good shape." Dolan suggested euro/dollar will still test $1.44-45 in theshort run. Most investors are betting any losses in the singlecurrency should be limited amid expectations of rising eurozone interest rates. The euro was already down from a 4-1/2-month high againstthe dollar, set in the previous session, ahead of thePortuguese vote, after failing to break through optionsbarriers in the $1.4250 area. Analysts said the euro could dipbelow $1.40 in the short term before rising toward $1.4280, theNovember high. Adding to bearish euro sentiment was a document showingEuropean leaders will decide how to increase their bailout fundonly in June, not this week. [ID:nBRU011391] The yield on Irish government bonds soared to euro-lifetimehighs on uncertainty over whether a European summit later thisweek will agree on an improvement of the terms on bailoutloans. [ID:nLDE72M0V0] Sterling was last down 0.8 percent to $1.6242 . Ittouched the day's low as Britain lowered its growth projectionsfor the coming year and increased borrowing targets.[ID:nLDE72M01C] DOWNSIDE LIMITED The prospect of higher interest rates, combined with asense that European policymakers have the will to resolve thedebt crisis, was expected to keep the euro supported around$1.40, analysts said. "Economically, the euro zone is showing clear signs ofrecovery, politically the politicians are heading in the rightdirection and expectations of the ECB raising rates favors theeuro over the U.S. dollar," said Thanos Papasavvas, head ofcurrency management at Investec Asset Management, which managesover $10 billion in currency funds. "We hold an overweight position in the euro and will belooking to buy on any dips if the euro corrects," he added.   The dollar was down 0.1 percent against the yen at 80.85, with markets still wary of intervention by authoritiesto curb yen strength. A fall below the 80 to 80.50 area couldsee officials return to the market to sell the Japanesecurrency.
