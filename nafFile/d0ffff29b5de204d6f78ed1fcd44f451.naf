<raw><![CDATA[  (Adds background, analyst comment) WASHINGTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - China's decision to slappreliminary duties on a U.S. specialty steel product does notappear justified, Washington trade officials said on Thursday. "It is unfortunate that China decided to impose provisionalcountervailing duties on imports of grain-oriented electricalsteel (GOES) from the United States," said Carol Guthrie, aspokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office. "We do not believe that the imports in question aresubsidized, nor do we believe that those imports have harmedthe Chinese GOES industry," she said. China announced on Thursday that it will imposeanti-dumping duties of up 25 percent on imports of thespecialty steel from the United States and Russia. It also set additional duties of around 12.0 percent onU.S. steel to offset alleged subsidies. The action follows a number of U.S. steel industry tradecases against China that have prompted Beijing to accuse theUnited States of protectionism. "While the tonnage involved in this trade suit -- 75,000tons, or less than a tenth of a percentage point of the Chinesemarket -- is truly trivial, this decision is anything but,"said Michelle Applebaum of Steel Market Intelligence inChicago. "This trade case reflects an effort by Beijing to stem asurging tide of Western complaints about China's high cost andsubsidized steel industry's exports," she said.
