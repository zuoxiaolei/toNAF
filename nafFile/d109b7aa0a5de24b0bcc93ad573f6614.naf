<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro at 4-mth high vs USD, yen on ECB rate rise view * Dollar on back foot, investors await U.S. payrolls * Analysts: UST yields need to rise on data to boost USD  By Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - The euro hit a four-month highagainst the dollar on Friday on expectations euro zone interestrates may rise next month, while investors waited to see whetherstrong U.S. jobs data would offer the greenback some respite. The central forecast in a Reuters poll was for 185,000 newjobs to have been added to the economy last month, after anaddition of 36,000 in January.   With the euro hovering just shy of $1.40, analysts looked tomovements in U.S. yields to drive the dollar after the jobsdata, due at 1330 GMT.  "We should see a better non-farm payrolls figure, but ifU.S. yields don't rise, it won't help the dollar," said MarcusHettinger, global FX strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich. "Interest rate differentials ... are playing in favour forthe euro, so we could see a break above $1.40 any time now." The euro stayed well bid after European Central BankPresident Jean-Claude Trichet stunned investors on Thursday bysaying a rate rise in April was a possibility. [ID:nLDE7220KJ] The euro  edged up to $1.3978 on trading platform EBS,its strongest level since early November. Gains were capped,however, with traders citing a barrier at $1.40 and offers tosell the single currency looming just above there. Analysts said the euro was poised for a move higher, though,as the ECB's announcement, which fortified the view the ECB willraise rates well before the Federal Reserve, had widened the gapbetween euro zone and U.S. government bond yields. At the same time, Paul Robinson, head of European FXResearch at Barclays Capital, said dollar risks were skewed tothe downside heading into payrolls and that the U.S. currencycould face more selling than usual if the figure comes in weak. "What makes today's nonfarm payrolls data more interestingis the very different views of the world held by the ECB andFederal Reserve," he said.  ECB rate speculation has pushed yields on two-year Germangovernment bonds  -- the maturity most sensitive toofficial rate moves -- roughly a full percentage point higherthan those of their U.S. counterparts  this week. Thespread between the two is now at its widest since January 2009. Euro interest rate swaps soared across the curve with thetwo-year rate  hitting around 2.33 percent, highsnot seen since early 2009. While rate speculation has boosted the euro, some analystspointed out the dangers of tightening policy when some euro zoneeconomies are suffering because of debt problems. The euro had support above its 200-week moving averagearound $1.3957, and a weekly close above that would pave the wayfor a move higher. Near-term resistance was seen around $1.3980,however, the 78.6 percent retracement of the euro's down-movefrom November. The euro also hit a five-month high against the yen of 115.55 yen, according to Reuters data. BUY ON DIPS Market participants acknowledged the euro may stumble ifEuropean officials fail to reach a consensus on a lastingsolution to euro zone debt problems when they meet this month. But some forex managers said they would be happy to pick upthe single currency if it dips on such concerns, as they wereconfident political differences within the region were unlikelyto derail overall stability. "We like the euro," said Thanos Papasavvas, head of currencymanagement at Investec, arguing that even the economies of someweaker euro zone countries were starting to improve, whileEurope would eventually hammer out a permanent debt rescue plan. He added: "We would be interested in increasing our europositions more on any correction to $1.34-35." But the shared currency  slipped 0.3 percent onthe day to 1.2967 Swiss francs, which rallied after SwissNational Bank Vice Chairman Thomas Jordan said rates in thecountry will have to rise in the medium term. [ID:nWEB3522] The dollar  was up 0.3 percent at 82.69 yen, but wasat 76.493 against a currency basket , little changed onthe day and hovering near a four-month low hit on Thursday.
