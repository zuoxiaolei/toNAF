The dollar later trimmed losses as the yen was unable tobreak through key resistance. But the U.S. currency lost outagainst most of its rivals, with traders taking bets on animproving global economy by buying commodity-linked currencies. The yen rallied to 88.01 yen, according to trading platformEBS, its highest since late January. "I suspect the market wants to see how far it can push thenew Japanese administration who have been sending mixed messageson its attitude towards yen strength," said Daragh Maher, deputyhead of forex strategy at Calyon. By 1106 GMT, the dollar had fallen 0.8 percent against theyen to hit its lowest level since late January, before clawingback to trade at 88.65 yen, unchanged on the day. The yen's inability to appreciate beyond 88.00 yen, wheremargin calls and options barriers lurked, had prompted arecovery in the U.S. currency. A sustained fall under that levelwas seen opening the door to a slide to 87.10 yen, a level hitin January for the first time since mid-1995. Sterling  fell as much as 1 percent to 139.74 yen,approaching a 5 1/2-month low.

Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said on Wednesdayhe was quietly watching currency moves for now, but addedauthorities may take some steps if moves become abnormal. He added expectations for low U.S. interest rates werebehind dollar weakness and recent moves stemmed from a fallingdollar rather than yen or euro strength. Fujii was earlier quoted as saying in a interview with theWall Street Journal, published on Wednesday, that the currentlevel of the yen was consistent with acceptable market activity.  COMMODITY FX RALLIES The euro was little changed on the day at $1.4695  butstayed in sight of near two-week highs touched on Tuesday. The dollar remained under selling pressure as risk sentimentimproved on the back of a 0.2 percent rise in U.S. stockfutures, while European shares  bobbed in and out ofpositive territory. Strength in stocks, a rally in gold, which hit a record higharound $1,050 on Wednesday, and higher oil prices helped stokedemand for currencies linked to commodity prices, including theAustralian, Canadian and New Zealand dollars. The Australian dollar  rose to $0.8951, its highestsince early August 2008, with an Australian interest rate hikeon Wenesday also providing support.  The New Zealand dollar  also hit a 14-month peak of$0.7399 ans the Canadian dollar touched a 1-year high ofC$1.0526 . "We're seeing a continuation from yesterday's trade, whenthe Aussie rose after the RBA rate rise," said Naeem Wahid,currency strategist at Bank of Scotland Treasury in London. "Growth-sensitive assets seem to getting a kick higher asequities are rallying .. Commodity currencies like the kiwi andCAD are also well bid." The dollar index was flat at 76.375 , holding above a13-month low of 75.827 hit last month.
