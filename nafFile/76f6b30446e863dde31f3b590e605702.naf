<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro vulnerable; short positions extended * Technical support eyed at $1.2679 and $1.2605 * Australian dollar bounces but still downside risks (Adds quote, updates throughout) By Neal Armstrong LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The euro stayed under broadpressure on Monday, hurt by concerns over the euro zone economywhich have seen short positions in the single currency extended. The Australian dollar recovered losses after being dented bypolitical uncertainty after an inconclusive general election. The latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showedan extension in euro short positions in the week ended Aug. 17as focus shifted away from specific concerns about the U.S.economy and back on to the euro zone. "There's a rotation going on and focus has shifted toconditions in the euro zone again. The market is trying tocapitalise on it," said Paul Mackel, director of currencystrategy at HSBC. The August euro zone flash purchasing managers index formanufacturing, which drove a large part of the economy's returnto growth in the third quarter of last year, saw the pace ofgrowth slow. "August's fall in the euro zone PMI is a sign that therecovery might be starting to slow, although the index points tostrong growth for now," said Jennifer McKeown at GlobalEconomics. At 0915 GMT, the euro was trading down 0.1 percent on theday at $1.2690. This was not far from five-week lows of $1.2664versus the dollar hit on Friday when European Central BankGoverning Council member Axel Weber said the ECB should extendits loose monetary stance, stoking worries about the euro zoneeconomy. Technical analysts said the next support was the 55-daymoving average at $1.2679, followed by $1.2605, a 50 percentretracement of its rise from a four-year low of $1.1876 markedin June to its August peak of $1.3334. Traders said the euro had been underpinned by strong demandfrom an Asian account around the day's low at $1.2683. The euro slipped 0.3 percent to 108.47 yen, near aseven-week low of 108.25 yen hit on EBS on Friday. The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 85.35 yen, within strikingdistance of 84.72 yen hit earlier this month, its lowest sinceJuly 1995. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan GovernorMasaaki Shirakawa talked about the yen in a phone conversationon Monday and agreed to work closely, but offered few clues onwhether further monetary easing was possible. AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR The Australian dollar dropped after neither of the majorparties in Australia won an overall majority in Saturday'selection, leaving the country facing its first hung parliamentin 70 years. The Aussie hit a one-month low of $0.8833 in early Pacifictrade in a knee-jerk reaction to the election but trimmed lossesto trade back to flat at $0.8930, helped by buying fromreal-money accounts. The currency received some help after Britain's Sunday Timesreported that beverage giant SABMiller was considering buyingthe beer operation of Australian brewer Foster's Group for about$10.9 billion. But a build-up of long positions left the Aussie delicatelybalanced. "There are still risks for the Aussie from long positioningand its sensitivity to global economic data," HSBC's Mackelsaid.             ]]></raw>
