<raw><![CDATA[ By Jason Szep BANGKOK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Trade ties, regional security,disaster relief and human rights will likely dominate a summitof Asia-Pacific leaders this week, offering a diplomatic testfor host Thailand after embarrassing mishaps at past summits. Six months after hundreds of anti-government protestersbroke through security barriers at a summit at Thailand'sresort town of Pattaya, forcing some Asian leaders to flee byhelicopter and abruptly ending the meeting, Thailand is takingno chances. A security force of 18,000 has cordoned off the seasidetown of Hua Hin where leaders from the 10-nation Association ofSouth East Asian Nations begin a series of meetings on Friday,first amongst themselves and then with counterparts from China,Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand. Their goal is simple: ensure no repeat of the chaoticPattaya meeting, when half of the leaders were evacuated byhelicopter and others effectively imprisoned in their hotels. Not so simple is the bigger task facing ASEAN and its EastAsia Summit grouping: how to stay relevant in a new economicorder embodied by the "Group of 20", which anointed itself lastmonth as the pre-eminent forum for global economiccoordination. The 42-year-old ASEAN has over the past decade or so beentrying to position its dialogues with other regional powers asan epicentre for economic issues at the heart of emerging Asia. But that could be overtaken, said David Kiu, an analyst atrisk consultancy Eurasia Group, as rival forums such as theAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and Group of 20industrialised and developing nations take on more prominence. "That will be something occupying the minds of both ASEANleaders and the Chinese and Japanese," said Kiu. "It is goingto be a very complex issue they are not going to resolve atthis summit, but they are going to start addressing it." RICE SPAT At least 42 agreements are expected to be signed this week,including the inauguration of an ASEAN-Australia-New Zealandfree-trade pact and an intellectual property agreement betweenASEAN and China, according to Thailand's Foreign Ministry. But the fragile global economic recovery is forcing somecountries to take a tougher line. Rice-exporter Thailandthreatened this week to delay an ASEAN free trade pact unlessit can get a "fair deal" on tariffs from the Philippines, theworld's biggest buyer of the food staple. Those differences could derail a Trade in Goods Agreementexpected to be signed this weekend, undermining a key plank ofan ambitious bid by Southeast Asia and its 540 million peopleto build an EU-style economic community by 2015. "There are issues that are cropping like this that aregoing to be an impediment to the whole process," said AlvinLiew, Southeast Asian economist at Standard Chartered Bank. "We are emerging out from a very deep global recession, andsome countries are faring much better than others." A Human Rights watchdog will be launched at the ASEANsummit, though critics say it has no teeth and is alreadydiscredited by having Myanmar, seen as a serial rights abuser,as part of the mechanism. The new body, called the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commissionon Human Rights, has no power to punish members and aims topromote rather than protect human rights. It is unlikely tohave much influence, for instance, in efforts to free Myanmaropposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi or the estimated 2,000political prisoners in the country. Myanmar's generals, however, will argue they are makingprogress. They allowed Suu Kyi recently to meet with Westerndiplomats about easing sanctions on the country, afterWashington said late last month it was embarking on a newpolicy of engagement with the junta. Yangon is also touting elections next year -- its first innearly two decades -- as a final destination of the junta's"roadmap to democracy". Myanmar's leaders "will want ASEAN and other countries toback them," said Win Min, an academic and Myanmar analyst fromPayap University in Thailand's northern city of Chiang Mai. "The other countries will try to engage rather thancriticise Myanmar," he added. (Additional reporting by Martin Petty; Editing by BillTarrant)             ]]></raw>
