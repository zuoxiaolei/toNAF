<raw><![CDATA[ * No inflation threat now but if "wait, it's too late" * China unlikely to dump U.S. assets * Says China partly influenced by lack of alternatives (Adds foreign exchange trade reaction)By Ros KrasnyCAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct 15 (Reuters) - The enormous amounts ofliquidity pumped into the U.S. financial system by the FederalReserve are not inflationary "at the moment" but will become soat some point, Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman and aWhite House adviser, said on Thursday. Volcker, now an economic adviser to President Barack Obama,said it was difficult, but necessary, to start draining thebillions of dollars in liquidity even while unemployment ratesremained high as the U.S. battles out of recession. "You have to act against what seems like common sense. Ifyou wait, it's too late," Volcker said while answeringquestions after a speech on financial markets at HarvardUniversity's Kennedy School of Government. Volcker is best known for bringing down raging inflation inthe United States after he was appointed Fed chairman in 1979-- chiefly by pushing the federal funds rate, the centralbank's key policy tool, to a peak of 20 percent in 1981. Volcker's hawkish rhetoric, urging a pro-active policyshift by the Fed, helped push up the rate of the dollar againstthe Japanese yen to a three-week high of 90.99 yen in Asiantrading, from the New York close of 90.55, according tostrategists at 4CAST Ltd. In the meantime, Volcker said the recent sharp rally in theU.S. stock market from recession lows and other signs ofrevival in financial markets should not lead to complacency inthe push for financial reforms. Volcker chairs the EconomicRecovery Advisory Board set up at the start of the Obamaadministration. Financial markets have not yet fully healed, he said, andthe economy remains plagued by structural imbalances thatthreaten to prevent a sustainable recovery taking hold from thedeep recession. "We have to regain our ability to produce goods. Movingmoney around does not necessarily provide dinner on the table,"Volcker said. "You can't run an economy where the financialsector is making 40 percent of the profits." Answering a question from the audience, Volcker said hedoubted China would embark on a major reduction of its U.S.dollar-denominated assets, partly because the alternatives tothe dollar, including the euro and the Japanese yen, do notlook that great either. China has "a great interest in the stability of thedollar," he said. Volcker said moral hazard -- the concept that investors maytake greater risks if they believe the government will protectthem from suffering losses -- remained an issue in the wake ofthe government's bailout of several major financialinstitutions, by creating expectations for future bailouts. "There is this kind of hovering concern about moral hazardthat could create another crisis down the road," Volcker said. He urged a structure in which protections were offered tocommercial banks, the "backbone" of the financial systembecause of their key role in providing credit to the economy,but not to all classes of financial institutions.
