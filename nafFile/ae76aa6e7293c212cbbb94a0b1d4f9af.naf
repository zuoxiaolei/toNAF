<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar/yen hits 15-yr low below 83 yen * Euro/dollar soars through resistance to 1-month high * Dollar falls below parity vs Swiss franc (Updates prices) NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell acrossthe board on Tuesday, touching a 15-year low below 83 yen as abreak of technical support levels in several currency pairssparked a stampede out of the greenback. With concerns growing about intervention by Japaneseauthorities to weaken the yen, the currency got a particularboost after Japan's prime minister won a leadership vote. PrimeMinister Naoto Kan won an unexpectedly decisive victory overparty heavyweight Ichiro Ozawa, who had been more strident inhis calls to intervene to weaken the yen. "A string of stories that suggest the (U.S. FederalReserve) is closer to QE2 than the market might appreciateoffers by far the best explanation for the price action in thelast 24 hours, including: higher gold, broad-based USDweakness, rallying Treasuries, curve flatteners and modestpositive risk trades," said Alan Ruskin, global head for G10 FXat Deutsche Bank in New York. A rally by the euro to a one-month peak against the dollaralso grabbed traders' attention after it broke out of its rangeof recent weeks to the upside amid market talk about possiblefurther quantitative easing in a bid to stimulate the U.S.economy. "It seems people are vacating dollar positions today andthat money is shifting into other safe-haven assets for thetime being," said Greg Salvaggio, vice president of trading atTempus Consulting in Washington, citing the yen, the Swissfranc and gold. But Salvaggio said he would be selling euros anywhere near$1.30 and buying dollar-yen below 83 in the belief the U.S.economy is beginning to turn the corner. The euro's advance began after U.S. retail sales rose morethan expected in August, notching the largest gain in fivemonths. Once the euro broke above the $1.2920 to 30 area, a levelthat had held since August, it kept going to a  one-month highof $1.3033. It was last up 1 percent at 1.3007. The significant break came in late morning New York tradeon market talk that Goldman Sachs said in a research note thatwhile it suspects the Federal Reserve will ratchet down growthforecasts, the revision is unlikely to be enough to sparkadditional easing. The Wall Street Journal quoted Goldman Sachs chief U.S.economist Jan Hatzius on Tuesday reiterating the bank's view onquantitative easing. The euro was up 0.3 percent at 108.07 yen. The Goldman note talk also pushed the dollar index, anon-traded calculation that measures the dollar's performanceagainst six currencies, below the 200-day simple moving averagefor the second straight day, according to Reuters data. The index is now oversold for the first time since Aug. 6based on the 14-day relative strength index. Amid broad U.S. dollar woes, the Australian dollar surgedto its highest against its U.S. counterpart since mid-2008after breaching an important technical level. It was last at$0.941, up 0.7 percent from late Monday. The move acceleratedafter the currency broke above a recent high around $0.9365. YEN BREAK The dollar fell to a 15-year low of 82.92 on electronictrading platform EBS and 82.93 on Reuters. It last traded at83.10, down 0.7 percent on the day. The yen has gained more than 10 percent against the dollarthis year as recent weak U.S. data and record-low bond yieldsdrove money away from U.S. assets. Japan worries that a strongyen will hurt its export-driven economy. The Kan victory provided "positive yen news," said JosephTrevisani, chief analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle River, NewJersey. But he added that "83 has no more meaning than thetypical round number in dollar/yen. The level to look at is theall-time low." That low is at 79.75 yen. Tempus' Savalggio suggested that Japanese interventionbelow 83 yen is a real risk and suggested going short yen.Traders also cited "stop-loss" orders around 82.85 yen.    Ifthe dollar hits 82 yen in a couple of hours, the risk ofintervention would rise, analysts say. Dollar/yen three-month composite risk reversal was at -2.15on Tuesday from -1.9 on Monday, with a bias to dollar puts andyen calls and indicating slightly more bullishness on the yen. Boris Schlossberg, head of research at GFT Forex, saidtraders would try to push the dollar toward the all-time lowbeneath 80 yen, though he said if U.S. economic data starts toimprove, short dollar positions could be in for a squeeze. Lingering doubts about the longer-term global outlook keptthe safe-haven Swiss franc in demand. The dollar fell to 0.9934francs, the lowest since late November 2009.             ]]></raw>
