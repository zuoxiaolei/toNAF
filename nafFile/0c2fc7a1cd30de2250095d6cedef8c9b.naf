<raw><![CDATA[   * EU summit next week to focus on possible Greek aid * Sterling falls vs dollar on UK economy worries * Euro tumbles vs Swiss franc to 17-month low (Updates prices) By Steven C. Johnson NEW YORK, March 19 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Friday overdoubts Greece would win euro-zone aid, capping its worst weeksince January, and concerns about the UK economy hit sterling. A report on Thursday that Greece saw limited prospects foreuro-zone assistance raised concerns about the country'sability to service its debt. On Friday, the euro fell as far as$1.3502, its lowest level in more than two weeks. It was down1.7 percent this week, its worst showing since late January. Greece said it may have to turn to the InternationalMonetary Fund for help, though it dismissed news reports it wasplanning to do so as early as April. If Greece fails to win euro-zone support, analysts say themarket may view the euro zone as unwilling or unable to solveinternal financial crises. "The tensions surrounding Greece are escalating. This wholeIMF situation has become a game of brinkmanship and the wholeuncertainty is undermining the euro," said Michael Woolfolk,senior currency strategist, at BNY Mellon in New York. European Union leaders are set to meet next week to discussrescue plans for Greece. The euro was last trading at 1,3535,down about half a percent, while investors demanded a higherpremium to buy 10-year Greek debt over German bunds. Sterling also fell sharply, dipping briefly below $1.50,after a Bank of England policy maker said there was some riskof a double-dip recession in Britain. The pound was last downabout 1.5 percent at $1.5017. European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet andother officials have ruled out IMF assistance to Greece, butGerman policy makers have said the IMF may have a role toplay. "From the perspective of the investor, events continue tobe frustratingly opaque," said Andrew Wilkinson, senior marketanalyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut."Repeated meetings result in no clear statement other than acommitment that now appears far less solid than before." A decline in major U.S. stock indexes on Friday reflectsheightened risk aversion, BNY Mellon's Woolfolk said, and couldspell more trouble for the euro. "I really don't see any support for the euro. We may haveto test that low below $1.3450 in the near term," he said. YEN FLAT, SWISS FRANC RISES The dollar was up 0.2 percent at 90.47 yen while the eurofell 0.4 percent to 1.4346 Swiss francs. Earlier, the euro slipped as far as 1.4320 francs, a17-month low, following Thursday's remarks from a SwissNational Bank official. Board member Jean-Pierre Danthine saidinterest rates cannot stay low forever and Swiss firms andconsumers should prepare for higher borrowing costs. But at a policy meeting last week, the SNB's statement didnot drop a pledge to counter excessive gains in the franc as itcontinues to appreciate against the euro. Traders are focusing on the 1.4300 area, the record low, asthe next support level. Options structures were said to beprevalent at that level. The Canadian dollar gained after Canadian core inflationunexpectedly rose in February. Earlier, the U.S. dollar fell toa 20-month low at C$1.0062, but the greenback recovered totrade up 0.2 percent at C$1.0166.
