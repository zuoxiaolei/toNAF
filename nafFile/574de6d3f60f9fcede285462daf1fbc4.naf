<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro tumbles on escalating Libya turmoil, pares losses * Libya violence fuels risk aversion, pushes oil higher * New Zealand dollar suffers after earthquake (Adds comment, details, updates prices) By Naomi Tajitsu LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday whilethe dollar rallied broadly after escalating political tension inLibya prompted selling in higher-yielding assets for the safetyof the U.S. currency and also the Swiss franc. The New Zealand dollar hit a near two-month low against itsU.S. counterpart on speculation that the economic damage causedby an earthquake which rocked the country's second biggest citymay increase the chance of an interest rate cut. Risk aversion gripped the currency market after the defianceof Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in the face of a mountingpublic revolt stoked political uncertainty and prompted a supplycut in one of the world's major oil exporters. "Investors are scaling down on exposure across the board,"said Richard Falkenhall, currency strategist at SEB inStockholm. "Libya is the first major oil-exporting country to beaffected ... if this spreads to other oil-exporting countries,it will not be a good sign." The euro fell as much as 1 percent on the day to $1.3527,according to Reuters data. The single currency clawed back from losses, climbing toaround $1.3635 by 1043 GMT, as traders cited Asian demand,including sovereign names. Market participants said a media report quoting EuropeanCentral Bank policymaker Yves Mersch saying he would not besurprised if the central bank soon adjusts its language oninflation helped to push the euro up. The move underlined the market's ongoing focus on risinginflation risks and their impact on global interest rates.  EXPORT CONCERNS Oil prices rallied, keeping Brent crude near $108 per barrelafter it hit a 2 1/2-year high on Monday, while U.S. crudejumped 9 percent. Higher oil prices are seen weighing on global growth,particularly in emerging countries heavily dependent on oil andcommodity imports. Rising prices have already led to higherinflation, which can threaten vulnerable economies. Analysts said the mix of oil into tensions in the MiddleEast and North Africa prompted a bigger FX reaction to events inLibya than overthrows of governments in Tunisia and Egypt. Once knee-jerk risk aversion subsided, some said investorswould focus on the impact of festering violence in Libya on oilsupply channels, as well as any spread in political oppositionto Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter. Big moves in the spot market cranked up implied volatilityin major currencies, with euro one-week vols jumping above 11percent, from around 9.4 percent on Monday. The New Zealand dollar tumbled more than 2 percent on theday to $0.7469, its weakest since late December. Market participants said the currency extended losses afterWestpac Bank said New Zealand's central bank may cut rates toshore up confidence, adding that a rate cut may occur at orbefore a policy meet next month. DOLLAR CORRECTION The dollar rose 0.6 percent to 78.148 against a currencybasket, hovering above a two-month low of 76.881 hit earlierthis month. The dollar's high liquidity attracted risk-averse investorsdespite issues which have been plaguing the currency, includingspeculation that U.S. interest rates would stay low, andconcerns about the country's growing deficits. Audrey Childe-Freeman, head of EMEA FX strategy at JPMorganPrivate Bank, said geopolitical tensions had sparked a dollarcorrection, but added it was unclear how long this may last. "If the region stabilises and tensions don't spread beyondLibya, and if there is a perception the region is going to beunder control ... I think we will return to the risk-on,monetary policy-driven trade," she said. The single currency fell 1 percent on the day to 1.2793Swiss francs, pushing the traditional safe-haven currency to itsstrongest since late January. The yen, which often benefits in times of geopoliticalconcerns, rose, taking in its stride a warning on its sovereignrating by agency Moody's. The euro fell more than 1 percent to 112.24 yen, brushingoff concerns that higher oil prices could have a deep impact onthe Japanese economy, which is heavily reliant on oil imports.The dollar slipped 0.3 percent 82.85 yen.
