<raw><![CDATA[ * Export sales picked up over Christmas * Price volatility scares buyers  By Svetlana Kovalyova VICENZA, Italy, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The volume of jewelleryexports from Italy, Europe's top producer, is expected to startrecovering in 2011 after last year's flat performance on low2009 levels, a senior industry official said on Saturday. "We hope, we expect that in 2010 we remained in line with2009 volume levels, which were very low. That already will be avery good signal that the bleeding has stopped," said Stefano dePascale, director of the Italian goldsmiths' body Federorafi. "I hope the recovery will start in 2011," de Pascale toldReuters in an interview at a key international jewellery fair innorthern Italy. He was citing preliminary industry estimates. Italian jewellery used to dominate the world markets, but ithas lost market share over the past seven to eight years torivals in China, India and Turkey. The global economic crisis of2008-2009 also dealt it a strong blow. De Pascale, who in November expected a 10-12 percent fall in2010 export volumes, said sales picked up during the crucialChristmas period, which can account for up to 50 percent ofannual jewellery sales, especially to the U.S. market. In value terms, Italian jewellery exports jumped 26.2percent year-on-year to 3.22 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in thefirst nine months of 2010, driven by soaring gold and silverprices, organisers of the Vicenza fair said on Thursday. Stripped of the effect of surging precious metals prices,the post-crisis recovery of Italian jewellery exports is slowand the sector will take several years to return to pre-crisisvolumes, de Pascale said.  SURGING PRICES A long-awaited trend reversal in export volumes will dependon the stabilisation of metals prices, on the pace of globaleconomic recovery and on the easing of import duties in some keymarkets such as the United States and Asia, he said. Gold prices rose nearly 30 percent in 2010 as economicuncertainty and concerns over Europe's sovereign debt crisisspurred investment in the metal as a safe haven. They hit anall-time high above $1,430 an ounce on Dec. 7. De Pascale said metal price volatility and concerns thatwhat he described as the "gold bubble" may burst soon scarewholesale and retail jewellery buyers, who are postponing ordersand refraining from rebuilding stocks nearly wiped out duringthe crisis. Instead of making a big order at the start of a year as theyused to do in the past, buyers now place small orders throughoutthe year to reduce exposure to price volatility and weak demand,he said. With about 70 percent of Italian jewellery sold abroad,export volumes are a clear indication of precious metalsconsumption by the jewellery industry.  Italy's jewellery fabrication demand for gold is estimatedto have fallen by 5-10 percent in 2010 from about 123 tonnes in2009, dropping to about a fifth of the 1998 peak output,according to metals consultancy GFMS.  "Probably, we'll never return to the levels of the 1990s.The market has completely changed since then, even in the waybuyers place orders," de Pascale said. The fair will run from Jan. 15 to Jan. 20 in Vicenza, amajor jewellery manufacturing centre in Italy. (Reporting by Svetlana Kovalyova, editing by Jane Baird)             ]]></raw>
