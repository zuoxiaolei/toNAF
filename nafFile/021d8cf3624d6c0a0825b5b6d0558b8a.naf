<raw><![CDATA[* EU Commission President criticises "deficiencies" in work * Barroso - market mood not fundamentals influenced ratings * Comments follow warning of new EU controls on sector   By John O'Donnell BRUSSELS, May 5 (Reuters) - The president of the EuropeanCommission has criticised what he called the deficient work ofcredit rating agencies, saying they let the dark mood infinancial markets cloud their judgement. Jose Manuel Barroso's remarks, the harshest such criticismfrom the powerful EU executive, come amid growing frustrationamong senior officials with rating agencies for downgradingGreece as it teetered on the edge of financial collapse. Barroso's remarks followed a stark warning earlier in theweek from Michel Barnier, the European commissioner in charge ofan overhaul of financial services, and further boosted thechances of tougher European controls of the sector. "Deficiencies in their working methods has led to ratingsbeing too cyclical, too reliant on the general market moodrather than on fundamentals - regardless of whether market moodis too optimistic or too pessimistic," Barroso told lawmakers inthe European parliament on Wednesday. The head of the European law-making executive signalled thatfurther controls could be introduced for the industry. These would go beyond new rules that start later this yearwhich require the agencies to explain how they arrive at theratings that can determine a country's financial survival. "We have also launched a reflection on whether furthermeasures may be needed to ensure the appropriate rating ofsovereign debt in particular," he said. In his role as president of the executive for 27 Europeancountries, Barroso has significant power in deciding how ratingagencies are allowed to do business. Earlier in the week, Barnier had warned credit ratingagencies to watch their step when judging a country's financialhealth, saying the commission would probe how they work andcould even set up a central agency to take on their job. Barnier signalled his dissatisfaction that just threecompanies -- Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch -- dominatethe industry. Debt-laden Greece, which was last weekend bailed out by a110 billion euro ($147 billion) rescue from European neighboursand the International Monetary Fund, has been marked down tojunk status by S&P and now hovers close to Pakistan in thecredit stakes. Rating agencies had been blamed for carelessness in the runup to the global crash, handing out over-generous ratings on thepackets of mortgage and consumer debt that subsequentlyunravelled, sending the economy into a spin.
