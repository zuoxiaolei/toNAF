<raw><![CDATA[  * Manuel left out of new cabinet groupings * Key policy maker Netshitenzhe quits * Opposition says labour, communists taking control of ANC  By Peroshni Govender JOHANNESBURG, Oct 22, (Reuters) - Changes to the way SouthAfrican President Jacob Zuma's cabinet operates and theresignation of a senior policy maker have stirred investor fearsthat unions are shifting economic policy to the left. Zuma this week announced new cabinet clusters, tasked withplanning and decision-making, that left out former financeminister Trevor Manuel, who was widely respected by markets andnow heads a new planning commission. The resignation of Joel Netshitenzhe, an architect of policysince the end of apartheid, added to concerns that Zuma may bebowing to labour and communists, who are allied with the rulingAfrican National Congress and helped bring him to power. "I am concerned that a slow victory of the left is takingshape in so far as interest groups are placing themselves inpositions of power," said an analyst with a financial servicesfirm, who declined to be named. Manuel, who steered South Africa's economy through itslongest period of recorded growth, is loathed by powerful tradeunions who saw him as a champion of business-friendly economicpolicies under former President Thabo Mbeki. A government paper on the planning commission is underdiscussion in parliament and cabinet and if the paper is watereddown, Manuel could resign, said Mike Davies, Middle East andAfrica analyst at Eurasia Group. "This will clearly unsettle market confidence as Manuelcontinues to be seen as a key balancing figure in Zuma'sadministration. However, it is unlikely that Manuel will backaway from a fight easily." Zuma, in office since May, has been under pressure fromlabour federation COSATU and the South African Communist Party(SACP) to move economic policy to the left to help the country'smillions of poor. They want more government spending on welfare and jobcreation, lower taxes for the poor and for the central bank tobe brought under state control.  TENSIONS? Netshitenzhe's resignation after 15 years in governmentraised concerns of possible tensions within the alliance of theANC, COSATU and the SACP. He had also been close to Mbeki. ANC officials said Netshitenzhe resigned because his policydepartment was to be re-organised and he was concerned the ANCwas overly influencing and dictating government programmes. "He was a Thabo Mbeki loyalist who wanted to work with Zumabut it's becoming too difficult," one senior ANC official toldReuters, adding that he had also criticised the ruling party formicro-managing policy. The opposition Inkatha Freedom Party said his resignationraised serious questions. "Is this proof that the SACP and COSATU are now firmly incharge of the ANC?," it said in a statement. The unions and communists, as well as politicians on theleft of the ANC, have gained strength since succeeding ingetting the ruling party to force Mbeki from the presidency in2008. The official said Zuma's decision to appoint labour-backedEconomic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel to the economiccluster over Manuel was the final straw for Netshitenzhe. In recent weeks, labour unions have insisted that Pateldevise a plan to steer South Africa out of its first recessionin 17 years, rejecting Manuel's planning commission. But Eurasia's Davies said Manuel's exclusion should not beseen as a sign that his influence is waning, adding that he didnot think labour and the communists have gained the upper hand. "I don't think it is the case that the left has gainedcontrol. Zuma is looking like he constantly does (try) toappease all interested parties in these types of issues," Daviessaid.
