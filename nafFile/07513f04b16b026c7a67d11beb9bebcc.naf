<raw><![CDATA[© Reuters.  Dollar still at multi-year highs vs. rivals in quiet tradeInvesting.com - The dollar remained within close distance of a 14-year peak against the other major currencies on Monday, as overall optimism over the U.S. economy since Donald Trump’s election and expectations for an upcoming rate hike continued to support the greenback.EUR/USD gained 0.36% to 1.0627, off Friday’s 11-month trough of 1.0579.The greenback has remained supported amid expectations that President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to ramp up fiscal spending and cut taxes will spur economic growth and inflation.Faster growth would spark inflation, which in turn would prompt the Fed to tighten monetary policy a faster rate than had previously been expected.The U.S. dollar has also been boosted by bets that the U.S. central bank will almost certainly raise interest rates next month.Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday reiterated that a rate hike “could well become appropriate relatively soon.”Investors were looking ahead to a speech by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi due later in the day, after he said on Friday that the central bank will continue to act as warranted using all instruments available.Speaking at the 26th European Banking Congress, in Frankfurt, Draghi added that the euro zone’s economic recovery still relies to a considerable degree on accommodative monetary policy.Elsewhere, GBP/USD rallied 1.25% to 1.2498.USD/JPY slipped 0.11% to 110.78, after rising to a six-month high of 111.19 overnight, while USD/CHF edged down 0.17% to 1.0083.The Australian and New Zealand dollars pushed higher, with AUD/USD up 0.52% at 0.7371 and with NZD/USD jumping 0.96% to 0.7072.Meanwhile, USD/CAD retreated 0.82% to trade at 1.3394.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.48% at 100.92, just off Friday’s fresh 14-year peak of 101.54.             ]]></raw>
