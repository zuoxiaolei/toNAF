<raw><![CDATA[ * China official takes aim at U.S. monetary easing * Official says U.S. needs to recognise responsibility * Says easing sets off money flows that are financial shock  (Recasts, adds quotes, details) BEIJING, Nov 8 (Reuters) - China ratcheted up pressure onWashington over the U.S. Fed's latest moves to lift its economyby printing more money, with a vice finance minister sayingresulting hot money inflows were a shock to global markets. In the run-up to this week's G20 and APEC meetings, a numberof leading economies have warned against the Federal Reserve'sdecision last week to inject an extra $600 billion into the U.S.banking system. "As a major reserve currency issuer, for the United States tolaunch a second round of quantitative easing at this time, wefeel that it did not recognise its responsibility to stabiliseglobal markets and did not think about the impact of excessiveliquidity on emerging markets," Chinese Vice Finance Minister ZhuGuangyao said at a briefing on Monday. Zhu said that China plans "frank discussions" with the UnitedStates over its money printing plans. China and the United States had turned down the heat in theacrimonious dispute over currencies and trade imbalances at ameeting of finance ministers from the 21-member Asia-PacificEconomic Cooperation (APEC) forum over the weekend. But Zhu said on Monday that the Fed's quantitative easing wasa poor decision. He said the United States must recognise itsrole and responsibility in the global economy. A leading Chinese newspaper warned on Monday thatWashington's actions were a form of indirect currencymanipulation that could lead to a new round of currency wars andeven global economic collapse. [ID:nTOE6A601T] For his part, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in recentdays has been defending the bond-buying, saying the measures tohelp restore a strong U.S. economy were critical for globalfinancial stability. [ID:nN06139568] Despite the heated rhetoric aimed at U.S. economicpolicymakers, Zhu predicted on Monday that the G20 meeting wouldsend a positive signal to global markets. "We, including the Federal Reserve, will strengthencoordination of and communication about macroeconomic policiesand monetary policies." He said the current global situation was different from thatat the height of the global financial crisis. "Financial markets do not lack capital, but the capital lacksconfidence in the real economy," he said.
