<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The euro retreated from a four-month high against the U.S. dollar last week, before trimming gains after European Union leaders said they had reached an agreement on a German-inspired competitiveness pact that calls for far reaching reforms across the single currency bloc. EUR/USD hit 1.4035 on Monday, the pair’s highest since November 8; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3900 by close of trade on Friday, shedding 0.62% over the week.The pair is likely to find support at 1.3751, Friday’s low and a seven-day low and resistance at 1.4035, last Monday’s high.On Friday, European Union President Herman Van Rompuy said euro-area leaders reached an agreement “in principle on the pact for the euro.” The plan is intended to boost competitiveness by curbing deficits and reducing labor costs. Leaders scheduled to meet in Brussels have set a March 25 deadline to approve a comprehensive package. The agreement was considered a necessary precursor for EU leaders to reach an agreement to overhaul the 17-nation bloc's bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility.Earlier in the week, the single currency came under pressure amid fresh concerns over the sovereign debt load of peripheral nations.
