<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar gains, Aussie tumbles as China hikes rates * Market awaits a host of Fed speakers for clues on QE * U.S. Treasury's Geithner comments support dollar (Updates prices, adds reaction to China rate hike) By Jessica Mortimer LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The dollar gained while theAustralian dollar and other commodity-linked currencies fellsharply on Tuesday after China's central bank raised interestrates, sparking a sell-off in perceived riskier currencies. The People's Bank of China surprised markets by raising itsbenchmark one-year lending and deposit rate by 25 basis pointseffective from Oct. 20, the first rate increase in nearly threeyears. [ID:nSGE69I0HU] The euro extended losses against the dollar on the news, butthe Australian dollar was one of the main losers, with investorsconcerned the move could dampen growth in China, hittingcommodity-linked economies in particular. "The gut reaction of the market is to sell commodity blockand emerging market currencies," said Kit Juckes, currencystrategist at Societe Generale. But he added the move was "not a game changer", and thatinvestors would be looking to pick up these currencies on dips. The dollar extended earlier gains which came after U.S.Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said the United States would notengage in dollar devaluation and needed to work hard to preserveconfidence in a strong dollar. [ID:nN18287076] At 1155 GMT, the euro  was down 0.6 percent, hitting asession low of $1.3853, taking it well below Friday's eight anda half month high of $1.4161, hit on trading platform EBS. The euro turned lower again, having earlier cut losses afterGermany's ZEW institute said its economic sentiment index was at-7.2 in October, down from -4.3 in September but better thanforecasts of -8.0. [ID:nLDE69I0WE]. The Australian dollar tumbled more than 1 percent on the dayto hit a session low of $0.9776 , a steep fall fromaround $0.9885 before the China announcement. DOLLAR FIRMER Against a basket of currencies the dollar  rose to asession high of 77.720, its strongest in five days. Technicalanalysts say it needs to extend above its Oct. 12 high of 77.93to signal a short-term bottom is in place after Friday's10-month trough of 76.144. The U.S. currency has been backed by a view among many inthe market that the monetary easing expected from the U.S.Federal Reserve next month is largely priced in. But the market must wait to see how sizeable the QE willactually be. Until then, short-term players were simply flippingpositions within tight ranges, traders said. "Comments from Geithner and a reversal in short dollarpositions is pushing it higher," said Gareth Berry, currencystrategist at UBS, Singapore. "But this will not last too longwith many waiting to see what the Fed will do next month." A host of speakers from the Fed are due to speak on Tuesday.More and more policymakers are signing up for QE, so anyindications how far the U.S. central bank will go to stimulatethe economy could weigh on the dollar. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is scheduled to give brief remarkswhile New York Fed President William Dudley, Chicago Fed chiefCharles Evans, Atlanta Fed chief Dennis Lockhart, MinneapolisFed President Narayana Kocherlakota and Dallas Fed PresidentRichard Fisher are expected to speak later in the day. Analysts said Geithner's comments on the U.S. dollar aheadof the G-20 meeting meant the United States was trying to workout an agreement with emerging economies like China which wouldease the currency tensions that have marked the past few weeks. The dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 81.59 yen, creeping further away from a 15-year low of 80.88 hitlast week and a record low of 79.75 set in 1995.
