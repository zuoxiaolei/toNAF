<raw><![CDATA[ * President's forecasts differ from state oil firm * Chavez sees potential for five-fold output rise in 20 yrs  (Adds outlook for production) CARACAS, May 23 (Reuters) - OPEC member Venezuela willincrease oil production "gradually" in 2010, then even morenext year, President Hugo Chavez said on Sunday. Chavez's comments contradicted previous statements by oilofficials that Venezuela's production -- which they put at 3million barrels per day -- will not increase this year. International energy organizations put the South Americannation's output closer to 2.3-2.4 million bpd currently. "We are going to increase oil output progressively from theend of this year, and in 2011 we will have an important rise,"Chavez said on his weekly TV program "Hello President". Chavez gave no further explanation for his forecasts. Venezuela has various projects in the pipeline to increaseoutput from its Orinoco heavy-crude belt, but they are notexpected to start coming on stream until 2012. Chavez said production should rise by one million bpdbetween 2010 and 2015, though state oil firm PDVSA has forecasta production level of 5.8 million bpd in 2012. Venezuela has the potential to raise production five-foldin the next two decades, the president added. Venezuela agreed to a 380,000 bpd cut last year in linewith OPEC reductions. But Chavez said Venezuela's plannedoutput increases would not clash with OPEC quotas because"there are OPEC nations unable to fulfill their quotas becausetheir production has come down."
