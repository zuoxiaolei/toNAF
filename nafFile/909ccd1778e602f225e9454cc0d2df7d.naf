<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The pound extended gains against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, but gains were expected to remain capped ahead of a series of key U.S. events and as concerns over the U.K. outlook for growth continued to weigh.   GBP/USD hit 1.5768 during U.S. morning trade, the session high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.5769, climbing 0.50%.   Cable was likely to find support at 1.5673, Monday’s low and a five-month low and resistance at 1.5784, Monday's high.   Investors remained cautious ahead of a number of significant U.S. economic events later in the week, including data on fourth quarter growth and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy statement on Wednesday, as well as Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls data.   The pound was also under pressure after data on Friday showed that the U.K. economy contracted 0.3% in the fourth quarter, putting Britain on track for a triple-dip recession.Meanwhile, comments by incoming BoE Governor Mark Carney over the weekend were seen as increasing the likelihood for more easing measures by the central bank.Mr. Carney said he would be willing to see inflation remain above the central bank’s 2% target for longer if this helped spur growth.   In the U.S., the Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence fell to 58.6 in January, a 14-month low, from a reading of 66.7 in December, whose figure was revised up from 65.1. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 64.0 in January.   In a separate report, Standard & Poor’s with Case-Shiller said its house price index rose at an annualized rate of 5.5% in November from a year earlier, increasing for the eighth consecutive month, broadly in line with market expectations. U.S. home prices in October rose by a revised 4.2%.   Sterling was also higher against the euro with EUR/GBP shedding 0.23%, to hit 0.8554.   Also Tuesday, Research group Gfk said that its index of German consumer climate ticked up to 5.8 in January from a reading of 5.7 the previous month, beating expectations for the index to remain unchanged.             ]]></raw>
