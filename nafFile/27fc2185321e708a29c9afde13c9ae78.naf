<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The euro slipped lower against the greenback Wednesday, after the release of disappointing U.S. economic data, while worries regarding Greece's new debt target and U.S. fiscal policy decisions continued to weigh. EUR/USD hit 1.2882 during U.S. trade, the pair's lowest since November 23; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2920, giving back 0.18%.  The U.S. Census Bureau reported new home sales fell by 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted 368,000 units in October, confounding expectations for an increase to 390,000.  New home sales for September were revised down to 369,000 units from a previously reported 389,000.  Meanwhile, investors continued to monitor developments surrounding the looming “fiscal cliff” in the U.S., approximately USD600 billion in automatic tax hikes and spending cuts due to come into effect on January 1.  Sentiment weakened on Tuesday after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he was frustrated by the lack of progress in talks over the U.S. budget impasse in Washington.  The euro also remained under pressure due to the lack of detail on how Greece will implement reforms needed to meet its new debt targets.  Earlier in the week, euro zone finance ministers, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund reached an agreement to reduce Greece’s debt-reduction target by EUR40 billion to 124% of gross domestic product by 2020. Elsewhere, the euro was lower against the pound with EUR/GBP falling 0.10%, to hit 0.8069.               ]]></raw>
