<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The pound fell to a fresh session low against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke stopped short of indicating if the central bank was considering fresh stimulus measures in testimony to the U.S. Senate.GBP/USD hit 1.5574 during U.S. morning trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.5580, shedding 0.34%.Cable was likely to find support at 1.5516, Monday’s low and resistance at 1.5653, Monday’s high.Bernanke delivered a negative assessment of the outlook for the U.S. economy, saying growth had lost momentum in the first half of the year and added that efforts to reduce the U.S. unemployment rate were progressing “frustratingly” slowly.However, he refrained from indicating whether the Fed would embark on a third round of quantitative easing to stimulate the economy, but reiterated that the central bank was prepared to take further action to support the economic recovery, if necessary.In the U.K., official data showed that consumer price inflation fell to its lowest in more than two-and-a-half years in June, as retailers offered discounts on clothing and shoes to encourage consumers to spend.The Office for National Statistics said the annual rate of CPI dropped to 2.4% from 2.8% in May, the lowest level since November 2009. Economists had expected the rate of inflation to remain unchanged.The unexpectedly weak data fuelled expectations that the Bank of England is unlikely to exit its monetary easing policy in the near term, after the central bank increased the size of its asset purchase program earlier this month.Elsewhere, sterling was trading close to a three-and-a-half year high against the euro, with EUR/GBP slipping 0.18% to 0.7834.In the euro zone, Spain saw short-term borrowing costs fall at an auction of 12 and 18-month government bonds earlier, but the yield on the country’s 10-year bonds was at 6.76%, remaining close to the critical 7% threshold amid sustained concerns over the country’s finances.Also Tuesday, official data showed that core CPI in the U.S. rose 0.2% in June, broadly in line with market expectations, while prices including food and energy costs were flat.A separate report showed that industrial production in the U.S. rose 0.4% in June, just above expectations for a 0.3% increase.             ]]></raw>
