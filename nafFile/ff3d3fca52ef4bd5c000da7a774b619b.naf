<raw><![CDATA[ * President unlikely to expel recalcitrant coalitionmembers * Divisions could slow reform and deter bold policymaking * But robust fundamentals to keep sentiment buoyant, fornow By Sunanda Creagh JAKARTA, March 4 (Reuters) - Bitter divisions inIndonesia's ruling coalition will stifle policymaking and slowreform, but the country's strong fundamentals founded on robustdomestic demand should prevent asset prices suffering much forthe moment. Three coalition parties crossed the floor and voted withthe opposition on Wednesday to demand a criminal investigationof two key reformist technocrats in President Susilo BambangYudhoyono's cabinet over a controversial bank rescue. Analysts expect Yudhoyono to defy pressure to fire VicePresident Boediono and Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati. But he is unlikely to expel his recalcitrant coalitionpartners from the government -- even though their attempt toexploit the Bank Century scandal to oust the technocratssignalled strong opposition to the pro-market economic reformsthat investors want Yudhoyono to spearhead in his second term. "This does put the coalition under great stress. This willmean reduced functioning of the cabinet. This makes reform muchmore difficult," said Greg Fealy at the Australian NationalUniversity. But he saw little chance Yudhoyono would break upthe coalition, "because he is usually a safe playerpolitically". Besides the staunch opposition to reform from somecoalition members -- in particular the Golkar party thatdominated politics for decades during the rule of authoritarianformer President Suharto -- pro-market policymaking will alsosuffer if Indrawati and Boediono are distracted from their jobsby a criminal probe. The government's efforts to boost tax collection and drivereform in the civil service, labour law and land acquisitioncould be threatened -- with negative implications for the stockmarket, bonds and the rupiah. BULLISH SENTIMENT SHAKEN BUT NOT STIRRED Expectations that last year's decisive election victory forYudhoyono -- known as "SBY" -- would mean a faster pace ofreform were a key factor in making Indonesia one of 2009's staremerging markets, with stocks up 90 percent, government bondsrising 20 percent and the rupiah up 17 percent against thedollar. Those hopes are now at risk. Yet sentiment remains bullish. "We do recognise that following last year's positiveelectoral outcome, expectations may be set too high by someforeign investors and there may be some disappointment in thepace of reform," HSBC said in a recent report. But it addedthat "reform will come surely if slowly, and near-termpolitical volatility is not a substantial threat to localmarkets." Finance ministry data shows net foreign investment in localbonds stood at a record 121.5 trillion rupiah ($13 billion)this week, with inflows of 6 trillion rupiah since the end ofJanuary despite the fractious political climate. ING saidcapital inflows would bring the 10-year bond yield down to 9percent in the next three months from 9.54 percent at the lastclose. HSBC said Indonesia's benign inflation, manageable fiscaldeficit and low borrowing gave its sovereign bonds a"credibility premium", but warned this would be tested incoming months "due to uncertainty over ... Sri Mulyani's futurein the cabinet and whether SBY's reform agenda has beenpermanently weakened." Stocks are up 1.29 percent since the start of 2010, despitebroad selling of emerging market assets seen as overbought, andahead of regional peers Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines. KEEP FRIENDS CLOSE, BUT ENEMIES CLOSER A central figure in machinations to undermine Indrawati andBoediono is Golkar party leader and tycoon Aburizal Bakrie,whose conglomerate prospered under the rule of Suharto. Golkarhas close links with Indonesia's traditional business eliteswho could be threatened by reform. Tensions between Bakrie and Indrawati erupted in 2008during the height of the global financial meltdown as concernsabout the financial health of the tycoon's companies batteredtheir share prices. During the worst of the storm Bakrie helpedengineer the shut-down of the stock market and Indrawatiordered it reopened. They have clashed again over her tax collection drive --the tax office says Bakrie firms owe hundreds of millions ofdollars, knocking shares in his mining firm Bumi Resources.Plenty more of Indonesia's established tycoons are equallyreluctant to see tax collectors pursue them too vigorously. Fealy said despite Bakrie's behaviour, Yudhoyono wouldprobably rather keep Golkar within the coalition, where hecould at least exert limited control over it. He expected thetax department and Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) topress on with their work despite the opposition of powerfulfigures. Also, even if Yudhoyono caves in to pressure to allow acriminal probe of his reformers, many expect them to beexonerated -- potentially strengthening their hand longer-term. "It would be very difficult to prove they gained somepersonal benefit from this bailout. So the Democrats should beoptimistic that even if there is an investigation, things willturn out OK for them," said Aleksius Jemadu, an analyst atJakarta's Pelita Harapan University. Yet while market fallout from the affair may be limited,and investor enthusiasm over Indonesia is set to continue, thereform struggle may slow gains by stocks and the rupiah thisyear, and even delay a sovereign upgrade to investment grade. "No one is going to want to make tough decisions now," saidJakarta-based analyst Kevin Evans. But he also did not expecttroublesome coalition members to be thrown out: "If it was justone party you might be able to exact some revenge but if anoverwhelming chunk crossed the floor, it's not so easy." "Despite the low likelihood of a constitutional -- letalone a political -- crisis, the loss of parliamentaryconfidence is still a blow to the government and will haveadverse implications," said Standard Chartered analyst FauziIchsan. He said the struggle over Bank Century had strainedrelations between parliament and the central bank and financeministry, complicating fiscal policy and the establishment ofan independent banking regulator. More importantly, he warned, concerns that a lack ofcoalition unity would undermine the government's effectiveness"may further delay a sovereign rating upgrade for Indonesia". The title of his research note summarised a view ofIndonesia shared by many investors: "Bad politics, goodeconomics."
