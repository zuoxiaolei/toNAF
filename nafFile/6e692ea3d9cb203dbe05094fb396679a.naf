<raw><![CDATA[  * Petrobras offer to lure about $25 billion from abroad * C.bank may call 3 or more dollar auctions on Fri or Mon * Dollar weakness, corporate deals to keep currency strong By Samantha Pearson SAO PAULO, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Hosting the world'slargest-ever share offering has not been easy. Brazil has battled to control the rapid appreciation of itscurrency as foreigners pour money into a $79 billion offeringby state-controlled oil company Petrobras, which is expected toprice later on Thursday. But the country's booming growth and an ever-weaker dollaris likely to continue to support Brazil's real, inflictingfurther damage on the country's industry. Despite the authorities' efforts, the real is now the mostovervalued major currency in the world, according to GoldmanSachs. Exporters are suffering as their goods become moreexpensive abroad and manufacturers are struggling to competewith a flood of cheap imports. After the last of the Petrobras funds trickle in next week,Brazilian authorities will be hoping the real makes a hastyretreat from its recent highs. But analysts are not so convinced. "Some of the pressure will probably disappear but thelong-term appreciation trend will remain," says Marianna Costa,an economist with Link Investimentos in Sao Paulo. Robust economic growth, fuelled by a growing middle classand higher commodity prices, has boosted the currency 100percent since 2003, and this trend is likely tocontinue.currently be trading somewhere around 1.75 per dollar,says Pedro Tuesta, senior Latin America economist at 4Cast inWashington. That would still be close to its strongest levelthis year of 1.702 and almost 3 percent firmer than the end ofJune. The real was trading around 1.720 in the local spot marketon Thursday. CENTRAL BANK SHOWDOWN The most likely reason for the real to continue toappreciate has nothing to do with Brazil. The concern is notthe strong real but the weak dollar, analysts say. The Federal Reserve indicated this week it may introducemore quantitative easing to stimulate the U.S. economicrecovery. This would weaken the dollar, favoring U.S. exportersand boosting growth, but it would also encourage investors toborrow cheap dollars and pour them into higher-yielding assetsin countries with high interest rates, such as Brazil. Scores of countries, most recently Japan and Colombia, haveresponded by trying to weaken their own currencies to defendtheir exporters. "It's a global problem," said Raphael Martello, an analystwith Tendencias consultancy in Sao Paulo. "The biggest fear isthat you will have various central banks in a race, all tryingto weaken their currencies." Brazil has already been increasing its dollar purchases inan effort to weaken the real, calling two auctions in the spotmarket every day since Sept. 8 rather than just one, and buyingas much as $1 billion a day. The government could also use the sovereign wealth fund tobuy dollars or intervene in the futures market via derivativescalled reverse currency swaps, as it has threatened to do. Another hot topic of debate is how many companies will tryto raise funds in the wake of the Petrobras deal, which hasalready satiated investors' appetites. "Many local companies have been putting off their issuanceplans," says Marjorie Hernandez, a currency strategist at HSBCin New York. "Once the Petrobras deal is completed, we see nowrising probabilities that other IPO deals could be announced,adding upside risks for the Brazilian real." But it will be a few months before these companies ventureback to the market, says Reginaldo Galhardo, head of currencytrading at Treviso brokerage in Sao Paulo. "There are manycompanies who abandoned their plans for the rest of this yearand even then, it wasn't such a huge number anyway." He sees the real trading between 1.75 and 1.78 in theaftermath of the Petrobras capitalization. In the meantime, investors are in for a busy few days asthe share offering squeezes its way through the market. The main reason for the currency volatility is that no oneknows what portion of the funds raised will be from foreigninvestors and how much of this cash is already in Brazil. Estimates vary widely because this money is coming in viaso many different brokerages due to the offering's sheer size.The most popular bet is about $25 billion of foreign funds. Data on dollar inflows released earlier this week suggestsinvestors have already converted a lot of these dollars. In the first half of September, $11.1 billion was broughtin -- more than three times the amount of cash that poured intoBrazil throughout the rest of 2010. Analysts estimate that up to half of foreign investment inthe Petrobras offering is yet to come in. That creates a riskthat the central bank could hold three or more auctions onFriday or Monday to soak up the excess dollars, analysts said. It would be the first time since 2004 that the bank hasheld more than two auctions to buy dollars on the same day. Brazil's Finance Minister Guido Mantega vowed last weekthat the authorities would soak up every single dollar thatcame in because of the deal. "We'll buy it all!" he said. Butrecent central bank data shows that has not yet happened. "It's not that the central bank isn't trying but there arelimits," said an economist at Sao Paulo's BGC Liquidezbrokerage.
