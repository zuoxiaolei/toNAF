<raw><![CDATA[ * Trade surplus 17.3 bln SEK in June vs 9.7 bln in May * Exports rise sharply vs May, helped by more working days * Analysts say an upbeat sign for Q2 GDP on Friday  (Adds detail, background, analyst comment) By Niklas Pollard and Oskar von Bahr STOCKHOLM, July 27 (Reuters) - Sweden's trade surplus nearlydoubled in June from the previous month on the back of a surgein exports, data showed on Monday, spurring recovery hopes aheadof GDP figures due later this week. Sweden's trade surplus surged to 17.3 billion Swedish crowns($2.31 billion) in June from an upwardly revised 9.7 billion themonth before, the statistics office said. The global economic downturn spawned by the financial crisishas pummelled Sweden's large export industry in recent quarters,sending companies such as world number two truckmaker Volvoracing to scale back production and cut costs. But a weak Swedish crown has provided some relief for theNordic country's heavyweight exporters, most of whom have themajority of their sales in euros or dollars but a greater shareof costs in crowns. Statistics office SCB said goods exports equalled 91.1billion crowns in June, up from 78.4 billion in May but wellbelow the 103.1 billion posted in the year-ago month. "The figures were clearly better than expected. It isexports that are the main reason for the improvement which isquite broad," Swedbank analyst Knut Hallberg said. "It's looking a bit better for the companies, and that isconsistent with the increased optimism we have seen in, amongother things, PMI (the Purchasing Managers' Index). It iscertainly also the crown effect, that we have an increase insales."  BOON TO GDP The annual rate of decline in exports slowed in June andwhile this was due in part to a larger number of working days,it still boded well ahead of second-quarter gross domesticproduct (GDP) figures later this week, analysts said. "It was surprisingly strong and it changes the conditionsfor the GDP figure that is due on Friday," Nordea analystTorbjorn Isaksson said. "It's important input ahead of GDP, which in turn isimportant for the Riksbank. The development of economic activityand GDP and resource utilisation are key right now for when wewill see a rate hike." Second-quarter GDP figures due on Friday are expected toshow the Swedish economy posted a new record fall in the secondquarter, hit by falling exports. A Reuters poll of 17 economists last week showed the economywas seen having contracted 6.6 percent from a year earlier and0.4 percent from the prior quarter. Handelsbanken chief economist Jan Haggstrom said the tradedata on Monday meant GDP was likely to fall less than feared. "We may certainly see it come in half a percentage pointstronger than we had expected if you look at foreign trade inisolation. We had expected GDP to contract 6.5 percent, but thedecline may come in below 6 percent," he said.
