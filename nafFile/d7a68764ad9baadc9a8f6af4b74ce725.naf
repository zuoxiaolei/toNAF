<raw><![CDATA[ By Jon Herskovitz	 JOHANNESBURG, April 13 (Reuters) - In terms of its economicmight, South Africa hardly deserves a seat at the table when theleaders of the BRIC group of major emerging economies meet thisweek in China.	 But the country, which is making its debut at the summit,has earned a spot politically as the stepping stone to thequickly emerging states of sub-Saharan Africa, which helpsexpand the geographic reach of the original BRIC states --Brazil Russia, India and China.	 "This is a diplomatic achievement for South Africa, not aneconomic one," said Anne Fruhauf, an analyst for Africa for theEurasia Group.	 South Africa, with a $285 billion economy, a much smallerpopulation and tepid growth of about 3 percent, pales incomparison to the four emerging market giants. 	 Its economy is less than a quarter of the size of Russia's,which is the smallest in the original grouping. While it may bethe largest in Africa, it is only a bit bigger than China'ssixth-richest province.	  South Africa lobbied China, its biggest trade partner andone of the most influential states in southern Africa, for entryinto the grouping, seeing an invitation to the club as a way todistinguish itself from the pack of second-tier emergingeconomies. 	 "It is a historic moment for South Africa," President JacobZuma said on Wednesday when he arrived in China for the summit.	 Jim O'Neill, the chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Managementwho coined the BRIC concept in 2001, has said South Africa doesnot belong in the grouping, while others have suggested thatIndonesia, South Korea or Turkey, all with larger economies thanSouth Africa, would be a better fit.    	 But South Africa helps bridge "South-South" trade and expandthe grouping's influence as a counterbalance to the establishedGroup of Seven major economies that mostly represent NorthAmerica and Europe.	 "What the G7 was for the old world, BRICS is for the new andto make it more representative, of course there has to be anAfrican economy there to speak for the developing world," saidMartyn Davies, a specialist on Africa-China economic relationsand chief executive of Frontier Advisory.	  COMMODITIES	 South Africa and southern Africa also offer the originalBRIC states something that they desperately need -- commoditiesto feed their economic engines.	 India, Brazil and China have been working hard to increasetrade with Africa. Brazil mining giant Vale plans toinvest $15-$20 billion within the next five years in Africa andits oil company Petrobras plans to invest $3 billionin Africa through 2013.	 China forged partnerships with many African states decadesago in their liberation struggles to end colonial rule and laterinvested in roads, schools, power plants and infrastructure tohelp the countries grow -- helping it import more minerals.	 As Africa has grown, so has trade with China, which leapt to$126.9 billion in 2010 from about $10 billion in 2000, China'sstate news agency Xinhua reported.	 But major BRIC fund managers appear not to have bought intothe idea that South Africa belongs in the grouping. None of themhas allocated significant assets from their portfolios into thecountry after it was invited to join the grouping in December of2010.	 Andre Roux, the co-head of Fixed Income at Investec Assetmanagement, said South Africa is not of the same class of theoriginal BRIC states in terms of an investment opportunity.	 "What we are beginning to see is the evolution of anemerging market block," Roux said, adding the group willeventually include states such as Indonesia, Turkey and Mexicoand will seek common views on economic policy issues.	 One advantage South Africa offers for the BRICS comes fromits strong links to the economies of the regional group SADC --the Southern African Development Community -- which is made of15 states with a total GDP of $471 billion and a population of257 million.	 It includes fast growing economies such as Angola, one ofAfrica's biggest oil producers, Botswana, the world's biggestdiamond producer, Mozambique, home to some of the world'slargest untapped coal reserves and Zambia, the continent'sbiggest copper producer. 	 "South Africa's entry has definitely given the BRICS a voicein the African continent," B.R. Deepak, a professor of ChineseStudies at India's Doon University wrote in a note for the SouthAsia Analysis Group.		 (Editing by Alex Richardson)	              ]]></raw>
