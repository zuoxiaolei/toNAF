The yen hit a five-month high against the dollar this weekand surged to two-month highs against the euro and Australiandollar as investors unwound bets in riskier assets that theymade using the low-yielding Japanese currency. It lost a chunk of those gains on Thursday but then held itsground as the other currencies lost momentum and S&P stockfutures signalled a weak start to Wall Street later. "It's back to the risk aversion story, in which the dollarand yen gain," said Christian Lawrence, currency strategist atRBC Capital Markets. The yen gained in particular this week as the dollar'sstatus came under scrutiny, although reaction was muted to callsfrom China for a review of the reserve currency system at ameeting of world leaders on Thursday. By 0912 GMT, the euro was 0.8 percent lower at $1.3905. Thecommon currency was down 1.1 percent against the yen at 128.85yen. European shares were down 0.1 percent. The dollar index, which tracks performance against a basketof six major currencies, was up 0.6 percent at 80.357. The dollar was down 0.3 percent at 92.64 yen.  SWISSIE EYED The European Central Bank and euro zone national centralbanks bought 23 million euros' worth of covered bonds under the60 billion euro programme launched this week, the ECB said onFriday. The programme is aimed at boosting lending to stimulatethe ailing economy. The Swiss franc edged lower after Swiss central bank chiefJean-Pierre Roth said in an interview published on Friday theSwiss National Bank was sticking "decidedly" to its policy toprevent an appreciation of the Swiss franc. The dollar gained 1.0 percent on the day to 1.0898 Swissfrancs while the euro rose 0.1 percent to 1.5142 francs. "Roth's comments suggest that the central bank is stillcommitted to its current FX intervention strategy but it doesappear that shades of optimism are returning and deflationarypressures may be easing," said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategistat UBS. "But the SNB is not wishing to appear complacent duringthis phase of the cycle." Sterling also edged lower against the dollar after risingthe previous day partly after the Bank of England surprisedmarkets by not using the remaining 25 billion pounds availableunder the current asset-buying programme. It has said it wouldreview the programme in August when it releases new quarterlyforecasts. Sterling fell 0.3 percent on the day to $1.6278. (Editing by David Stamp)             ]]></raw>
