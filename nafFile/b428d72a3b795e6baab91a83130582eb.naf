<raw><![CDATA[   * Colombian currency recovers week's sharp losses * Brazil's real adds 0.7 pct, Mexican peso up 0.3 pct (Adds comments and updates prices) By Jack Kimball and Samantha Pearson BOGOTA/SAO PAULO, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Colombia's peso surgedin volatile trading on Wednesday, bouncing back from previouslosses after a scarcity of dollars on the local marketexaggerated end-of-year moves. The rest of Latin America's major currencies eked out moremodest gains as investors looked to take on riskier positionsheading into 2011. For details, see [ID:nN29277900]. Colombia's peso  jumped 5.2 percent to 1937 to thedollar, erasing this week's sharp losses, which had taken it toits weakest level in about 8 months. The country's central bank has been steadily buying dollarson the local market in an effort to curb the peso's recentappreciation and protect exporters. But the scarcity of dollarshas prompted volatile trading this week as investors try tosettle their books in a thinly traded market. "We've been seeing the same factor in the last few days andthat is the cash position. Here in Colombia we're not allowedto have a negative position at the end of the day and peoplewere short on dollars," said Camilo Perez, head of economicresearch at Banco de Bogota. Perez said the entry of some offshore players and somefirms selling dollars -- although the quantities were notsubstantial -- helped reverse the weakening of the peso earlierthis week. Colombia's strong economic fundamentals should continue topush the peso to even stronger levels, said Benito Berber, ananalyst at Nomura Securities in New York. This week's sharp losses were a result of a temporarysqueeze in the local market, he said, adding that it was aperfect moment to buy the Colombian peso against the U.S.dollar. "In a couple of weeks when people return from holidays,people will take advantage of (the peso at cheap levels) andthe situation will normalize. It's already started to happentoday," he said. The Brazilian real  closed 0.71 percent stronger at1.678 reais per U.S. dollar on the local spot market butvolumes were extremely low. The Mexican currency  strengthened 0.25 percent to12.3644 per dollar. The Chilean peso  firmed 0.19 percentto 468.80 per dollar as the price of copper, the country's mainexport, hit another record high.[ID:nLDE6BS0KV] (Editing by Dan Grebler)             ]]></raw>
