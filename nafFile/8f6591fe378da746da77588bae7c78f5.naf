<raw><![CDATA[ * Consumer protection body says USAPEEC assurance not enough * Russia animal protection body says no decision taken yet * Spat comes as poultry imports resume after ban  (Adds comments from second watchdog) By Aleksandras Budrys MOSCOW, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Russia may take action againstimports of U.S. poultry unless it receives more assurance thatthe birds are not contaminated with salmonella, the head ofconsumer protection watchdog RosPotrebNadzor told RIA newsagency on Wednesday. The USA Poultry and Egg Export Council on Tuesday assuredRussia that U.S. poultry is safe and not affected by thesalmonella outbreak that has forced the recall of more than ahalf billion U.S. table eggs.But RosPotrebNadzor's Gennady Onishchenko said this was notsufficient. "We would like to receive an official response from the U.S.Agriculture Ministry as a state entity authorised to respond tothe Russian side," he said. Failing that, the watchdog retainsthe right to take "adequate measures", RIA reported. Russia recently began accepting U.S. poultry after banningit for much of the year, because the use of a chlorinedisinfectant violated its food safety policy. U.S. producersshipping to Russia now use a different disinfectant. Alexei Alexeyenko, a spokesman for the RosSelkhozNadzoranimal and plant health watchdog, told Reuters that so far therehad been no decision to suspend the imports again. "We have not taken any decision yet. We are assessing therisks," he said. "We are very happy that we are cooperating constructivelywith U.S. businesses. They have provided us with documents thatpermitted the reopening of exports. What we are not happy aboutis that the U.S. government has failed to provide us with statemeat safety guarantees," Alexeyenko added. When asked if Onishchenko's RosPotrebNadzor consumerprotection watchdog was in a position to block exports, he said:"Theoretically, yes. Like in the chlorine wash case". The safety responsibilities of the two watchdogs overlap insome cases, such as certain foodstuffs, including poultry meat.
