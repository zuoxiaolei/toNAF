<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar resumes falls after brief recovery * Equity gains support riskier currencies, weigh on dollar * Kiwi up on RBNZ Bollard's comments; sterling up before BoEmins  (updates pricew, adds quotes, changes byline, dateline; pvsTOKYO) By Jessica Mortimer LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The dollar edged lower againstthe euro and higher-yielding currencies on Wednesday as a briefrecovery from a 14-month low versus a currency basket fizzledout, helped by equity market gains which encouraged risk-taking. The greenback had earlier stabilised as investors bookedprofits on recent sharp gains in higher-yielding and perceivedhigher risk currencies. Failure by the euro to test the key$1.50 level also buoyed the U.S. currency. The dollar's recovery was unconvincing, however, withsentiment towards it still downbeat on the prospect of U.S.interest rates staying at exceptionally low levels for longerthan most other major countries. The New Zealand dollar shone after New Zealand's centralbank chief Alan Bollard said a strong currency was notnecessarily an obstacle to raising the cash rate.. "The dollar's carry disadvantage is working to prevent anysignificant dollar recovery," said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head offoreign exchange research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. "Euro/dollar failed to break through $1.50 yesterday, butthe downside in the pair is limited and we cannot rule outanother attempt at that level". He added, however, that there were concerns the dollar'sfalls were starting to look a little overstretched, given thatit has dropped to multi-month lows against a range of currenciesrecently. At 0741 GMT, the euro was up 0.1 percent against the dollarcompared with late New York trade at $1.4957, having hit a14-month high of $1.4994 the day before. The dollar index fell 0.3 percent from late New York levelsTO 75.338, though it stayed above a 14-month low of 75.103 hiton Tuesday. Among higher-yielding currencies, the Australian dollar rose0.4 percent to $0.9273, while the New Zealand dollar jumpednearly 1 percent to $0.7561 in the wake of the the Reserve Bankchief Bollard's comments. Investor appetite for buying perceived riskier currencieswas lifted as European share rose 0.3 percent, close to one-yearhighs, as investors more corporate results from companies suchas Morgan Stanley and Boeing. This helped lift sterling to a one-month high above $1.65against the dollar ahead of the release of the Bank of Englandminutes of its latest policy meeting at 0830 GMT. Investors will be looking for clues on whether or not thebank will extend quantitative easing. Hints of an extensioncould pressure sterling. Jitters remained, however, that policymakers outside theUnited States may increasingly express disquiet about thestrength of their currencies against the sliding U.S. dollar.  On Tuesday, the Bank of Canada killed talk of an early ratehike, warning that favourable economic developments were beingundermined by the Canadian dollar's strength and sending thecurrency down sharply.   France expressed concern about euro strength on Tuesday.  "Despite calls at the G20 level for greater FX flexibility,one risk is for countries to become impatient over the strengthof their own currencies," ING currency strategists said in anote. San Francisco Federal Reserve President Janet Yellen,however, added weight to the view that U.S. rates will stay lowfor some time, saying on Tuesday the time for tightening in theUnited States was still several months away      (Reporting byJessica Mortimer, editing by Nigel Stephenson)             ]]></raw>
