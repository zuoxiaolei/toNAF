Britian’s contribution to the bailout package for Ireland is expected to reach about GBP7 billion. British banks, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, have extensive liabilities in Ireland. However, Mr. Osborne insisted the offer to help was not based on fears about the health of U.K. banks.Meanwhile, the pound was up against the euro, with EUR/GBP shedding 0.30% to hit 0.8514.Later Tuesday, the U.S. was to publish revised figures on third quarter GDP as well as data on existing home sales and manufacturing.
