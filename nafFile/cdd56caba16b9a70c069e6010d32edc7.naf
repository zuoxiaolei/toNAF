<raw><![CDATA[ * Obama outlines steps to address airport security * Analysts see opening for Republican criticism (Recasts, adds analysts' comments) By Jeff Mason KAILUA, Hawaii, Dec 28 (Reuters) - President Barack Obamaassured Americans on Monday the United States will defeat thosebehind an attempt to blow up a U.S. airliner and sought toblunt criticism that his response to the incident was slow. Obama, who is on vacation in Hawaii, made his first publicstatement about Friday's failed attempt to down a plane overU.S. soil, promising to track down anyone connected to it. "The American people should be assured that we are doingeverything in our power to keep you and your family safe andsecure during this busy holiday season," Obama told reporters. "A full investigation has been launched into this attemptedact of terrorism, and we will not rest until we find all whowere involved and hold them accountable," he said. Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, is charged withattempting to blow up a Northwest Airlines plane as itapproached Detroit on a flight from Amsterdam with almost 300people on board. A wing of al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the failedChristmas Day attack. Abdulmutallab has told U.S. investigators that the group'soperatives in Yemen supplied him with an explosive device andtrained him on how to detonate it, officials said. Obama outlined the steps he had directed to be taken sincethe incident, including enhancing security screening for allflights and adding federal marshals to planes departing andentering the United States. He also ordered a review of a watch system to identifydangerous individuals before they travel and a review of travelscreening policies and procedures. "We do not yet have all the answers about this latestattempt, but those who would slaughter innocent men, women andchildren must know that the United States will ... do more thansimply strengthen our defenses," Obama said. OPEN FOR CRITICISM Analysts said the president, a Democrat, had opened himselfto criticism through his administration's response to theincident. Republicans question whether the administration isdoing enough to contain security threats. "He gets out front on a lot of issues, but he doesn't seemto be out front on this," said Terry Madonna, director ofFranklin & Marshall College's Center for Politics and PublicAffairs in Pennsylvania, referring to Obama. Madonna said he thought the president's reaction could hurthis standing with moderate and independent voters. "When there is a botched security incident that wasextremely serious, Republicans have an opening to criticizingthe administration for being responsible, and many Republicanswill take that opportunity," said Julian Zelizer, a professorat Princeton University in New Jersey. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano admittedon Monday that the incident represented a failure of thesecurity system. On Sunday she insisted that the system inplace to protect air travel had worked. "Obama has to handle this with care, and Napolitano'sinitial response was not a good one," Zelizer said. Obama, dressed in a coat but no tie, said he ordered thereview of airline screening to see how Abdulmutallab had madeit onto a plane with explosive material and to determine whatother steps were needed to prevent future attacks.
