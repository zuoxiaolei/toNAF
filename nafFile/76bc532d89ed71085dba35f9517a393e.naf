<raw><![CDATA[ * Stocks fall on economy worries * Wall Street set for modest gains * G20 meeting in focus, dollar rises  By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - Worries about the fragility ofglobal economic recovery hit financial markets again on Friday,knocking world stocks down for the fourth session in a row aheadof a summit of Group of 20 nations. The dollar gained slightly and the euro slipped. Wall Streetlooked set to open moderately higher. Investors have pulled back a bit from riskier assets thisweek as evidence built that economic growth, particularly in theUnited States, may be slowing. This has combined with fears that the spending cuts and taxrises being promulgated by European governments to cut debt willhurt the recovery. G8 leaders meeting on Friday in Canada -- turning into theG20 on Saturday -- are set to grapple with this issue withWashington warning against cutting too far and too fast. "The cohesion generally evident among policymakers indealing with the global crisis is in danger of giving way to amore divisive debate about how to manage the recovery," CreditAgricole analysts said in a morning note to clients. MSCI's all-country world index was down 0.4 percent, headingfor a 3 percent weekly loss. Its emerging market counterpart was down 0.7 percent. European shares turned negative after initially bucking thetrend. The FTSEurofirst 300 was down 0.4 percent adding to threeprevious days of losses. "No one is really wanting to take any big positions ahead ofthe G20," said Justin Urquhart Stewart, director at SevenInvestment Management. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average fell 1.9 percent.  DOLLAR FIRMER The dollar was up slightly against a basket of majorcurrencies and gains against the euro. The European currency was down a third of a percent at$1.2293 with funding concerns raising some jitters as banks needto repay some 442 billion euros in one-year loans to theEuropean Central Bank next week. "A little bit of risk aversion is creeping in, equitymarkets are under pressure," said Ian Stannard, senior currencystrategist at BNP Paribas. "We believe the euro is stillvulnerable." Core euro zone government bonds struggled to make furtherheadway after three consecutive sessions of gains drove futuresto two-week highs. But losses were limited by falls on stockmarkets.
