<raw><![CDATA[ * U.S. data in focus, especially Friday's jobs report * Optimism on U.S. economy continues to support dollar * Dollar hits 4 mth high vs yen, then pares gains  (Updates prices; changes byline, dateline) By Jessica Mortimer LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The dollar dipped, coming off anearlier four-month high against the yen on Monday but remainedbroadly supported on growing optimism about the prospects for aU.S. recovery which has pushed up U.S. government bond yields. The euro also gained some support as purchasing managers'surveys confirmed that euro zone manufacturing activity expandedat its fastest rate in 21 months in December  Investors were focused on U.S. data this week, starting withMonday's ISM manufacturing survey at 1500 GMT and culminating inFriday's key U.S. monthly jobs data, which could give furtherreason to believe the U.S. is on the road to recovery. Higher longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields underpinned thedollar, particularly against the yen, traders said, withbenchmark Treasury yields rising above 3.9 percent on Thursday,in sight of last year's high around 4 percent. However, traders said the dollar's upside against the yenwas capped by Japanese exporters' selling. "Data in the U.S. will be watched closely, starting with theISM data today, and any strength will help support the dollar,"BNP Paribas currency strategist Ian Stannard said. "We have U.S. yields moving higher too, which issignificant, particularly for dollar/yen," he said. By 0913 GMT, the dollar was trading down 0.2 percent at92.82 yen, though it stayed close to an earlier four-month highof 93.22 yen on trading platform EBS. Traders said the yen may face resistance heading towards its200-day moving average around 93.60 yen. The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performanceagainst six other major currencies, dipped 0.1 percent to77.753, though it was not far off a four-month high of 78.449. The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.4341. The single currency fell earlier as low as $1.4257 on EBS,testing a key chart support level around $1.4229 where the200-day moving average sits, and in sight of December's low of$1.4218. "The market is keeping to the trend set at the end of lastyear, which is to buy the dollar," said Hiroshi Maeba, executivedirector of FX trading at Nomura Securities. "But a steady recovery in the U.S. economy is not warrantedand there is still a strong possibility that the dollar willresume falling if the employment numbers are worse thanexpected," Maeba said. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Sunday theeconomy is only now recovering from recession, but he expressedconfidence that the Fed has a "robust strategy" to enable it totap the brakes at the right time.Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn went further, saying the Fedwould need to "begin withdrawing extraordinary monetary stimuluswell before the economy returns to high levels of resourceutilization," he said. The U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday is expected toshow U.S. employers cut 20,000 jobs in December, according toeconomists polled by Reuters, after the economy shed a muchlower-than-expected 11,000 jobs in November. Data released last week showed the number of U.S. workersfiling new applications for jobless benefits unexpectedly fellin the week ending Dec. 26 to the lowest level in about 17months.
