<raw><![CDATA[ * Says gained market share during crisis * 2009 net profit falls 20.2 pct to 467 mln Swiss francs * Forecast was for 506 mln francs * Makes 35 million francs provision for competition case  (Adds analyst comment, background, updated shares) By Catherine Bosley ZURICH, March 1 (Reuters) - Swiss logistics group Kuehne &Nagel bet on its growing market share and recovering worldfreight volumes to post double-digit growth this year. Kuehne said on Monday profit last year dropped by 20percent, worse than expected, hit by a slump in global trade,the strength of the Swiss franc and provisions for legal costsin a U.S. competition case. But it was well positioned for an economic upswing andexpected volumes in air and sea freight to rise 5-6 percent. "Our aim is profitable growth above market average in allbusiness units," chief executive Reinhard Lange said. "If one disregards the exceptional charge, the numbers, theproposed dividend, the increased market share and the (somewhatvague) outlook look solid," bank Wegelin said in a note. Shares in Kuehne, which competes with Panalpina and DeutscheBahn's Schenker, were 0.3 percent higher by 1316 GMT at 97.70francs a share, compared with a 0.7 percent rise in the Swissmid-cap index. Apart from an investigation by U.S authorities, Kuehne,along with some of its rivals, has also been charged by theEuropean Commission with illegally fixing prices for air freightforwarding. "We see it as very positive that the U.S. anti-trust problemis likely to be solved with a 35 million franc settlement," bankBerenberg said. "The European part is still missing and themagnitude remains unclear." Kuehne's net profit for 2009 was 467 million francs.Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the group to post netprofit of 506 million. The group trades at around 17 times forecast 2011 earnings,a premium to Panalpina at 14 times. ($1 = 1.077 Swiss francs)  (Editing by David Cowell)             ]]></raw>
