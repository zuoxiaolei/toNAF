<raw><![CDATA[ (updates, adds quotes, background) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - It would be sensible for Mexico tokeep its flexible credit line with the International MonetaryFund (IMF) -- either partially or fully -- while world financialmarkets remain volatile, the country's Deputy Finance MinisterAlejandro Werner said on Friday. "Given that our level of international reserves was deemedinsufficient by the market and given there are still significantrisks in the world economy, that may trigger bouts of volatilityas we have seen in the last five days, it will be sensible tomaintain the flexible credit line," he told Reuters. "The most important analysis we are doing is whether we willbe asking the IMF for a 100 percent access (to the credit line)or something slightly lower than that," Werner said. Mexico's finance minister and central bank governor havesaid in recent weeks that the country would seek to extricateitself from the credit line which was provided last March amidthe global financial meltdown. But Werner said: "In terms of international capital marketvolatility we are not out of the woods yet. I think the IMFdesigned a very useful instrument which was very useful to theMexican economy throughout 2009. I think it's prudent tomaintain that instrument in 2010." He said the decision would be announced sometime in the nexttwo months. Werner said also it was vital to boost Mexico's currencyreserves pile from current levels above $91 billion. The centralbank has, since October 2008, sold almost $32 billion to forexmarkets. "It is hard to pinpoint an optimal level of reserves but atthe peak of the crisis investors felt it was insufficient. So weare starting from the presumption that a higher level isdesirable," he added. Mexico, Latin America's second largest economy, is only juststarting to emerge from its worst slump in decades and theeconomy is expected to have contracted 7 percent last year. But while analysts predict gross domestic product to grow by3 percent in 2010, the government has so far stuck to aconservative 3 percent estimate. Werner said the 3 percent forecast would likely be revisedupwards but the government would prefer to wait for more databefore amending the number. "Initial data suggests that the behaviour of the Mexicaneconomy ... could allow growth to be stronger than 3 percent,"he earlier told investors. About 80 percent of Mexico's non-oil exports go to theUnited States, making the economic recovery reliant on fragileU.S. consumer demand. Werner added that foreign direct investment into Mexico islikely be over $15 billion this year, estimating last year'sfull-year inflows around $12 billion. This is however much lowerthan the $22.5 billion received in 2010.             ]]></raw>
