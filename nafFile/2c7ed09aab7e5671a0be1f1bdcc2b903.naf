<raw><![CDATA[ * Geithner says not satisfied with China currency progress * No comment on what steps US should take next * Says U.S. economy healing but growing fast enough BEIJING, Sept 13 (Reuters) - China has made "very, verylittle" progress on letting the exchange rate of the yuan reflectmarket forces, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said inremarks published in the Wall Street Journal on Monday. In an interview conducted on Friday, Geithner was asked if hewas satisfied with China's progress on the yuan. He replied: "Ofcourse not." "China took the very important step in June of signaling thatthey're going to let the exchange rate start to reflect marketforces. But they've done very, very little, they've let it movevery, very little in the interim. It's very important to us, andI think it's important to China, I think they recognize this,that you need to let it move up over a sustained period of time." Geithner is due to testify before the House ofRepresentatives Ways and Means Committee on Thursday to presentthe Obama administration's latest view of what the United Statesshould do to press China to reform its exchange rate practices. In the transcript of his comments posted online by the WallStreet Journal, he did not address that issue. The transcript isavailable athttp://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/09/12/qa-geithner-on-the-economy-tax-cuts-and-china/ . Geithner's Treasury Department, in three semi-annual reportssince President Barack Obama took office, has declined toformally name China a currency manipulator. Commenting on the state of the U.S. economy, he said it was"healing" but overall growth and job growth were not as fast asthe administration would like. The yuan has risen 0.84 percent since June 19, when the PBOCannounced the abolition of a two-year peg to the dollar. (Editing by Ken Wills)             ]]></raw>
