<raw><![CDATA[ March 8 (Reuters) - European nations have agreed a 3.5billion euro ($4.8 billion) bailout for the Airbus A400Mmilitary transporter after a raft of technical problems anddelays. Following are the amounts to be invested by each country,based on a pro-rata share of the cost overrun and details of theoriginal contract contained in a recently leaked audit report, adraft of which was obtained by Reuters.  PRICE SUPPORT Nations have awarded Airbus parent EADS a roughly 10 percentprice increase worth a total of 2 billion euros. The table shows the amount pledged by each nation accordingto their proportionate share of the project and assuming fulldelivery of the planes ordered. (In practice, some nations maychoose to fund their contribution by applying the old budget tofewer deliveries, thus reducing the cost per plane. This wouldpostpone a decision on how to fund the last few planes):                   Planes     Original   Implied     Share of                  ordered    cost       increase     project                             (million eur)  (million eur)  (percent) Germany            60        6,398        667         33 France             50        5,331        556         28 Spain              27        2,879        300         15 Britain            25        2,666        278         14 Turkey             10        1,066        111          6 Belgium             7          746         78          4 Luxembourg          1          107         11          1 -------------------------------------------------------- Total             180       19,193      2,000        100  FINANCIAL SUPPORT Nations also agreed indirect aid in the form of 1.5 billioneuros of financial suport to be repaid from future exports.
