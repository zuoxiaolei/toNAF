<raw><![CDATA[ * EU trade chief: EU states threatened on tariff votes * Urges EU voting reform to shield EU against pressure * Voting reform could be decided by this year  By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck BRUSSELS, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Some governments threaten EUmember states with retaliation unless they back their tradeinterests inside the bloc, weakening the EU's defences againstunfair competition, the bloc's trade chief has said. The statement was made in a confidential letter to aminister of an EU country, seen by Reuters on Thursday. "Exports to or investment in the third country arethreatened with retaliation if the member state does not oppose(import barriers that would harm the third country)," EU TradeCommissioner Karel De Gucht wrote in September. De Gucht's warning has stoked debate about reforming EUvoting on trade policy to give more power to Europe's centralinstitutions and less to EU capitals. EU lawmakers and government officials are discussing thereform this week and may agree on it this month. De Gucht and the reform's advocates -- among them Europe'slargest industrial sectors -- say reform is crucial to temperingthe power of foreign trading nations to lean on small EU statesto influence EU import duties. "The situation is clearly undesirable both in terms of theeffect on member state exports and investment in third countriesand in terms of the distortions it brings to EU decision-makingon trade defence measures," the letter said. Greater centralisation of power over the setting of EUimport duties "would make member states and their exports andinvestors far less vulnerable to direct and indirect lobbying".  "LIKE CLOCKWORK" Reeling from economic crisis, the EU has increased importduties on a slew of products from low-cost exporters, above allChina, leading to regular official rebukes from the EU's tradepartners but few direct measures of retaliation. But people familiar with the issue say that behind closeddoors, Europe's trade partners regularly lean on individualmember states to oppose rises in duties. "This is not something that happens once or twice, ithappens all the time. It's almost like clockwork. Licenses getrevoked, imports are delayed, exports are delayed. It makes (EU)member states nervous," said one. Current EU law gives each European state one vote to decideduty increases. Cast during closed-door meetings, the voteoutcomes -- decided on a simple majority principle -- arewatched closely by foreign exporters affected by the tariffs. Votes rejecting duties -- whether or not under foreignpressure -- have resulted in downward adjustments of Europe'sdefensive duties, or strict time limits being set. Drafts of the voting reform seen by Reuters would largelyeradicate the one-country-one-vote system despite capitals'opposition and hand more power to the Commission.  "Eventually we will have rules in place that will help closethe door on this sort of pressure," said Adrian van den Hoven,Director for International Affairs at BusinessEurope, Europe'slargest employers' group.  "De Gucht has a point. Many third countries defend theireconomic interests, and put pressure on member states withthreats of retaliation.
