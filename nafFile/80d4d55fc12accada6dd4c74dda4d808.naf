<raw><![CDATA[ * Finmin Kan: markets should determine forex levels * Kan: job of finmin to intervene if necessary * Kan: govt must pay heed to business community * PM says govt shouldn't comment on forex * PM: Kan was talking about how business felt on yen (Adds context, background) By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto TOKYO, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Japan's new finance minister backedoff his call for a weaker yen following an apparent rebuke fromthe prime minister on Friday, saying currency levels should bedetermined by markets. Still, Naoto Kan said the government should pay heed to theviews of the country's business community, signalling that he wassticking to the view of favouring a weaker yen to boost thecompetitiveness of Japanese exports. "Currencies undoubtedly should be determined by markets," Kantold a news conference. "But I also believe that generallyspeaking, it's the finance minister's job to act against currencymoves when needed." The yen has fallen sharply since Thursday when Kan called forthe currency to weaken. It gyrated in response to Kan's latestremarks, but has otherwise dropped 1.6 percent to a four-monthlow of 93.78. Kan, 63, was named finance minister on Wednesday, replacing77-year-old Hirohisa Fujii, who stepped down for health reasons. Kan jolted markets in his first press briefing as financeminister on Thursday, saying he hoped the yen would weakenfurther and that he would work with the Bank of Japan to achievean appropriate exchange rate level. The comment stirred speculation he would be more inclined tosupport official intervention -- last seen in 2004 -- if thecurrency is deemed too high. He said many Japanese firms were in favour of having thedollar move around 95 yen. That contrasted with Fujii, who hadindicated he favoured a strong yen. It is extremely rare for a finance minister to refer tospecific exchange rate levels and Kan's comments earned a rebukefrom Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, who said on Friday thegovernment should not comment on currency rates. "The government should basically not comment on foreignexchange," he told reporters. An effort by Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan to putpoliticians, not bureaucrats, in charge of policy has opened thedoor to confusing, if not conflicting, remarks by cabinetministers on various topics, prompting criticism the government'sdecision making lacks clarity. GLOBAL CURRENCY TENSIONS Kan's yen comments may not sit well either with some ofJapan's peers in the Group of Seven, which has been promotingcurrency flexibility to try to fix global economic imbalances. Indeed, France said it would put currency imbalances at thecentre of its presidency of the G8 and G20 in 2011. "Kan understands it's not a good idea to upset the UnitedStates by giving the impression that Japan would do anything toweaken the yen. He is now trying to strike a balance, although hebelieves in a weak yen," said Masamichi Adachi, senior economistat JPMorgan Securities Japan. "He will likely try to avoid raising the spectre of currencyintervention for the time being, but if the dollar drops below 90yen, he may start making verbal warnings." The world's most developed countries have struggled toresolve currency tensions which were thrown into focus by theglobal economic crisis, despite calls at a summit meeting inPittsburgh last September for these issues to be tackled. Ironing out the imbalances -- principally huge currentaccount surpluses in countries such as China and deficits in theUnited States and elsewhere -- was seen by many economists asrequiring a weaker dollar and a stronger yuan. A weaker yen would provide some respite for Japan'sexporters, who had to deal with a yen at 14-year highs of 84.82per dollar in November. The exports industry is slowly picking up and helping theworld's second-largest economy emerge from its worst post-warrecession. Major exporters, including Honda Motor Co, havecomplained about the high level of the yen. The Bank of Japan's influential tankan corporate sentimentsurvey in December showed Japanese big manufacturers expected thedollar to be 91.16 yen on average over the six months to March. Since being named as finance minister on Wednesday, Kan hasalso faced scepticism from the bond market that he will keep astight a rein on spending as his predecessor. As national strategy minister before his appointmentWednesday, he had overseen the budget process and set fiscalpriorities. Last year, he called for a stimulative budget for the fiscalyear from April 1 to avert the risk of Japan slipping back intoanother recession. He said on Friday he was mindful of fiscal discipline whilestressing the need to balance the restoration of the country'sfiscal health with spending to support the economy. A weaker yen, high share prices and doubts about Kan'scommitment to fiscal discipline, helped send 10-year Japanesegovernment bond futures to their lowest since mid-November.
