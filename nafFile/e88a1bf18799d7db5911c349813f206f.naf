<raw><![CDATA[ BRUSSELS, April 30 (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation edged upas expected in April but remained well below the EuropeanCentral Bank's target, underlining market expectations ofunchanged ECB interest rates until 2011. Consumer prices in the 16-country currency area rose 1.5percent year-on-year, up from 1.4 percent in March, EuropeanUnion statistics office Eurostat estimated on Friday.  No monthly data or detailed breakdown was available. Thedetails will be released on May 18. In March, price rises were driven mainly by higher energycosts. The ECB wants to keep inflation just below 2 percent overthe medium term. Economists expect the bank to hold interestrates at a record low of 1 percent until next year. Separately, Eurostat said euro zone unemployment stayed flatmonth-on-month at 10.0 percent of the workforce in March, inline with the expectations of economists polled by Reuters. Eurostat estimated that 15.8 million people were jobless inthe euro area in March, 101,000 more than in February and 1.39million more than in March 2009.
