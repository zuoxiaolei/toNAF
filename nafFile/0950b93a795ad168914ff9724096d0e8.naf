<raw><![CDATA[Yen firmer on hightend risk aversion, euro close to nine-year lowsInvesting.com - The dollar slipped against the firmer yen on Tuesday as heightened risk aversion supported safe haven demand, while the euro struggled near nine-year lows amid growing expectations for further stimulus measures by the European Central Bank.EUR/USD was last down 0.22% to 1.1905, not far from the lows of 1.1851 struck on Monday, the weakest level since February 2006.The single currency touched session lows after data showing euro zone private sector activity grew at a slower pace than initially estimated in December.The Markit composite purchasing managers’ index, which measures activity in the manufacturing and services sectors in the euro area, was revised down to 51.4 in December from the preliminary estimate of 51.7. The figure was still higher than November’s reading of 51.1.The weak data added to pressure on the ECB to implement quantitative easing measures ahead of its upcoming meeting on January 22.Ongoing uncertainty over Greece’s future in the euro zone if far-left anti-austerity party Syriza won elections due to be held later this month also weighed on the single currency.The dollar slipped against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.47% to 119.05 from 119.62 late Monday.The safe haven yen was boosted by declines in global equity markets, as falling oil prices and concerns over the outlook for the euro zone economy sparked a selloff in stocks.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was at 91.79, not far from Monday’s nine-year peaks of 92.05, supported by weakness in the euro.Elsewhere, sterling was struggling near 17-month lows after data showing an slowdown in the U.K.'s dominant service sector last month underlined expectations that the Bank of England will keep rates on hold for most of 2015.GBP/USD was down 0.38% to 1.5192, not far from Monday’s lows of 1.5158, the weakest since August 2013.USD/CHF was up 0.21% to 1.0090 as weakness in the euro kept pressure on the Swiss National Bank to defend its 1.20 per euro exchange rate floor. The commodity-exposed Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars pushed higher, but remained within striking distance of multi-year lows, as a rout in global oil prices continued.AUD/USD was up 0.63% to 0.8134, NZD/USD added 0.70% to trade at 0.7738 and USD/CAD was almost unchanged at 1.1770.             ]]></raw>
