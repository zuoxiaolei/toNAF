<raw><![CDATA[ * Lower volatility, improved outlook help Asia tech stocks * Euro can't shake Greece debt doubters * HSBC stock falls 6 pct after disappointing results * Aussie dollar eases despite interest rate hike * Copper prices ease after post-Chile quake jump By Kevin Plumberg HONG KONG, March 2 (Reuters) - Asian shares climbed for athird session on Tuesday, led by tech stocks, while theAustralian dollar slipped on uncertainty about the pace offuture interest rate hikes. Major European stocks were expected to open little changed,according to financial bookmakers, with weaker commodity priceshurting resources shares and preventing markets from followingthrough on a higher Wall Street close. The euro eased against the U.S. dollar, with dealersunconvinced that Greece's fiscal crisis was close to beingresolved without an aid package from the European Union. Doubts about Greece's resolve to tackle its massive debthave grown ahead of the country's second sovereign bond salethis year, which is due later this month. Fears about the ability of a handful of European countriesto finance their growing borrowing have kept a lid on riskierassets so far this year, even though the global economicrecovery generally appears to be on track. "It is a deep-seated problem," Kimihiko Tomita, head offoreign exchange at State Street Global Markets in Tokyo, saidabout Greece's commitment to cutting its debt. "It is an example of how hard it can be to regain trustonce you lose it," he said. Lower volatility in financial markets and upbeat commentsfrom SanDisk, the biggest maker of NAND flash memory cards,lifting tech-heavy Asian share markets such as South Korea andTaiwan. Japan's Nikkei share average finished 0.5 percent higher.Strength in the tech sector won an edge over weakness inAstellas Pharma Inc, which dropped 2.1 percent after launchinga $3.5 billion hostile offer for U.S. firm OSI Pharmaceuticals The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose0.6 percent, with the information technology sector in clearcommand of the day, up 1.6 percent. After plunging 14 percent in the month to Feb 8 on worriesabout the strength of the global recovery and Greece, the indexhas retraced nearly half its losses, with international fundmanagers slowly rebuilding their exposure to the region. But clearly risks remain. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, a favourite among foreigninvestors for its exposure to China, fell 0.8 percent, led by a6.9 percent drop in HSBC's stock after Europe's biggest bankposted disappointing 2009 results. UNCERTAINTY DOWN UNDER In currency markets, the Australian dollar slipped 0.2percent to US$0.8990 despite a rate hike by the Reserve Bank ofAustralia and signals of more to come amid a surprisinglystrong recovery. This was the fourth rate increase in five RBA policymeetings, putting Australia far ahead of most other richnations where growth is tepid and rates are at 1 percent orless. Few market watchers think the RBA is done raising rates,but the pace may not be as furious as it was in the latter partof 2009. "The tightening bias is still intact, though the timing offuture rate hikes is debatable. I think they are likely to stayon the sidelines until June, after they have the latestinflation numbers and the budget in May," said Su-lin Ong,senior economist with RBC Capital Markets in Sydney. The 100-day moving average, currently at $0.9067, capped asmall rebound in the Australian dollar last month and stands asa near-term obstacle. The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.3535 about a cent above9-month lows plumbed in February, while the U.S. dollar indexrose 0.5 percent against a basket of major currencies Sterling dipped 0.4 percent to $1.4931 and was seen likelyto stay weak after tumbling to a 10-month low the previous day,hurt by worries that a UK election due in months could giveneither the opposition Conservatives nor the ruling LabourParty a parliamentary majority. Copper retreated from five-week highs hit in the previoussession as concerns over supply from Chile eased after minesthere reopened following a massive weekend earthquake. Shanghai copper futures slid nearly 2 percent and Londonprices dropped more than 1 percent, dragging the rest of thebase metals complex lower, as investors focused on the slowrecovery in global demand, highlighted by bulging stocks of theindustrial metal. Oil eased 0.2 percent to $78.57 a barrel, with the dollarstrengthening on European sovereign risk worries and forecastsfor rising U.S. crude and gasoline inventories capping prices.
