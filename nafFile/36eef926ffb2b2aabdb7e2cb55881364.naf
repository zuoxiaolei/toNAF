<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar index down 0.3 percent at 80.04 before Fed * Focus on Fed's economic outlook, possible more dissent * Euro hits session highs above $1.37 after German ZEW data * Yen pressured on speculation of more BOJ easing  By Tamawa Desai LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - The dollar dipped on Tuesdaywith markets anticipating the U.S. Federal Reserve will keeppolicy unchanged, but wary of any upside surprises. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee wasexpected to reiterate its vow to keep interest rates very lowfor an "extended period", with the market focused on the Fed'sassessment of the economic outlook. The U.S. central bank was also expected to confirm thecompletion of its purchases of mortgage-backed securities andagency debt by the end of the first quarter, but keep the optionfor further buying should conditions deteriorate. Of prime interest was whether there would be more dissenterswanting to drop the "extended period" reference after recenteconomic data showed U.S. consumers are buying more and firmsseem ready to hire again. By 1128 GMT, the dollar index, a gauge of its performanceagainst six major currencies, was down 0.3 percent at 80.044,with near term resistance seen around 80.85, its March 10 high. Another focus was whether the Fed would begin laying thegroundwork for a shift in the "extended period" language. Thevast majority of primary dealers see a change as early as April. Still, most do not see an interest rate increase until thesecond half of this year. "The market looks about right in pricing November as thestart of the Fed tightening cycle, but the prospect that excessliquidity is withdrawn earlier suggests the risk to U.S. yieldsand the dollar remains to the upside," said Chris Turner, headof FX strategy at ING. The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.3715. The single currency touched session highs against the dollarand yen after data showed German ZEW institute's economicsentiment index came in higher than expected.  EURO UPSIDE HEAVY; BOJ EYED Concerns about an immediate meltdown over Greece's massivedebt have eased as euro zone finance ministers on Monday agreedon a plan to help Greece if needed. But with little known about the plan's details, underlyingsentiment toward the euro remained cautious. "Only a complete plan, which defines not just the aidpayments but also the conditions it is linked to, the controlmechanisms and the sanctions to be taken in case the conditionsare breached, would have the potential of causing a sustainablecorrection in euro/dollar," Commerzbank analysts said in a note. Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.2 percent to 90.68 yen,while the euro gained 0.5 percent to 124.37 yen. The yen has come under pressure on speculation the Bank ofJapan is leaning towards monetary easing steps this week, butthat was partly offset as Japanese firms repatriated funds aheadof the financial year-end on March 31. The BOJ ends its two-day meeting on Wednesday and is likelyto announce more easing measures, like boosting the size orduration of special fund-pumping operations. The Australian dollar was up 0.2 percent against the dollarat $0.9160 after Reserve Bank of Australia policy meetingminutes showed it expected to keep hiking rates graduallytowards normal levels. Tensions over China's currency practices brewed after aletter by 130 U.S. lawmakers on Monday called on the Obamaadministration to get tough with Beijing, a day after ChinesePremier Wen Jiabao brushed off accusations of currencymanipulation.
