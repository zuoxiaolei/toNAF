<raw><![CDATA[ * G7 to look at how to turn G20 pledges into reality * No word yet on final communique, message on currencies * G7 still seen relevant in global recovery process (Adds details, background) By Louise Egan OTTAWA, Oct 1 (Reuters) -G7 finance ministers and centralbank chiefs meeting in Istanbul on Saturday will try to figureout how to put into practice the lofty promises endorsed by G20leaders last week, a senior Canadian finance official said onThursday. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, would notspeculate on whether the G7 group of rich nations would issue afinal communique, saying finance ministers and governors wouldmake that decision at the meeting. The G7 usually issues a final statement containing a lineon currencies, closely watched by markets. But the official noted that the G20 leaders issued a23-page communique after their summit in Pittsburgh last weekand declared the broader G20 -- which includes emerging marketpowerhouses India and China -- as the world's premier forum foreconomic co-operation, superseding the G7. That leaves littleon the G7's plate for its brief encounter in Turkey and manyargue it makes no sense to discuss currencies in the absence ofa key player, China. The official declined to say whether Canada favors astatement on currencies at the end of the meeting. FinanceMinister Jim Flaherty and Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carneyhave both expressed concern about the Canadian dollar's nearly20 percent surge against the U.S. dollar since March. Eurogroup officials meeting on Thursday will prepare ajoint message on foreign exchange volatility for their G7counterparts, EU Economic and Monetary Affairs CommissionerJoaquin Almunia told Reuters on Thursday. In the wake of the Pittsburgh summit, there has been muchspeculation and confusion over the future of the G7. Canada, which is host of the G7 next year and will alsoco-chair a G20 summit with South Korea, is pleased to see theG20 gain influence, the official said. But the G7 remains relevant, at least for now, because itcaused the global financial crisis and has a responsibility tosteer the world out of it, he said. In particular, the G7 must continue to lead in stimulatingthe global economy until recovery is ensured, in co-ordinatingexit strategies and in reforming financial regulations toprevent future crises. The Istanbul meeting will give the world's richest nationsa chance to hammer out details of the peer review process theleaders agreed to when they committed to undertake policiesaimed at a more balanced global growth pattern involvinggreater savings in the United States and greater domesticdemand in China. The Canadian official said those adjustments must be madevery gradually. (Reporting by Louise Egan; editing by Rob Wilson)             ]]></raw>
