<raw><![CDATA[ * Mandelson says agreement could be signed soon * UK, India seek more cooperation on defence manufacturing  (Adds quotes, background) By Adrian Croft LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Britain and India have reached anoutline agreement on nuclear energy cooperation and are lookingat expanding ties in defence manufacturing, British BusinessSecretary Peter Mandelson said on Thursday. "We've got an agreed text on civil nuclear cooperation. Thisis a very, very significant advance," Mandelson told reportersafter talks with Indian Commerce Minister Anand Sharma. Mandelson said the agreement was ready to be signed soon. "There's absolutely no reason why it shouldn't be signednext week. It just needs the ministerial go-ahead and it's therewaiting to be signed. We shouldn't delay it any longer," hesaid, declining to give any details of the accord. Sharma, standing beside Mandelson, also said he hoped theagreement would be signed soon. A spokeswoman for UK Trade & Investment, the Britishgovernment's trade arm, said British companies were keen tocollaborate with Indian partners in civil nuclear technology. Britain was a market leader in the sector, with UK-basedindustry earning 700 million pounds ($1.11 billion) in overseasbusiness each year and employing 80,000 people, she said. "UK nuclear equipment and services companies have a longtrack record of design, construction and management, and areparticularly experienced in the life-extension anddecommissioning of nuclear plants," she said. India and the United States signed a civilian nuclear dealin 2008, ending India's nuclear isolation since it tested anuclear device in 1974 and opening up its atomic market forfirms such as General Electric Co and Westinghouse Electric Co,a subsidiary of Japan's Toshiba Corp. But with delays in implementation of the deal, U.S. firmshave lagged in a competitive scramble with Russian and Frenchfirms whose governments guarantee their liability in case of anindustrial accident. Britain is planning to build a new generation of nuclearpowers plants at home, but will need French help to do so. Mandelson said Britain and India were seeking greatercollaboration in high-technology manufacturing, includingdefence, where he said India wanted to be "overwhelminglyself-sufficient in growing its defence manufacturing base." "We have British companies who are able and willing to helpbring that about by locating their production in India, bybringing their high technologies and knowledge and research anddevelopment to India," he said, singling out armoured vehiclesand air tankers as products where there could be cooperation.
