<raw><![CDATA[ * Seven countries to face automatic review * China says satisfied with G20 agreement * Deal not binding for member countries (Adds analyst comment) By Daniel Flynn and Wanfeng Zhou WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - Leading world economiesagreed on Friday to put the policies of seven major nationsunder a microscope as part of a plan to prevent a repeat of theglobal financial crisis. The pact was agreed by the Group of 20 nations after monthsof wrangling highlighted by China's fears that its policy oflimiting its currency's rise was being targeted. Under the deal, the International Monetary Fund will lookat national levels of debt, budget deficits and trade balancesto determine if a nation's policies are putting the globaleconomy at risk and should be changed. One potential shortcoming is that countries will not bebound to follow any recommendations that emerge. French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said theagreement marked "huge progress" on the path to more balancedworld growth and said seven major economies would automaticallybe subject to review. Others could face scrutiny as well iftheir policies are found to be stoking global risks. "The net is a little bit tighter for those countries thatare considered of systemic importance," Lagarde said. France is president of the G20 this year. Countries representing more than 5 percent of the combinedoutput of the G20 will be examined by the IMF under the deal. The list would include the debt-burdened United States andexport-rich China -- the two main economies at the heart of thedebate over global imbalances. France, Britain, Germany, Japanand India would round out the list, officials said. "Our aim is to promote external sustainability and ensurethat G20 members pursue the full range of policies required toreduce excessive imbalances," G20 finance officials said in acommunique issued at the close of a full-day meeting. Many economists say global imbalances -- notably the gapingand persistent U.S. trade gap and correspondingly large surplusin China -- laid ground for the 2007-2009 crisis, which endedwith the worst global recession since World War II. The G20 has become the main forum to prevent similarboom-bust cycles. Agreeing on how best to do that has growndifficult now that the darkest days of crisis have passed. Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institutionand former IMF official, said the real test of the latest planfrom the G20 rich and emerging economies will come once all thenumbers are filled in and countries have to answer for policiesthat are deemed a danger to the world. "Once the numbers are put on the table, that's when you'llstart to see the pushback," he said. The G20 appeared to offer room for countries to sidestepcriticism. "National circumstances will ... be taken intoaccount," it said without elaboration. It said the global recovery was strengthening but warned ofcontinued risks, including the political unrest in the MiddleEast and North Africa and the disasters in Japan. PROGRESS ON CAPITAL CONTROLS Officials also agreed to keep working on a framework fordetermining when countries can use controls over capitalinflows -- a sensitive topic for emerging market nations thatare fighting inflation stoked by "hot money" from countrieswith low interest rates, such as the United States. Brazil has resisted efforts to restrict the use of capitalcontrols. "We don't want high levels of global liquidity toturn into problems for the Brazilian economy," the country'scentral bank chief, Alexandre Tombini, said on Friday. European Central Bank Governing Council member ChristianNoyer said officials "made enormous progress" on the issue. "We do not any more have two fronts, one saying thereshould be total freedom and never any measure taken, and theother saying each country should have total faculty to dowhatever it feels necessary," he said. Policymakers from advanced economies, led by the UnitedStates, have argued that emerging nations can combat inflowsand price pressures by allowing their currencies to strengthenagainst the dollar. They say if countries such as China were todo so it would help balance world trade. Emerging nations, in contrast, blame near zero interestrates in the United States for sending investors elsewhere inthe search for returns. Despite efforts by Brazil to weaken itsreal currency, it hit a near two-year high this week. While China had been especially wary about the effort toset up a monitoring process, it welcomed the G20 accord. Chinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said theagreement "fully reflects each country's demands," including"reforming the international financial system and strengtheningfinancial regulation." "We're satisfied with the results," he said. Lena Komileva, an economist at Brown Brothers Harriman,said officials were still a long way from securing the futureof the world economy. "The global recovery has been achieved at the price of arecord U.S. budget deficit and overheating in emerging marketssuch as China," she said. "This is not a sustainable platformfor global economic stability."
