<raw><![CDATA[ * Activists challenge secretive EU trade negotiations * EU withheld details of export plans shared with industry * Commission says needs to protect foreign relations   (Adds comment from European Commission) By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck BRUSSELS, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Transparency campaigners suedthe European Union's executive on Tuesday for withholdingdocuments on trade talks with India, stepping up pressure on thebloc to make its policymaking less secretive. The lawsuit, lodged with the EU's second-highest court,accuses the EU Commission of breaking transparency and democracyrules by refusing to disclose to campaigners details of plansshared with EU industry on how to open Indian markets. "Industry lobbies enjoy massively privileged access andinfluence in trade negotiations, even when there are concernsfrom other quarters that this is threatening Indian labourrights and access to medicines," said Pia Eberhardt, campaignerfor Corporate Europe Observatory, which lodged the complaint. India is expected to complete a free trade deal with the EUthis year, but activists worry a pact could limit its productionof cheap, generic HIV and anti-malaria drugs. They are also worried that opening India's retail sector tointernational supermarkets could put Indian vendors and smallshopkeepers out of business.   The case, lodged with the European General Court, focuseson the Commission's refusal over 18 months to give campaignersfull access to email exchanges and notes from meetings with EUgovernments and business groups about how to export more pork,poultry, medical equipment and car tyres to India. The Commission deleted key passages before giving the notesto the Observatory, citing rules to protect internationalrelations, according to documents obtained by Reuters. "If the Commission has already shared information with thebusiness world at large, the same information cannot suddenlybecome confidential when a public interest group asks for it,"Eberhardt said. The lawsuit says the Commission sent full notes to lobbygroups like BusinessEurope, the largest EU employers' grouping. "The European Commission is committed to working as openlyand transparently as possible and we support the public's rightto know. It is clear that all negotiations require a degree ofconfidentiality to ensure such a process can move forward," saidCommission spokesman John Clancy. The Commission regularly seeks input from industry and civilsociety, he added.  BusinessEurope was not immediately available to comment. In a handwritten note included in the suit, former EU tradechief Peter Mandelson invited BusinessEurope to share sensitiveinformation with India's main business group. The lawsuit arguesthis voids claims of confidentiality. EU institutions are under increasing pressure to lift theveil of secrecy shrouding much of their decision-making. More than 240 campaigners and journalists this month askedthe European Parliament to act against a Commission plan totighten laws on access to information. The Commission has cited the protection of internationalrelations in its refusal to reveal details of meetings betweenEU officials and representatives of European pharmaceuticalscompanies including Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline, theObservatory said.
