<raw><![CDATA[  (Adds quotes from Chinese officials, background) By Chris Buckley PITTSBURGH, Sept 24 (Reuters) - China pressed its worriesabout the stability of the U.S. dollar on Thursday, deflectingcriticism of its own currency and trade policies as G20 leadersmet to discuss issues including rebalancing the globaleconomy. Given the U.S. dollar's role as the world's primary reservecurrency, the Obama administration should not risk letting itfalter, a Chinese central bank official told a newsconference. "The stability of the U.S. dollar has a keen influence onworld economic recovery," and U.S. policy on the dollar shouldheed both domestic and international needs, said Xie Duo,director-general of the international department of thePeople's Bank of China, the nation's central bank. "We've constantly stressed to the U.S. government that wehope that in carrying out domestic currency policy and the role(of the dollar) as an international reserve currency, it shouldtake care of both of those two policy dimensions," Xie said. Washington should bear in mind the importance of the dollaras a global reserve currency when setting domestic fiscalpolicy, said Xie. Speaking to reporters in Pittsburgh earlier, U.S. TreasurySecretary Timothy Geithner addressed such worries, saying thedollar would retain its role as the world's primary reservecurrency for "a very long time." [ID:nWEN4028] Xie and other officials were speaking ahead of a day oftalks at which the G20 leaders were to discuss ways of avoidinga repeat of the financial crisis, including a possible exitplan from the burst of stimulus injected to help the globaleconomy recover.The leaders were also to discuss global economic imbalancesthat economists fear could undermine a recovery. Some economists and Western officials have said China, withexchange rate controls on its yuan currency that makes Chineseexports cheaper overseas and so enables the country toaccumulate a huge trade surplus, is an important element inthose imbalances. China has invested much of the ensuing currency reserves inU.S. Treasury securities, becoming the world's single biggestholder of them and watching uneasily as Washington spendslavishly to haul the U.S. economy out of recession. Chinese officials staking out their position for the summitturned their attention on the fiscal and trade policies ofWashington. The main global economic imbalance that should worry theG20 is the gap between rich and poor nations, Zheng Xiaosong ofthe Chinese Ministry of Finance, told the news conference. Ma Xin, an official in the National Development and ReformCommission that steers Chinese economic policy, said hisgovernment wanted the summit to begin studying how to wind downthe "extraordinary" government spending initiatives that haveshored up economic activity in the wake of the financialcrisis. He also said it was too early to abandon this stimulusspending, although inflationary risks and other worries wouldeventually demand attention and require a retreat. "We think it's too early to exit yet, because Europe, theUnited States and Japan are still in negative growth....Pullingout now would damage global economic confidence," Ma toldReuters after a news conference in Pittsburgh, host of the G20summit of major rich and developing economies. But, Ma added, "We need to consider making a plan for, orstudying, this (exit)...This can't continue for a very longtime. Now is a bit early, but we need to exit eventually." Washington and Beijing have also been at odds over Chineseexports, following President Obama's decision to impose extratariffs on Chinese-made tires. Obama imposed the tire tariffs under an anti-import surgemechanism, which Beijing fears the safeguard rule could be usedagainst other Chinese-made products.
