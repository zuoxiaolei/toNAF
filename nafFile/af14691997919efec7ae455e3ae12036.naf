<raw><![CDATA[ TOKYO, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kanwill attend a meeting of Asian and European leaders in Brusselsnext week, the top government spokesman said on Tuesday, as Tokyostruggles to find a way to repair deteriorating ties with China Japanese ruling party officials had earlier said Kan wouldskip the meeting because of an extra parliament session thatbegins on Friday. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshito Sengoku said Japanesediplomats might try to arrange a meeting between Kan and ChinesePremier Wen Jiabao, who will also attend the gathering, if theenvironment was right, but added: "The ball is in China's court." Japan's detention of a Chinese trawler captain has sparkedrenewed tentions between Beijing and Tokyo, highlighting thefragility of relations between Asia's biggest economies, althoughthe captain was released and returned home on the weekend. The spat has raised concerns about damage to Sino-Japanesetrade ties at a time when Japan is becoming increasingly relianton China's dynamism for growth. Experts have said the sudden bitter feud between Tokyo andBeijing will likely push Japan to mend ties with close allyWashington and reach out to other countries in the region thatare also wary of an increasingly aggressive Beijing. Sino-Japanese ties have long been plagued by mistrust born ofChina's bitter memories of Japan's past military aggression. But Tokyo is hardly alone in worrying about China's growingassertiveness. China claims swathes of the South China Sea, whereTaiwan and several of the 10-member Association of SoutheastAsian Nations (ASEAN) also assert sovereignty. The Nikkei business newspaper in an editorial on Tuesday,urged Kan's government to reach out to other countries that shareconcerns about China's naval activities, such as ASEAN. "We would like Prime Minister Kan to develop summit diplomacythrough the series of international gatherings that begin nextmonth," the newspaper said. Sengoku told the news conference that it was desirable formaritime disputes to be addressed in multilateral as well asbilateral forums -- a stance China has rejected. But added it wasnot clear if such matters would be on ASEM's agenda. (Reporting by Chisa Fujioka, Linda Sieg and Yoko Nishikawa;Editing by Edwina Gibbs)             ]]></raw>
