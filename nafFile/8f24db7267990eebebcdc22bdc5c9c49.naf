<raw><![CDATA[  * U.S. payrolls weaker than expected, weighing on dollar * ECB bond buying, euro-zone data underpin euro * Dollar/yen falls to 2-1/2 week low (Recasts, adds quote, U.S. data, updates prices, changesbyline; dateline, previous LONDON) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Friday afterdata showed the U.S. economy created far fewer jobs thanexpected, although persistent euro-zone debt problems may limitlosses. Labor Department data showed U.S. non-farm payrolls rose39,000 last month, much weaker than expectations for 140,000new jobs. The unemployment rate also increased to 9.8 percent.See. Many analysts viewed the weak jobs report an outlier amid aslew of generally positive U.S. data released the last fewweeks that suggest the economy is slowly gaining traction. The euro-zone debt crisis remains a drag on the singleeuro-zone currency and will keep it under pressure for sometime. European authorities may have bailed out Ireland, butinvestors are still worried about the next euro-area country torequire assistance. "A softer-than-expected jobs number probably makes people alittle more comfortable with the idea that the Fed willsteadily progress with its planned quantitative easing," saidNick Bennenbroek, head of FX strategy at Wells Fargo in NewYork."The question is, was the number so weak that it createsconcern about the economy, market volatility and risk aversion?I think probably not. It's a disappointing number, but it's notbad enough to raise concerns of a renewed recession." In early New York trade, the euro rose 0.9 percent on theday at $1.3342,, blowing past the key 100-day moving average at$1.3325 and well above a 2-1/2 month low of $1.2969 hit onTuesday. The next key level to watch is $1.3467, the 38.2 percentretracement of the euro's move from its peak at $1.4283 inearly November to the $1.2969-level trough. The euro was underpinned earlier by the fall in riskpremiums on government bonds issued by euro-zone peripherystates on Friday, with further bond buying by the EuropeanCentral Bank reassuring investors. A rise in euro-zone service sector activity, retail salesand the Bundesbank raising Germany's growth forecasts for thisyear also supported the single currency. Against the yen, the dollar fell to 2-1/2-week lows at82.53. It was last at 82.64, down 1.5 percent.             ]]></raw>
