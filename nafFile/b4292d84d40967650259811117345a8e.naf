<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was trading near one-and-a-half month highs against the Swiss franc on Tuesday as expectations for the Federal Reserve to soon scale back its stimulus program continued to support demand for the greenback.   USD/CHF hit 0.9679 during European morning trade, the pair's highest since May 29; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.9667, gaining 0.33%.   The pair was likely to find support at 0.9566, the low of July 5 and resistance at 0.9718, the high of May 24.   Demand for the U.S. dollar remained supported after data last week showed that the U.S. economy added 195,000 jobs in June, more than the 165,000 increase forecast by economists. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said last month the bank could begin tapering its USD85 billion-a-month asset purchase program by the end of 2013 if the economy picks up as the central bank expects.   In Switzerland, official data showed that retail sales rose at an annual rate of 1.8% in May, down sharply from growth of 3.1% in April. Economists had expected Swiss retail sales to rise 1.9% in May.   The Swissie was lower against the euro with EUR/CHF rising 0.36%, to hit 1.2446.   Finance ministers from the European Union were to hold talks in Brussels later Tuesday.             ]]></raw>
