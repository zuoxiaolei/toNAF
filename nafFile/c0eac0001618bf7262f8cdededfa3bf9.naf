<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds economists' comments) By Jan Strupczewski BRUSSELS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Euro zone retail sales defiedexpectations of a rebound and fell in July, pulled down mainlyby lower sales of food, drinks and tobacco in a sign consumerdemand is yet to benefit from any nascent economic recovery. Retail sales in the 16-country euro area fell 0.2 percentagainst June and dropped 1.8 percent year-on-year, the EuropeanUnion's statistical body, Eurostat, said on Thursday.[ID:nBRQ007499]. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.1 percent riseversus the previous month and a 2.2 percent fall year-on-year. Data on second-quarter euro zone gross domestic productshowed household demand contributed 0.1 percentage point to theGDP outcome in April-June, which economists attributed togovernment cash incentives for changing old cars for new ones. Some said such schemes may have diverted household fundsfrom smaller-ticket items, negatively affecting retail sales,which do not include car purchases. "It is likely that the retail sales data modestly understatethe current strength of consumer spending in the euro zone asthey do not include car sales which have been liftedsubstantially in a number of countries by 'cash for clunkers'schemes," said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. "It is possible that this is diverting some spending awayfrom retail sales," he said. Sales of food, drinks and tobacco fell 0.5 percent againstJune and were 1.8 percent lower than a year earlier. The euro zone's biggest economy, Germany, which returned togrowth in the second quarter, posted a 0.7 percent monthly risein retail sales. Economists have raised doubts about the speed andsustainability of any recovery because of high and risingunemployment, which reached 9.5 percent of the workforce in July-- the highest in more than 10 years. "Doubts and uncertainties remain about the future strengthof consumer spending across the euro zone," said Archer. "High and rising unemployment across the euro zone, mutedwage growth over the coming months, the ending of the carscrappage schemes and likely modestly rising inflation beforelong will likely weigh down on consumer spending," he said. The data comes just before the European Central Bank isexpected to keep its main interest rate at 1.0 percent andpresent new growth and inflation forecasts amid signs the worstEuropean recession since World War Two may be ending. "We see the euro zone will show positive GDP growth over thethird quarter this year and beyond. The ECB is likely to keepits refinancing rate at 1 percent until the third quarter ofnext year," said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec.
