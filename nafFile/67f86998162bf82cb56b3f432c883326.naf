<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The U.S. dollar dropped to a three-day low against the yen on Tuesday, after the Bank of Japan boosted its inflation target and committed to open-ended asset purchases. USD/JPY hit 88.89 during European morning trade, the pair's lowest since January 17; the pair subsequently consolidated at 89.03, dropping 0.65%. The pair was likely to find support at 88.14, the low of January 17 and resistance at 90.13, the session high.  Following its two-day policy meeting, the BoJ said that from 2014 it would switch to an open-ended approach of buying a certain amount of assets each month without setting a deadline for completing the purchases. The central bank had previously pledged to inject JPY101 trillion into markets with its asset-buying and lending program by the end of this year, but had made no commitment on whether to maintain the balance beyond 2014. In addition, the BoJ doubled its inflation target to 2% in an effort to rid Japan of deflationary pressures, and left interest rates close to zero, as expected. The yen was also higher against the euro with EUR/JPY shedding 0.44%, to hit 118.80. Later in the day, the U.S. was to publish private sector data on existing home sales. In addition, the World Economic Forum was to begin its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.              ]]></raw>
