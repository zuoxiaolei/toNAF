<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar hits 14-mth lows vs AUD, 15-mth lows vs CAD, NZD * Aussie boosted by RBA Stevens' hawkish comments * Stronger inflation data pushes the kiwi higher * Euro climbs to 14-month peak vs dollar By Satomi Noguchi TOKYO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a 14-month lowagainst a basket of currencies on Thursday as comments by thehead of Australia's central bank encouraged investors to buy thehigher-yielding Australian dollar, which helped other currenciesgain. The Reserve Bank of Australia chief said local interest rateswould need to move towards a more normal setting as economicrecovery took hold, reinforcing the view that the country isheading for a second straight rate hike in November. The Aussie pushed higher to a 14-month peak against thedollar above $0.92, sparking a broad dollar slide that sent theCanadian dollar to a 15-month high and the euro to its highestlevels since August 2008. The New Zealand dollar jumped to a 15-month high versus theU.S. dollar after stronger-than-expected inflation numbers raisedexpectations of a near-term interest rate hike. "The dollar's slide comes in good market conditions withstocks rising. So there is no fear involved," said Kosuke Hanao,head of treasury product sales at HSBC in Tokyo. Asian shares tracked Wall Street higher, adding to investors'appetite for riskier assets. Strong quarterly earnings fromJPMorgan Chase helped push the Dow Jones industrial average above10,000 for the first time in a year. The greenback was also under pressure after the minutes ofthe latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting suggested thatU.S. interest rates are likely to remain low for some time. The prospect of low U.S. interest rates would encourageinvestors to sell the dollar for other higher-yielding currenciesin carry trades, especially if other central banks start liftinginterest rates as their growth picks up. "Australia is ahead of other countries in taking action on anexit strategy, making the Aussie special and easy to be bought incomparison," said Shuichi Kanehira, head of forex spot trading atMizuho Corporate Bank. Traders said investors have been increasingly buying theAussie after the Australian central bank became the first in theGroup of 20 to raise interest rates last week as the globalfinancial crisis eases. The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performanceagainst six other major currencies, was down 0.3 percent at75.295. It earlier dropped as low as 75.251, the lowest sinceAugust 2008. The Aussie rose as high as $0.9218 on the Reuters dealingsystem, its highest since August 2008, before trading at $0.9215,up 0.6 percent from late New York trade. The Canadian dollar, another currency seen as linked tocommodities, rose to a 15-month high against the dollar ofC$1.0208. The kiwi rose 0.5 percent to touch a 15-month high of$0.7485. The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.4951 after hitting a14-month high of $1.4961 on trading platform EBS with traderseyeing the next target at $1.50. Some traders said the euro's strength was helped by buying byemerging economies' central banks diversifying their foreignreserves, as they have been buying the dollar to prevent theirown currencies from rising sharply. The dollar edged down 0.1 percent against the yen to 89.38yen after a brief rise earlier, while the euro rose 0.1 percentto 133.68 yen. (Editing by Michael Watson)             ]]></raw>
