<raw><![CDATA[ (Updates with Portuguese auction, adds quotes, mkt reaction) * Germany draws solid demand at two-year bond sale  * Portugal's borrowing costs fall at bill auction  * Portugal yields still seen as high  By Kirsten Donovan LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Germany sold just shy of 5billion euros worth of two-year bonds on Wednesday, meetingdecent demand after short-dated yields rose to their highest inmore than a year on warnings of higher interest rates.  Portugal's 12-month borrowing costs, meanwhile, fell sharplycompared with a treasury bill auction last month, easingpressure on the indebted country to seek a bailout after asuccessful bond sale last week. Germany, whose bonds are the euro zone benchmarks at keymaturities, drew bids for 2.1 times the amount allotted, almostdouble the demand at a December sale. That auction technicallyfailed to draw enough bids to cover the amount on offer. The average yield at Wednesday's sale was 1.17 percent, upfrom 0.92 percent last month and in line with moves on thesecondary market. "Obviously it was a very strong auction result. Nominal bidsof over 10.5 billion are the highest amount we've seen in atleast six months and a bid-cover of above two compares very wellto the 2010 average," said Michael Leister, a rate strategist atWestLB in Duesseldorf. "Taken together with tight pricing, this really indicatesstrong demand. The key reason is the high outright yieldsfollowing the Trichet sell-off at the short end which wereenough to attract the investor interest." Two-year yields have risen to their highest since thebeginning of 2010 after the market brought forward expectationsof euro zone interest rate hikes following a warning fromEuropean Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet's that thebank could take steps to contain inflation. ECB policymakers have cooled the inflation talk this week,but German two-year yields, most susceptible to interest ratechanges, remain elevated by recent standards. German 10-year Bunds sold off after the auction, but tradersattributed the move to a newspaper report that Germany wasconsidering a plan which would allow Greece to buy back its owndebt, rather than to problems digesting the new paper. Bond auctions by the region's triple-A rated issuers havemet good demand in January, supported by sizeable cash inflowsfrom coupon and redemption payments. France sells up to 9billion euros of two- and five-year bonds on Thursday.  PORTUGAL  Portugal's 12-month T-bill yield fell to 4.029 percent from5.281 percent in an auction with a similar maturity on Dec. 1,coming in slightly lower than expected and also in line with thesecondary market. The auction further bolsters the Socialist government'sdetermination to continue financing itself in debt marketsrather than following Greece and Ireland in seeking a bailout,as many economists think Portugal will eventually have to do. "This auction confirms that Portugal has still access to themarket but at high cost. Indeed, while cost of funding hassharply decreased, at the one-year maturity a yield level of4.029 percent is still very high in absolute terms," said ChiaraCremonesi, fixed income strategist at UniCredit Research. Portugal last week sold 10-year bonds at lower yields thanat a previous sale, in an auction seen as a key test of itsability to fund itself at sustainable rates. Cremonesi added that although Wednesday's auction result waslikely to reassure investors, underlying sentiment towardsPortugal remained fragile and uncertainty high.             ]]></raw>
