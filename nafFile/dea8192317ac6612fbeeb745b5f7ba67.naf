<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The pound rose to an almost eight-month high against the U.S. dollar on Friday, after weaker-than-expected data on U.S. first-quarter economic growth dampened demand for the greenback, despite ongoing concerns over the outlook for the U.K. economy.GBP/USD hit 1.6080 on Wednesday, the weekly low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.6262 by close of trade on Friday, jumping 1.14% over the week.Cable is likely to find support at 1.6108, the low of April 24 and resistance at 1.6422, the high of August 30.The Commerce Department said gross domestic product in the U.S. expanded at a rate of 2.2% in the three months to March, below expectations for a 2.5% increase.Earlier in the week, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke left open the possibility of further measures to bolster economic growth after the central bank’s monetary policy meeting, saying policymakers were “prepared to do more” if necessary.In the U.K., preliminary data on Wednesday showed that GDP contracted by 0.2% in the three months to March after contracting by 0.3% in the fourth quarter, confounding expectations for 0.1% growth.But the pound remained supported by speculation that the Bank of England will hold off on implementing further stimulus measures amid hopes that the GDP estimate may still be revised up.Meanwhile, ongoing concerns over the debt crisis in the euro zone also lent support as investors viewed sterling as a safe alternative to the euro.Overall market sentiment was boosted on Friday as a well received auction of Italian government debt eased some concerns over the euro zone, following a two-notch downgrade of Spain by ratings agency Standard & Poor’s.S&P cut Spain’s long-term credit rating to BBB+ from A and gave it a negative outlook on Thursday, saying that the recession will undermine government efforts to reduce one of the largest budget deficits in the single currency bloc.The pound hit its highest level in 22 months against the euro on Friday, with EUR/GBP shedding 0.24% to settle at 0.8148 by close of trade.In the week ahead, Friday’s data on U.S. non-farm payrolls will be eagerly anticipated amid concerns that the economic recovery in the U.S. is losing momentum.
