<raw><![CDATA[Dollar index ends week lower after FedInvesting.com - The dollar ended the week lower against a basket of other major currencies despite small gains on Friday, after the Federal Reserve indicated earlier in the week that rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.The US Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, edged up to 80.41 late Friday from lows of 80.24 on Thursday. For the week, the index lost almost 0.3%.The greenback weakened broadly after the Fed gave no indication of when interest rates could start to rise at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday. In addition, the Fed’s forecast of where interest rates might reach in the long term fell from 4% to 3.75%.The central bank cut its bond purchases by $10 billion a month, to $35 billion, saying there was "sufficient underlying strength" in the U.S. economy to continue tapering. Despite this, the Fed also lowered its forecast for growth this year to a range of 2.1% to 2.3% from 2.8 to 3.0% previously, due to "unexpected contractions" in the first quarter as a result of the unusually harsh winter.The Fed acknowledged the recent increases in inflation and drop in unemployment, but Chair Janet Yellen said no formula was in place for when interest rates would start to rise.EUR/USD dipped 0.06% to 1.3598 late Friday, but posted a weekly gain of 0.47%. The dollar pushed higher against the yen, with USD/JPY easing up to 102.07 late Friday from 101.93 on Thursday. For the week, the pair eked out a gain of 0.10%.The pound slipped lower, with GBP/USD ending Friday’s session at 1.7014, 0.15% lower for the day. For the week, the pair gained 0.22% as demand for sterling continued to be underpinned by the view that the Bank of England will raise interest rates ahead of other central banks.Elsewhere, the greenback slumped to a five-and-a-half month low against the Canadian dollar on Friday, following the release of stronger-than-forecast data on Canadian inflation and retail sales.USD/CAD was down 0.56% to 1.0757 late Friday, the weakest level since January 7.
