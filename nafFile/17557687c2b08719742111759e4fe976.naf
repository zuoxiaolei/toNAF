<raw><![CDATA[ * WHAT: BoE Inflation Report and Governor's news conference * WHEN: Wednesday, Feb. 16, 1030 GMT * Upward revision to 2011 CPI, closer to 2 pct medium term * GDP projection to be slightly lower than November  By Fiona Shaikh LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The Bank of England is likely tosmooth the way for a future rise in interest rates with itsquarterly economic forecasts on Wednesday, and try to allayconcerns that it is going soft on inflation. The central bank left borrowing costs on hold at 0.5 percentthis month, even though an estimate for January due on Tuesdayis likely to have shown that consumer prices inflation climbedto 4 percent -- double its 2 percent target. This would force BoE Governor Mervyn King to write anotherletter to finance minister George Osborne explaining theovershoot. Investors reckon the central bank may have to starttightening policy sooner rather than later to bring inflationback on track, and money markets are almost fully pricing in a25 basis point rise in borrowing costs by May. Most city economists do not expect the central bank to starttightening policy until much later this year, however,highlighting the dilemma facing policymakers of how to tacklerising price pressures without derailing the economic recovery. "Our forecast is for August, but I think there's wiggle roomin both directions, and May is looking increasingly likely,"said Alan Clarke, economist at BNP Paribas. Inflation at the end of last year already exceeded the BoE'sNovember Inflation Report forecasts, averaging 3.4 percent, andGovernor King warned in January that surging oil and commodityprices could drive CPI up to almost 5 percent. The BoE produces two forecasts for inflation -- one based onmarket interest rate expectations and one that assumes interestrates remain at 0.5 percent.  Analysts reckon that near-term inflation forecasts on bothmeasures will be revised upwards to reflect a greater knock-onimpact of rising commodity prices and value-added tax. The November forecasts envisaged inflation falling to amodal 1.45 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 based on marketrate expectations, and 1.59 percent based on unchanged policy. "For the first time in a while, assessing what happens tomonetary policy will depend on both fan charts," Clarke said.  GROWTH RISKS The BoE's outlook for growth will also play a key role indetermining when policymakers start to withdraw monetarystimulus, and so far it has maintained there is enough slack inthe economy to keep inflation in check further down the line. The central bank will almost certainly have to revise downits near-term forecasts for GDP from November because of theshock 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter decline in economic outputin the final three months of 2010. The contraction was mainly due to heavy snowfall inDecember, and there are signs that activity rebounded quickly inJanuary.  But the BoE may still have to lower its medium term outlookfor growth, lessening the urgency for the Monetary PolicyCommittee to take action on inflation.  The Bank's modal projection for year-on-year GDP growth inQ4 2010 was 3.05 percent -- almost double a first officialestimate of 1.7 percent growth. "That said, most MPC members have clearly become moreworried about the damage to credibility that is being wrought bythe persistent overshooting of the inflation target," said SimonHayes, economist at Barclays Capital. "In that case, the report will provide a vehicle to preparefinancial markets, firms and households for a rate hike,probably within the next few months."
