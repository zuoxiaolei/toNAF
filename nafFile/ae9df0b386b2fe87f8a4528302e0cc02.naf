<raw><![CDATA[ * Governor Shirakawa back from U.S. earlier than planned * Most likely option is to expand fund supply programme * BOJ could opt for other steps as govt may ask for more By Leika Kihara TOKYO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is likely to holdan emergency meeting on Monday to ease monetary policy inresponse to the yen's strength after Governor Masaaki Shirakawareturned to Tokyo from a trip to the United States earlier thanexpected. Sources had told Reuters that the BOJ was expected to hold anextra meeting early in the week to loosen policy as the strongyen threatens Japan's fragile economic recovery. The early returnof Shirakawa, who was originally expected to come back on Monday,has increased the chance of a Monday gathering. The most likely option is to expand a cheap fixed-rate fundsupply programme put in place in December, said sources familiarwith the BOJ's thinking. But there is a slim possibility the BOJ could opt for moreaggressive measures, such as increasing its government bondpurchases or cutting its overnight call rate target, as somegovernment officials are already complaining that minor tweaks tothe fund supply scheme would not be enough. The BOJ has been considering easing policy, but had initiallyhoped to wait until its Sept. 6-7 rate review for more evidenceof the harm the strong yen was inflicting on business sentiment. But the yen's climb to a fresh 15-year high on the dollarlast week and a slide in stock prices have alarmed some in theBOJ into considering action. The BOJ has also been underincreasing government pressure to ease policy. Following are some policy options for the BOJ: EXPAND FUND SUPPLY TOOL Possibility: Most likely The BOJ set up a funding scheme in December that it expandedin March, which offered up to 20 trillion yen ($234 billion) inthree-month loans at 0.1 percent. The decision to set up thescheme was made at an emergency meeting held a day beforeShirakawa met with then-Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama. That failed to boost bank lending, which marked its eighthstraight month of annual falls in July. But it helped to push theyen further away from a November high. Increasing the amount of funds available, or extending theduration of loans to six months, could push down interbanklending rates and indirectly weaken the yen, analysts say. Sceptics at the BOJ argue that the yen's drivers aredifferent now than they were in December. Investors now view theyen more as a safe haven and are not focusing on short-terminterest rate differentials like they were in December.Therefore, lowering money market rates this time might not havethe impact it had in December. "It's an option but it won't work both in terms of affectingcurrency moves and supporting the economy," said a sourcefamiliar with the BOJ's thinking. Still, it is among the favoured options within the BOJ as itis easier to implement than other more aggressive measures. The move would be more of a token gesture to show the centralbank was doing what it could to support the economy. Market reaction: It would have little impact on money marketrates and the yen, as such a move is already widely expected inthe markets. BUY MORE GOVERNMENT BONDS, ASSETS Possibility: Less Likely This is a less attractive option for the BOJ, which worriesthat increasing government bond purchases from current levels of21.6 trillion yen per year could give the impression it wasdirectly financing government spending. But it would surprise markets and please the government,which may not be satisfied with the widely expected move ofexpanding the BOJ's fund supply scheme. Although 10-year bond yields have already dipped below 1.0percent, buying more bonds could be a more effective way tosupport growth as long-term yields still have room to fall. Additional buying could also weaken the yen by showingmarkets its determination to expand fund supply, analysts say. Market reaction: Bond yields might briefly fall, subsequentlypushing down the yen. But there could be a danger of yieldsrising if markets felt Japan was losing control over its debt. STRENGTHEN COMMITMENT TO EASY POLICY Possibility: Unlikely If the government steps up pressure on the BOJ to ease policyfurther it may cave in to lawmakers' calls to set a more rigidinflation target and commit itself to do more to beat deflation. But this is unlikely for now, as Shirakawa is against settinga strict price target for fear of binding future monetary policy,BOJ officials say. The BOJ may instead opt for a vaguer commitment, such aspledging to keep rates low until Japan is comfortably out ofdeflation. The Federal Reserve's stated commitment to keep rateslow for an "extended period" could be an example, analysts say. The challenge would be to make the pledge clear enough to beeffective but vague enough to leave policy options open. Market reaction: Two-year bond yields, most sensitive tomonetary policy, might fall. But the move could be short-lived assuch a commitment is effective when markets are starting tofactor in the chance of a rate hike, which is not the case now. REVERT TO QUANTITATIVE EASING, ZERO RATES Possibility: Highly unlikely The BOJ already floods markets with cash as it did during itsfive-year quantitative easing policy until 2006. It now targetsinterest rates, whereas under its quantitative easing policy ittargeted liquidity. But it is strongly against reverting to a formal quantitativeeasing policy with a liquidity target, as it feels the policy didlittle to boost the economy or beat deflation. Achieving a liquidity target would also be tougher now asbanks are in less need of funds than they were a decade ago, whenJapan was mired in a severe credit crunch, BOJ officials say. Cutting the policy rate to zero from 0.1 percent is alsoamong the least favoured options, as it would discourage banksfrom trading in the money market and make it hard for the BOJ toguide short-term rates. But the BOJ may opt to set a range of zero to 0.1 percent asits new policy target if it feels expanding its fund supply toolcould push down overnight rates well below 0.1 percent. Market reaction: The shift would come as a surprise andsharply push down money market rates, bond yields and the yen. (Editing by Nathan Layne, Chris Gallagher)             ]]></raw>
