<raw><![CDATA[ WASHINGTON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The International MonetaryFund on Monday altered the basket of currencies comprising theIMF Special Drawing Right but did not open it to any newcurrencies. The IMF shifted a little away from the U.S. dollar and theJapanese yen  and gave more more weight to the euro and pound  in determining new currency weights forthe SDR, which has been mentioned as a potential future globalreserve currency. "The value of the SDR will continue to be based on aweighted average of the values of a basket of currenciescomprising the U.S. dollar, euro, pound sterling and Japaneseyen," the IMF said in a statement. There had been speculation that the IMF could expand theSDR basket to include the Chinese yuan , in anacknowledgment of China's rising clout in the global economy. In a review completed this month, the IMF concluded thatthe SDR should be weighted at 41.9 percent U.S. dollar, 37.4percent euro, 11.3 percent British pound and 9.4 percentJapanese yen, the IMF said. In a review five years ago, the agency concluded that theSDR would be weighted at 44 percent U.S. dollar, 34 percenteuro, 11 percent yen and 11 percent pound. The SDR, created by the IMF over 40 years ago to serve asan international reserve asset, usually is reviewed every fiveyears. Its value is based on a basket of "freely usable"currencies. Discontent with a weakening U.S. dollar has sparkedinterest in finding alternatives to supplant the greenback'sdominant role in the global economy, putting a fresh focus onSDRs. China is now the world's second-largest economy, althoughits currency is not convertible on the capital account andtherefore it is barely used outside China.
