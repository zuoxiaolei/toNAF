<raw><![CDATA[   * NZ jobless rate jumps on lost jobs, bigger workforce * Employment falls amid patchy recovery * Data backs views central bank will pause on rate rises * NZ dollar slides, debt rises (Adds comment, market reaction, background) By Mantik Kusjanto WELLINGTON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - New Zealand's jobless raterose more than expected in the second quarter as jobs were lostand more people looked for work in the fragile economy,prompting markets to scale back expectations for more interestrate hikes this year. A rate rise is still expected next month, but analysts nowexpect the central bank to hold off on further increases forthe rest of the year. A Reuters poll taken last week showed forecasters hadexpected a rise in September and one more before year-end.[NZ/POLL] The New Zealand dollar  fell and interest ratefutures rose after data on Thursday showed the economyunexpectedly lost 6,000 jobs and the work force grew in thethree months to June 30, sending the jobless rate up to 6.8percent from 6.0 percent in the first quarter. The figure was well above economists' forecasts for 6.4percent in a Reuters poll. "We still expect the Reserve Bank to hike in September, butbeyond that, a pause is a real possibility," said ANZ-Nationalsenior economist Khoon Goh. Others said the central bank needed to be even morecautious. "Given this and other soft domestic data flow, and also thefact that we're seeing global commodity price weakness now, webelieve the RBNZ should be pausing at its next meeting," saidGoldman Sachs JBWere economist Philip Borkin. Last week, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) raisedits cash rate by 25 basis points to 3 percent but said furtherhikes would probably be more gradual due to a subdued economicoutlook. Markets have been lowering expectations of how far and howfast rates will increase because of the uneven domesticrecovery, which has been dogged by sluggish consumption, astagnant housing market, and slowing migration, along with asoftening global outlook. On Wednesday, dairy giant Fonterra said it would review theforecast payout level for farmers in the coming season becauseof a fall in world prices over past four months. See[ID:nSGE67309D] Fonterra's moves are closely tracked because the companygenerates about 7 percent of the country's economy. The job data showed part-time employment fell 1.6 percent,overshadowing a 0.2 percent rise in full-time jobs growth. RATE PAUSE RISK Markets now see a 64 percent chance of a rate rise at theSept 16 review  compared with a 74 percent chancebefore the jobs data. Traders also scaled back expectations for total rate risesover the next 12 months to 72 basis points (bps) from 87 bpslast week. The kiwi  fell about 1 percent to a low of $0.7276from $0.7350 before the data, while the yield on interest ratefutures <0#NBBM:> rose by up to 14 points as investors paredback rate back rate expectations. The sharp drop in the jobless rate in the first quarter to6.0 percent from a 10-year high of 7.1 percent is now regardedas a statistical anomaly. New Zealand's jobless rate compares with the OECD averageof 8.6 percent and 5.2 percent in Australia. The labour market usually lags the broader economy, andweakness at a time when a recovery is underway and gatheringpace is no surprise. The RBNZ started to bring rates back to a more normal levelin June amid expectations that the economic recovery would spurinflationary pressures. It had cut rates to record low 2.5 percent to support theeconomy through recession and the global financial crisis. Earlier this week, data showed wages grew modestly in theJune quarter, while a survey by the National Bank of NZ lastmonth showed businesses' hiring intentions falling.             ]]></raw>
