Japan's solo foray into currency markets on Wednesday, itsfirst in six years, sparked fears other nations might followsuit to prop up sagging exports and that such competitivedevaluations could prove lethal to the slackening globaleconomic recovery. Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda, who has retained his postin a cabinet reshuffle, told a news conference that even thoughhe was aware of such concerns Tokyo was ready to act again ifconfronted with rapid currency moves. The first opportunity to explain Tokyo's actions may comenext week when Prime Minister Naoto Kan will meet U.S.President Barack Obama in New York on Sept. 23 on the sidelinesof a U.N. General Assembly meeting, Japan's Asahi newspaperreported on Friday. In its biggest one-day operation, Tokyo offloaded up to1.86 trillion yen ($21.67 billion), money market data suggests,after the currency jumped to another 15-year high against thedollar, threatening to derail Japan's tentative economicupturn. Noda said the yen's rapid rise -- which he said wasdeviating from the economy's fundamentals -- was the reasonTokyo intervened in currency markets, and that he had nospecific currency levels in mind when deciding whether tointervene. "I'm aware that there are various opinions. But Japan'sstance is that a prolonged yen rise is undesirable as theeconomy remains in a severe situation with ongoing deflation.It is important to consistently explain our stance to theinternational community," Noda told reporters after a cabinetmeeting. Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of euro zone financeministers and Luxembourg's prime minister, has said thatJapan's unilateral intervention to weaken its currency was notwelcomed and that the euro zone had told Japan of itsdisapproval. With the market wary of pushing the dollar down too faragainst the yen after Tokyo's action, the dollar was steadyaround 85.80 yen on Friday, 3 yen above Wednesday's 15-year lowof 82.87 yen. "It seems that Japan has shifted its argument to focus moreon deflation and less on exporters," said Kimihiko Tomita, headof foreign exchange at State Street Bank & Trust Co in Tokyo. A strong yen weighs on Japanese exporters' profits andmakes it harder for Tokyo to end the long spell of fallingprices that dampens consumer demand and discourages corporateinvestment. The Bank of Japan has refrained from draining the extrafunds released into the banking system via foreign currencypurchases, effectively further easing monetary conditions byboosting the the amount of money circulating in the market. Still, economists expect the impact to be limited giventhat the central bank's benchmark interest rate is already nearzero and corporate demand for loans is weak. The central bank did not conduct a money market operationFriday morning, boosting cash that commercial banks park at thecentral bank by around 2 trillion yen to about 17.1 trillionyen and pushing the overnight call rate slightly below the 0.1percent policy target as a result.
