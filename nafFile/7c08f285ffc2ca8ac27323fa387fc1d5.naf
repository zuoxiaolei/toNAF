<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds comments, changes dateline to add SINGAPORE) HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, Nov 24 (Reuters) - A rapid economicrebound, strong currency gains and higher interest rates inemerging East Asia are drawing in large foreign fund inflowswhich could be potentially destabilising, the Asian DevelopmentBank said in a report. The Manila-based multilateral bank said the risks to themarket outlook are "moderately balanced on the downsidecompared with the first half of the year." ADB which considers emerging East Asia as including China,Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines,Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, made these remarks in itsreport "Asia Bond Monitor", released on Tuesday. The author of the study told reporters in Singapore thatthe economic recovery which was taking hold across the regionwas partially fuelled by government measures through publicexpenditures, loan guarantees and subsidies. "That to some extent is fuelling the economy, fuelling someof the asset market, causing asset inflation -- sustainabilityof this approach can be questioned," said Noritaka Akamatsu,senior advisor, office of regional economic integration. "If you look just at the growth, it is very encouraging,but you have to question the quality of that growth," he saidreferring to the authorities having to consider ways to exitfrom this approach without harming growth prospects. The bank's report also warned that major risks to themarket outlook included uncertainty about the global economicrecovery, a possible rise in inflation, premature tightening ofmonetary policies and potentially destabilising capitalinflows. "These inflows along with ample domestic liquidity, stillaccommodative monetary policies, and limited flexibility ofexchange rates in the region-could pose major challenges formacroeconomic management," it said. Akamatsu said the fast pace of economic growth in Asia andhigher interest rates relative to developed markets wasattracting inflows which was boosting Asian currencies. Someanalysts fear that will make Asian exports much lesscompetitive, impeding further recovery. "The challenge for local authorities is that Asianeconomies are still dependent on exports; the rapid currencyappreciation could damage local export oriented industry," hesaid. In recent weeks, several emerging economies, includingBrazil and Taiwan, have imposed capital controls in an attemptto curb upward pressure on their currencies and prevent stronginflows from creating potentially destabilising asset bubbles.[ID:nSP488359] ADB said in the report that total outstanding debt inemerging East Asia's local currency bond market grew by 14.8percent to $4.2 trillion in the third quarter compared with ayear ago, up from the 13 percent in the second quarter. It said that local currency bonds accounted for 62 percentof gross domestic product at the end of the third quarter,compared with 58 percent at close of the second quarter. "These robust growth rates reflect financing needs forgovernment fiscal stimulus programs, as well as corporatesector funding needs in infrastructure and energy," the reportsaid.
