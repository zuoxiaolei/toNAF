<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro edged lower against the dollar on Wednesday, despite preliminary data showing that the euro zone economy returned to growth in the second quarter, exiting an 18-month recession.EUR/USD hit 1.3249 during European morning trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3250, slipping 0.09%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.3200 and resistance at 1.3316, Tuesday’s high.Eurostat said the euro zone’s economy expanded by 0.3% in the three months to June. Economists had expected quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.2%.The economy contracted 0.7% on a year-over-year basis, compared to expectations for a 0.8% contraction.Earlier Wednesday preliminary data showed that France’s economy expanded 0.5% in the second quarter, following two consecutive quarters of contraction. Economists had forecast growth of 0.2% quarter-on-quarter.A separate report showed that Germany’s economy expanded by 0.7% after growing 0.1% in the first quarter. Economists had forecast quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.6%.Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned after U.S. retail sales data on Tuesday reinforced the view that the economic recovery is strong enough for the Federal Reserve to begin phasing out its USD85 billion-a-month asset purchase program later this year.The euro was also lower against the pound and the yen, with EUR/GBP down 0.19% to 0.8568 and EUR/JPY dipping 0.03% to 130.19.Sterling was boosted after official data showed that the U.K. unemployment rate remained unchanged at 7.8% in June, in line with expectations. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits fell by 29,200 in July, better than expectations for a decline of 15,000.Meanwhile, the minutes of the Bank of England’s July meeting showed that the decision to provide forward guidance on future rate increases was not unanimous.Last week the BoE announced plans to keep interest rates on hold at record lows as long as the U.K. unemployment rate remains above 7%.The BoE set out three conditions under which forward guidance on rates would not apply. One of these says bank will consider raising rates if medium term inflation expectations rise above 2.5% over 18 to 24 months. Monetary Policy Committee member Martin Weale favored a shorter time period but said he accepted the principles of forward guidance.The minutes showed that policymakers voted unanimously in favor of keeping the bank rate steady at 0.5% and the asset purchase program unchanged at GBP375 billion.             ]]></raw>
