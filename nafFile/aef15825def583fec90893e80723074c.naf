<raw><![CDATA[ * KOF indicator 2.18 in Feb * Previous months revised up to show 2 rises in row * KOF institute says reading points to accelerating growth  ZURICH, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The brisk recovery of the Swisseconomy is set to pick up speed again after only a modestslowdown despite the record strength of the Swiss franc, theSwiss leading indicator, the KOF, showed on Friday. The reading ticked up unexpectedly to 2.18 in February froman upwardly revised 2.16 in January, the KOF Swiss EconomicInstitute said. The indicator bottomed in December afterdeclining since July 2010."The moderate downwards movement observed in the second halfof 2010 has been reversed," the KOF said. "This indicates thatin the next months the present pace of growth of the Swisseconomy should gain a bit of momentum." The median forecast in a Reuters poll was for the Februaryreading to slip to 2.08 from January's initial figure of 2.10. The Swiss National Bank expects economic growth to slow toaround 1.5 percent this year from an estimated 2.5 percent in2010 as the strong franc has been taking its toll on theexport-oriented economy. However, SNB policymakers have sounded more sanguine overthe franc's impact recently and SNB Chairman Philipp Hildebrandsaid the economy made a good start this year. The central bank is seen holding interest rates steady atultra-low levels at its quarterly meeting on March 17 becauseinflation is still very low and a rate increase would boost thefranc further.
