<raw><![CDATA[Dollar edges higher on Friday, gains seen limitedInvesting.com - The dollar edged higher against a basket of major currencies on Friday as a global selloff sent equities markets lower, but gains looked likely to be temporary amid expectations that U.S. interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.USD/JPY ended Friday’s session at 101.61, after weakening to 101.31 earlier in the trading day, the lowest since March 19. For the week, the pair lost 1.41%.Demand for the yen continued to be underpinned after the Bank of Japan indicated earlier in the week that it was unlikely to implement further stimulus measures in the short term.The dollar was almost unchanged against the euro at the close of trade, with EUR/USD trading at 1.3884, after touching session highs of 1.3905 earlier. The pair ended the week 1.04% higher, the largest weekly gain since September.The greenback briefly found support after data on Friday showed that U.S. producer prices rose 0.5% in March, the largest increase in nine months and ahead of expectations for a 0.1% increase.However, the dollar remained under pressure after the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s March meeting indicated that an interest rate increase is unlikely to be warranted for some time.The Fed’s March meeting minutes, released on Wednesday, showed that policymakers discussed whether to keep interest rates at record lows until inflation moves higher, and did not elaborate on a possible timeframe for when rates could start to rise.Last month the U.S. central bank reduced the monthly pace of asset purchases by $10 billion, to $55 billion, and repeated it is likely to continue paring the program in “further measured steps.”The dollar gained ground against the pound on Friday, with GBP/USD falling 0.32% to 1.6729 at the close. The drop in sterling came after data showed that U.K. construction output fell in February as heavy rain, which led to flooding in parts of the country, delayed work.The dollar was also higher against the commodity linked Australian and Canadian dollars. AUD/USD slipped 0.18% to 0.9398 on Friday, paring back the week’s gains to 1.42%, while USD/CAD advanced 0.41% to 1.0978.In the week ahead, market watchers will be focusing on speeches by Fed Chair Janet Yellen, as well as reports on U.S. retail sales and housing starts.
