<raw><![CDATA[ * Profit-taking may keep euro under pressure until Friday * Fed Chairman Bernanke's testimony before Congress in focus * Euro bids seen at $1.2860/65 and below By Rika Otsuka TOKYO, July 21 (Reuters) - The euro inched up against thedollar on Wednesday, after being knocked from a 10-week highabove $1.3000 the previous day due to profit-taking ahead of eurozone bank stress test results this week. Traders were also looking to Federal Reserve Chairman BenBernanke's semi-annual testimony before Congress on Wednesday andThursday, with investors listening for any comments that couldboost speculation about more monetary accommodation. "A rise in U.S. share prices late on Tuesday appeared to bedriven by speculation of more easing steps from the Fed. Thus,the lack of a hint on further easing in his testimony could hurtthe dollar," said Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo MitsuiTrust and Banking Corp. The euro moved little in Asian trade, changing hands at$1.2885, up less than 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade. It rose as far as $1.3029 on trading platform EBS on Tuesday,its highest since May 10, but has been unable to hold above$1.3000 after testing it for three days in a row. Traders said players were likely to keep taking profits inthe near term on the euro's sharp rally which has taken it upmore than 8 percent since it hit a 4-year low of $1.1876 in earlyJune. But there was also talk of bids in the euro at $1.2860/65 andthen at $1.2820, with a mixture of stop-loss sell orders and bidsthen expected around $1.2780/2800. On the charts, formerresistance at about $1.2770-90 has now turned into support. Losses in the euro are expected to be limited before thestress test announcements due on Friday, with some analystssaying the results could soothe concerns about how European bankswould cope with a deterioration in the region's economy andfinancial markets. "Players want to trim long euro positions as they have keptbuying euros since early June," said Tsutomu Soma, senior managerof the foreign securities department at Okasan Securities. "But many continue to bet the euro will remain on an upwardtrend, partly due to the dollar's weakness." Against the Japanese currency, the euro dipped 0.3 percent to112.25 yen. The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 87.13 yen, as Japaneseexporters lowered their offers after they saw the currencyhitting a new seven-month trough of 86.27 yen on EBS. But buying from retail Japanese investors and margin tradersis providing the greenback with some support, traders said. A string of weaker-than-expected data in recent weeks hasfanned fears about a slowing U.S. recovery, prompting investorsto cut long positions in the greenback. Data showed on Tuesday that U.S. housing starts fell morethan expected in June to their lowest level in eight months,further evidence that the economy has lost momentum in the secondquarter. Traders said the dollar is under pressure partly becauseexpectations for a U.S. interest hike in 2011 are fading and arebeing replaced by speculation about further easing. The two-year U.S. Treasury note yield hit a record low, andit now yields about 20 basis points less than two-year Germanbonds. Until less than a month ago, U.S. notes yielded more thanGerman debt. Some analysts said the reversal in the bond yieldsspurred buying in the euro. With interest rate differentials playing a key role incurrency markets, Bernanke's comments could set the tone of themarkets in coming weeks, traders said. "Bernanke could hint at further monetary policy easing,although the possibility of actually relaxing the Fed's policy isnearly zero," said Hideki Hayashi, global economist at MizuhoSecurities. "Such a hint is likely to warm up investor appetite, liftingshare prices." But how that could move the dollar's exchange rates is hardto predict, Hayashi said. Last week, the Federal Reserve downgraded its economicoutlook for this year but stuck with its prediction of trend toabove-trend growth in 2011.
