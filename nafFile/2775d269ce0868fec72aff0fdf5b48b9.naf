<raw><![CDATA[ * Drewry consultants see 2011 container ship profits falling * Sees 2011 industry profits at $8 bln vs $17 bln in 2010 * Market share fight could knock profits below forecast * Global container fleet to grow 8.5 percent in 2011  By John Acher COPENHAGEN, Jan 11 (Reuters) - A fight for market sharebetween container shipping lines is denting rates and profits,and a lack of capacity discipline could knock earnings belowcurrent estimates, shipping consultants Drewry said. The global shipping industry rebounded in 2010 from a dismalyear in 2009 when the economic crisis hit trade, cargo volumesand freight rates. But Drewry sees container shippers' collective profitsdropping to around $8 billion this year from an estimated $17billion in 2010, still a rebound from losses of $19.5 billion in2009, it said in a Jan. 11 glimpse of its new ContainerForecaster analysis. "This (2011 profitability) could be considerably lower ifcarriers' pricing and capacity discipline weakens further,"Drewry said in a statement. Maersk Line, owned by Danish shipping and oil group A.P.Moller-Maersk, is the world's biggest container shipper. Major rivals include privately owned Switzerland-basedMediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), French privately heldCMA-CGM, China's COSCO, Korea's Hanjin Shipping, Taiwan'sEvergreen Marine and others. Freight rates have come off peaks seen around August 2010,which will pull earnings back towards more normal levels thisyear from last year's strong results, London-based Drewry said. "2009 was a horrendous year for the industry when a coupleof carriers should have gone under but didn't," Neil Dekker,editor of Drewry's container forecast, told Reuters on Tuesday. "The rebound in 2010 was surprisingly strong -- I don'tthink anyone foresaw the demand rebound in the early part of theyear -- and because of carriers' discipline on the supply side,they got a lot of rate increases through and did extremelywell," Dekker said. But capacity discipline has weakened. Towards the end of2010 carriers did not withdraw capacity from the market whichcould have helped them bolster rates, he said. "If you look at Asia-Europe (trade), the net result is thatmost carriers tried for a general rate increase on January 1,and that has pretty much failed and existing rates have beenextended into January," Dekker said. He said that the forecast 2011 earnings drop was "fairlysignificant," but added: "In the grand scheme of things, wewould project that operating profit margins for carriers wouldbe around 5-6 percent and that is historically about average." Several carriers had revived shipbuilding despite stilltighter financing, Drewry said, and it projected that the globalcontainer fleet would grow by 8.5 percent in 2011. It forecast that average east-west freight rates would fallby 7 percent this year after a strong rebound in 2010. "The fear is what carriers will do on the capacity front,"Dekker said, adding that looming in the background are a numberof ships of 10,000 12,000 and 13,000 TEU (twenty-foot equivalentunits) due to be delivered. "We estimate roughly 50 ships this year," he said. "We thinkthere will be question marks over the supply-demand balance inthe Asia-Europe trade." "But that does not mean the industry is going to fall off acliff, it just won't be as good in a comparative perspective." (Editing by David Cowell)             ]]></raw>
