<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The pound fell to a three-day low against the U.S. dollar on Monday, as market sentiment weakened ahead of a highly anticipated meeting of European Union finance ministers in Luxemburg later in the day, amid ongoing concerns over Greece and Spain.   GBP/USD hit 1.6072 during European morning trade, the pair's lowest since October 3; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.6078, shedding 0.33%.   Cable was likely to find support at 1.5992, the low of September 11 and resistance at 1.6175, the high of October 1.   Markets were jittery ahead of the meeting in Luxemburg and as German Chancelor Angela Merkel was to make her first trip to Greece since July 2007 on Tuesday.   Merkel's visit coincides with deliberations among Greeceâ€™s troika of international creditors - the ECB, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund - on whether the country will receive its next installment of aid.   Sentiment had strengthened on Friday, after data showed that the U.S. unemployment rate unexpectedly dropped to its lowest level in nearly four years.   Elsewhere, the pound was higher against the euro with EUR/GBP falling 0.17%, to hit 0.8065.   Also Monday, data showed that the Sentix index of investor confidence in the euro zone for October ticked up to minus 22 from a reading of minus 23.2 the previous month.   Analysts had expected the index to improve to minus 20.8.   Trading volumes were expected to be light on Monday, as markets in the U.S. were to remain closed for Columbus Day.             ]]></raw>
