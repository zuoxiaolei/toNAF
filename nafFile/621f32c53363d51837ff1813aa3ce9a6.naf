Johnson NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - The dollar firmed slightlybut remained near a one-year low against a basket of currencieson Wednesday as investors braced for a Federal Reservestatement expected to keep U.S. interest rates at record lows. Dealers were on alert, though, for signs that the Fed maycurtail some of the programs that over the last year haveinjected trillions of dollars into the troubled banking system.That kept exchange rate moves somewhat subdued. "People are watching for tweaks to their current programs,which would be market-moving, but I don't think they want torattle the markets right now," said Jacob Oubina, seniorcurrency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. Traders were also keeping an eye on a Group of 20 nationssummit, which begins on Thursday and is expected to call oncountries to maintain economic stimulus plans, a move thatcould boost riskier assets. The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value againsta basket of six other major currencies, was marginally higherat 76.239, off an earlier low of 75.892, a level not seen sincelast September. The dollar has shed 2.5 percent this month, though marketstrategists warned that any hints from the Fed about exitstrategies could squeeze large short-dollar positions. The euro pulled back a bit from a one-year high above $1.48as U.S. stocks turned negative and was down 0.2 percent at$1.4761. Sterling rose 0.3 percent to $1.6407 and the dollarrose 0.3 percent to 91.40 yen.

The New Zealand dollar hit a 13-month high after datashowed the economy exited a recession in the second quarter,sooner than expected. It was last up 0.5 percent at $0.7214.             ]]></raw>
