<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The dollar rallied against the euro on Thursday after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi indicated that the bank could implement negative interest rates for commercial lenders.During U.S. morning trade, the dollar rose to session highs against the euro, with EUR/USD dropping 1.01% to 1.3045.The euro weakened broadly after Draghi said the ECB has an “open mind” on a negative deposit rate for banks. The deposit rate is the rate paid by the ECB on overnight deposits by euro zone banks.The euro hit session highs against the dollar earlier in the session after the ECB cut the benchmark interest rate to 0.5% from 0.75%, amid mounting concerns over the outlook for the region’s economy.Draghi said the interest rate cut should help the euro zone economy to recover “later in the year”.Draghi also said the ECB is closely monitoring money market conditions and will be extending its “main refinancing operations” until at least July 14. The dollar pulled away from two-and-a-half month lows against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.34% to 1.5501. The dollar was boosted after the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance last week fell by a larger-than-forecast 18,000 to 324,000, a five-year low.A separate report showed that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed by 11% to a seasonally adjusted USD38.8 billion in March from a deficit of USD43.6 billion in February, as imports fell sharply.The dollar rose to session highs against the yen, with USD/JPY advancing 0.74% to 98.11.The dollar was also sharply higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF surging 0.87% to 0.9352.The greenback was broadly higher against its Australian, New Zealand and Canadian counterparts, with AUD/USD down 0.27% to 1.0247, NZD/USD falling 0.20% to 0.8481 and USD/CAD dipping 0.02% to 1.0079.In Canada, official data showed that the trade deficit was flat in March, narrowing from a deficit of CAD1.2 billion in February.  Analysts had expected a deficit of CAD0.7 billion.The Australian dollar weakened earlier after official data showed that domestic building approvals fell 5.5% in March, undermining the view that lower interest rates were boosting the housing sector.Elsewhere, the final reading of China’s HSBC manufacturing purchasing managers' index dropped to 50.4 in April from 51.6 in March and slightly lower than the preliminary reading of 50.5, as new export orders fell.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, climbed 0.92% to 81.39.              ]]></raw>
