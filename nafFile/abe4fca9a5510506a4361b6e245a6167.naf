<raw><![CDATA[ * Risk-takers pause ahead of U.S., China data on Friday * Tech shares lift S.Korea, Taiwan stocks * Euro recovers after hitting 1-month low vs dollar By Kevin Plumberg HONG KONG, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Japan led a slide in Asianstock markets on Wednesday as worries about the strength of aglobal recovery prompted investors to trim some bets ahead ofthe year end, while the euro picked up from a one-month low onbargain hunting. Major European stocks were expected to open roughly steady,according to financial bookmakers, after a 1.6 percent declinein the FTSEurofirst 300 index on Tuesday after Greece'ssovereign credit rating was downgraded. Focus among investors was shifting from disappointing U.S.results and debt rating concerns to November U.S. retail salesand a deluge of Chinese economic data due on Friday to gaugehow strong the global recovery really is. Though a large downward revision to Japanese economicgrowth in the third quarter was not expected to herald anotherrecession, it was a sobering reminder of how weak demand anddeflation are hounding Asia's largest economy. "Japan's GDP data came in below expectations, and this doesgive the impression that things aren't looking too good for theeconomy just down the road," Noritsugu Hirakawa, a strategistat Okasan Securities in Tokyo. Japan's Nikkei share average finished 1.3 percent lower,down a second day after a blistering rally in the first week ofDecember lifted the index to its highest in about five weeks. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan slipped0.6 percent, with the materials sector the biggest drag. The Thomson Reuters index of Asia ex-Japan equities wasalso down 0.6 percent. Stock markets in both South Korea and Taiwan bucked adeclining trend and rose 0.4 percent. Exporters in botheconomies have been adding to market share and have seenexports grow on an annual basis in November for the first timein more than a year. The euro traded in a narrow range after a three-day declineagainst the U.S. dollar. It was steady at $1.4703. Greece's rating downgrade gave dealers enough of a reasonto push the euro to a one-month low below $1.4680, but dealersin the Asian session were quick to support it. Since hitting a 15-month low on Nov. 26, the ICE FuturesU.S. dollar index, a measure of its value against six othermajor currencies, has risen 3 percent. The index was steady onthe day at 76.235. Government bonds in the region rose as money flowed fromfalling equity markets and investors chose safety after Moody'scut ratings on six government-run companies in Dubai. "The news increased nervousness surrounding Dubai, with itscredit default swaps widening, but we continue to believe thatany major problems there will be of local or regional natureand will not shake global markets," Dariusz Kowalczyk, chiefinvestment strategist with SJS Markets in Hong Kong, said in anote. Ten-year Japanese government bond futures rose 0.3 point to140.36, withing striking distance of a 20-month high reached onDec. 1. U.S. crude futures rose 73 cents to $73.15 a barrel afterindustry data showed a surprise drawdown in U.S. inventories,after a five-session streak of losses chopped $6 off oilprices.
