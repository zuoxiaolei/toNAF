<raw><![CDATA[ * UK PM says weak economy could damage standing in world * Cameron says fears of British decline are overdone  (Adds quotes, deletes one phrase cut from delivered speech) By Matt Falloon LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Britain's global influence is notin decline but the country must repair its economy quickly toremain a leading actor on the world stage, Prime Minister DavidCameron said on Monday. Britain is recovering from its worst recession since WorldWar Two but Cameron said the rise of new economic powers did notspell the end of British influence and the country remained amajor economic and military power. "There are some who say Britain is embarked on an inevitablepath of decline," Cameron said in a major foreign policy speechin London's financial district. "I want to take that argumenthead on. Britain remains a great economic power." Cameron came to power in May at the head of a coalition thatis determined to slash public spending after a banking crisisand a deep recession sent the budget deficit soaring to 11percent of national output, a peacetime record. The squeeze on public spending will lead to cuts in defenceand public services and could throw half a million governmentemployees out of work. Cameron said foreign leaders respected Britain'sdetermination to "get our economic house in order", which wasessential if the country was to continue to carry weight in theworld. "Economic strength will restore our respect in the world andour national self-confidence," he said. UK economic growth has been stronger than expected this yearbut a slowdown is expected in 2011, largely because of thegovernment's efforts to slash the deficit.  HARD-HEADED APPROACH Cameron pledged to defend London's position as a leadingworld financial centre. A European Union drive for tighterregulation of hedge funds and private equity groups -- many ofwhich are based in London -- following the financial crisis ledto fierce battles between Britain and France. "I can promise you this: We will stand up, at each and everyturn, for our financial services industry and the City ofLondon," he said. He hailed the release of Myanmar pro-democracy leader AungSan Suu Kyi, saying it was a "fantastic sight" to see her free. Cameron has recalibrated British foreign policy to focus onfostering business ties across the world in an effort to boostexports. Britain has 9,500 troops in Afghanistan, the secondbiggest foreign force, but defence cuts mean it will not have anaircraft carrier equipped with fast jets for the next decade. "We ... have to be more strategic and hard-headed about howwe go about advancing our national interests," Cameron said. Britain's relationship with the United States is "crucial"because of close bilateral cooperation on defence,counter-terrorism and intelligence, Cameron said. Britain was a"strong and active" member of the 27-nation EU, he said. But he said there were other areas where British policyneeded to change. "We must link our economy up with thefastest-growing parts of the world, placing our commercialinterest at the heart of our foreign policy," he said. Britain will apply the "more strategic and hard-headed"approach to the mission in Afghanistan and will focus more ofits foreign aid budget on preventing conflict, he said.
