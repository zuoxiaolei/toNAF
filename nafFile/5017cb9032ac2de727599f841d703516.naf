<raw><![CDATA[ * World trade continues on downward trend * Signs of stabilisation, particularly in Asia * Trade contracts 8.4 pct in year to May  GENEVA, July 23 (Reuters) - World trade volumes remain on asharp downward trend, but signs of stabilisation are appearing,particularly in Asia, the Dutch CPB research institute said onThursday. Trade volumes in the 12 months to May were 8.4 percent lowerthan a year earlier, compared with a 6.4 percent decline in the12 months to April, it said in its latest World Trade Monitor. In both April and May, trade volumes were about 20 percentlower than a year earlier. The figures reflect the massive slowdown in exports andimports reported by countries around the globe, as the economiccrisis shrivels demand. On Wednesday, the World Trade Organisation repeated itsforecast that trade would contract 10 percent this year, thebiggest annual contraction since World War Two. The CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis,whose data are used by the European Commission and World Bank,said the falls in April and May contrasted with growth of 9.9percent in the year to November 2006, the peak of the currentcycle. But in the three months to May 31, trade volumes droppedonly 3.6 percent against the previous three months, comparedwith a 6.0 percent fall in the three months to April and a 12.7percent drop in the three months ended February. "No regions showed positive trade momentum yet, but Asia wasclose to stabilisation," it said. On the monthly figures, which are notoriously volatile,trade volumes in May were 1.3 percent lower than in April, whenthey declined 1.0 percent from March.
