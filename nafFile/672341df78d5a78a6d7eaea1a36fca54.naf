<raw><![CDATA[ (Repeating to additional subscribers with no changes to text) * Asian share markets soft on profit-taking, local issues * Tokyo weighed down by plunge in Japan Airlines shares * Nikkei ends year up 19 pct against 42 pct fall in 2008 * Oil holds below $79 a barrel; dollar at 2-month high By Elaine Lies TOKYO, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Asian share markets fell onWednesday as year-end trade dwindled, with profit-takingpulling down shares and bankruptcy worries about Japan Airlines<9205.T> weighing on the Nikkei, while the dollar rose broadly. Shares of JAL tumbled to a record low on growing investorworries that the carrier will be restructured in a bankruptcycourt as part of a state bailout. [ID:nTOE5BT00R] European shares were seen opening down, with Britain's FTSE100  expected to start as much as 0.2 percent lower,financial bookmakers said. "Overall, my impression is that there's probably a bit ofprofit-taking going on ahead of the year-end, particularly withU.S. indicators coming up next week," said Hideyuki Ishiguro, astrategist at Okasan Securities in Tokyo. "Given recent gains, it's not surprising for most marketsto take a bit of a breather today." On the final trading day of the year, Japan's Nikkeiaverage  fell 0.9 percent, but gained 19 percent in 2009after falling 42 percent in 2008, which was the biggest loss inits 58-year history. High-tech exporters led gains while banks lagged, hurt byfears about equity financing as well as JAL's woes. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan fell 0.2 percent, edging further from its 2009high set in November but still up nearly 66 percent on theyear. Corporate debt problems also hit shares in South Korea,where the benchmark index  initially fell, led down bycompanies in the Kumho Asiana Group following reports thatflagship units of South Korea's ninth-biggest business groupcould be put under creditor-led debt restructuring.[ID:nTOE5BS074] and [ID:nTOE5BT01H]. Shares in Kumho Tire <073240.KS> and Kumho Industrial<002990.KS> both plunged by their daily limit of 15 percent butthe benchmark edged up 0.6 percent to cap the year with gainsof 50 percent. "Investors will take a very conservative approach on KumhoAsiana Group companies until some of the uncertainties areresolved," said Yoon Jin-il, an analyst at IBK Securities. Many analysts expect stocks to rise further in 2010 as theglobal economy continues to mend, but gains are likely to be ata much slower pace. Australian stocks rose to their highest in nearly 10 weeksearly in the day but quickly retreated to fall 0.2 percent,snapping a four-day rally, as energy and metals stocks fell instep with commodities prices . U.S. stocks slipped overnight, breaking a six-day string ofgains. Data showing a rise in consumer confidence was offset bya housing report pointing to more bumps in the road to asustained economic recovery. [.N] DOLLAR GAINS The dollar hit a two-month high at 92.26 yen ,keeping the firmer tone it has developed recently on shiftingsentiment about the outlook for U.S. interest rates. It waslater trading at 91.99, up 0.5 percent. The main question for the currency market going into 2010is when the Federal Reserve will start to tighten policy. Improved U.S. data in the past month has prompted manymarket watchers to review their forecasts for when rates mightstart to rise, lifting the dollar up from a 14-year low againstthe yen and reviving its fortunes against other majorcurrencies. "The market is shifting its focus to the recently emergedtheme of whether the Fed exit strategy will be sooner thanexpected. And it will closely scrutinise upcoming U.S. economicdata," said Kazuyuki Takami, senior manager at the foreignexchange trading department at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.4344 . Oil held steady below $80, weighed down by the dollar'sgains and doubts whether predictions for a weekly fall ingovernment-monitored U.S. crude stockpiles will come true,after a private-sector report showed an unexpected rise. U.S.crude for February delivery  stood just above $79 abarrel. Gold  stood at $1,095.75 per ounce, after snapping athree-session winning streak the day before when the dollar'srise curbed its appeal as a currency alternative.Spot gold had tumbled to a seven-week low of $1,074.10 anounce last week before the holiday break.
