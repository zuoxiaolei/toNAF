<raw><![CDATA[ * U.S.-China action seen vital to address climate change * U.S. companies eye clean energy tech sales to China * China resisting hard caps on its emissions By Doug Palmer WASHINGTON, July 12 (Reuters) - U.S. Energy SecretarySteven Chu and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke visit theirancestral homeland this week to press China to join with theUnited States in stepped-up efforts to fight global warming. The two Chinese-American cabinet officials arrive inBeijing on Tuesday for talks with senior Chinese leaders and tohighlight how working together to cut greenhouse gas emissionswould benefit both countries and the entire planet. The trip helps set the stage for a visit by PresidentBarack Obama to China later this year that many environmentalexperts hope will focus on the need for joint U.S.-China actionon the climate front. They believe cooperation, perhaps even a bilateral deal,between the world's largest developed country and the world'slargest developing country is vital if efforts to forge a newglobal climate treaty are to succeed. "The potential (for the United States and China to worktogether on climate issues) is very large and the need is veryserious," said Kenneth Lieberthal, a visiting fellow at theBrookings Institute, a U.S. think tank. "It's not one of thosethings where one side benefits and the other side pays." In recent years, China has surpassed the United States tobecome the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide and otherheat-trapping gases blamed for global warming, although its percapita emissions are still far lower. Chu, a Nobel-winning prize physicist who has devoted yearsto climate change issues, is expected to make the case for U.S.and Chinese action to rein in rising global temperatures in aspeech on Wednesday at Tsinghua University in Beijing. "We face an unprecedented threat to our very way of lifefrom climate change," Chu told U.S. senators last week, warningthe world could experience a climatic shift as profound as thelast ice age but in the opposite direction. Locke, a former governor from the export-oriented state ofWashington, is eager to showcase opportunities for China toreduce carbon dioxide emissions using U.S. solar, wind, waterand other renewable technology. "There's a huge need in China which creates huge marketopportunities for our companies. At the same time, there arebig challenges," a Commerce Department official said. PUSH BEIJING China relies on coal, the most carbon-intensive energy, forover two-thirds of its energy needs and that dependence isexpected to continue for decades to come. The United States has the world's largest coal reserves andrelies on coal for about 22 percent of its energy needs,creating a big incentive for the two countries to collaborateon technologies to capture carbon dioxide emissions and injectthem far underground instead of into the air. China's drive to build new nuclear power plants also hascaught the attention of U.S. companies. As Obama pushes Congress to complete work on a bill toreduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, he is under tremendouspressure to get China to agree at a meeting in Copenhagen thisDecember to a quantitative emissions cap. Without such a commitment, a new climate change treaty isunlikely to pass the Senate, said Stuart Eizenstat, who waslead U.S. negotiator for the December 1997 Kyoto climatetreaty, which was never ratified by the United States. China joined with 16 other major world economies last weekin setting a goal of holding the global temperature rise to nomore than 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. But ithas refused to set a short-term target for cutting emissions. Beijing argues it has only been industrializing for a shorttime and that strict caps now would hamper growth andurbanization efforts in a country where most people live inmuch poorer conditions than in the West. Still, the country's latest five-year plan set a goal ofreducing energy intensity by 20 percent by the end of 2010.China has also set a target of using renewable energies to meet15 percent of total energy demand by 2020. The Obama administration should push Beijing to translatesuch goals into binding international commitments as "a firststep," Eizenstat said. Eventually, China will have to agree toemission caps, but that is unlikely this December whencountries meet in Copenhagen, he said. (Editing by Paul Simao)             ]]></raw>
