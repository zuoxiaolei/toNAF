<raw><![CDATA[(Refiles to clarify headline) * Italy production up better than forecast 1.4 percent * France as expected at 0.4 percent * Germany reported way above forecasts last week  ROME, April 11 (Reuters) - Strong industrial production datafrom the euro zone's top three economies pointed to a healthyrise in output in the region in February and strengtheningeconomic growth in the first quarter. Output in Italy rose a stronger than expected 1.4 percent,data showed on Monday, after a steep drop the month before,while France's 0.4 percent gain matched forecasts. "It's pretty much in line with what we were expecting andpoints to a strong first quarter, something we're seeing inother countries like Germany for instance," said Marie Diron ofOxford Economics after the French data. Last week Germany, the economic powerhouse of the 17 nationeuro zone, reported a 1.6 percent output rise for February, wayabove expectations of 0.5 percent and following a 2.0 percentgain in January. The data from the three countries that make up around twothirds of the euro zone economy suggest Wednesday's aggregatereading for the bloc could be stronger than expected. A Reuters survey of analyst conducted last week pointed to a0.7 percent monthly rise, after a 0.3 percent increase inJanuary. Luigi Speranza of BNP Paribas said Italy, the euro zone'sthird largest economy was still lagging most of its neighboursdespite the rebound in output in February. "With a 0.5 percent monthly rise in March we will be lookingat a flat quarter in terms of industrial output, which is quitedisappointing considering the global context of expandingactivity," he said. He forecast euro zone economic growth would strengthen to0.6 percent in the first quarter after the 0.3 percent rate atthe end of last year. Germany will lead the way with growth of 1.0 percent, andItaly will grow by just 0.2 or 0.3 percent, he forecast. (Editing by John Stonestreet)             ]]></raw>
