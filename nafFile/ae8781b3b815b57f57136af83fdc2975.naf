<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - The euro erased gains against the U.S. dollar on Friday, as comments by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi continued to weigh on demand for the single currency, despite news of a European budget ceiling deal.  EUR/USD pulled away from 1.3430, the session high, to hit 1.3379 during European afternoon trade, slipping 0.14%.  The pair was likely to find support at 1.3287, the low of January 25 and resistance at 1.3479, the high of January 25.  The euro remained under pressure after ECB President Draghi said on Thursday that economic weakness in the euro area would persist during the early part of 2013 but said the economy should start to recover “later” in the year.  He added that the recent appreciation in the single currency reflected growing signs of a return of investor confidence in the euro zone.  Meanwhile, European Union leaders agreed on the first-ever cuts in the bloc’s budget.  The agreement should set a 2014-2020 spending ceiling of EUR960 billion, down from an original proposal of EUR1.047 trillion and less than the EUR994 billion spent in the current budget cycle.  In the U.S., official data showed that the trade deficit narrowed more-than-expected in December, moving to USD38.5 billion from a deficit of USD48.6 billion.  Analysts had expected the trade deficit to narrow to USD46 billion in December.  Elsewhere, the euro was lower against the pound with EUR/GBP dropping 0.74%, to hit 0.8464.  Also Friday, a report showed that China's trade surplus narrowed less-than-expected in January, falling to USD29.20 billion from a surplus of USD31.60 billion, compared to expectations for a fall to USD22 billion.  The data added to hopes that the world's second largest economy is on the road to recovery.             ]]></raw>
