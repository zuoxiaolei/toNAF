<raw><![CDATA[ * Main Europe index 1.75 bps tighter, Crossover by 8.5 bps * UBS nearly 5 bps tighter * Portugal Telecom, Energias de Portugal major gainers * ING sees peripherals, financials and CDS outperforming  LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - European credit derivativestightened on Monday following the European Union's approval of a30 billion euro ($40 billion) rescue package for Greece, whichremoved fears of any default in the next few years. Five-year credit default swaps on UBS tightened by 4.7 basispoints to around 83 basis points, according to Markit data,after the Swiss bank reported its highest quarterly pretaxprofit since the start of the credit crisis and said investorwithdrawals had slowed. Barclays Capital cited several key positives of the EUrescue package: the amount was more than expected, the EU willprovide further support over the next two years, the support canbe auctioned rapidly and the cost will be below current marketrates for Greek debt. By 1008 GMT, the investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index was at 77 basis points, according to data from Markit. That is1.75 basis points tighter versus late on Friday, according todata from BGC Partners. The Markit iTraxx Crossover index, made up of 50 mostly"junk"-rated credits, was at 409.5 basis points, 8.50 basispoints tighter. ING credit strategists made a series of recommendations forcredit investors for the coming weeks based on easing concernsabout credits in peripheral European markets. The spread gap between peripherals and non-peripheralcredits in the Europe index is likely to narrow from around 37basis points now to 20 basis points or tighter, they said. Among the biggest movers in peripheral credits on Monday,five-year credit default swaps on Portugal Telecom tightened bymore than 8 basis points to around 126 bps, according to Markitdata. Five-year CDS on Energias de Portugal tightened by nearly 10bps to 126.5 bps.  FINANCIALS TO OUTPERFORM Financial credits are likely to outperform non-financialcorporates, with the spread of the senior financial indexreaching as much as 10 basis points tighter than the Europeindex by the end of the year from 11.5 bps wider at Monday'sopen, ING said. Credit default swaps are likely to outperform cash bonds inthe near term as CDS recover, ING said, although adding itremained more bullish on cash bonds in the medium term. Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service warned that Europeancorporate credits would remain vulnerable to volatility, lowergrowth and tightening fiscal and monetary policies throughout2010 due to weak sovereign credit, including the 146government-related issuers that it rates across Europe. "Slow GDP growth and depressed consumer confidence, cuts ingovernment spending, tax hikes, an increase in the cost offunding and more volatility are all sovereign-related hurdlesthat corporate debt issuers have to navigate," Moody's said.
