<raw><![CDATA[  (Refiles to delete extraneous word in headline) BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - China's Foreign Ministry said onThursday a U.S. House of Representatives bill that would penaliseChina for not letting the yuan rise faster could "seriouslyaffect" bilateral relations and economic ties. Spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a regular news briefing that Chinaurged Congress to avoid steps that could harm relations, addingthat Beijing was "resolutely opposed" to the bill. The bill would need to be passed by the Senate and signed byPresident Barack Obama for it to become law.
