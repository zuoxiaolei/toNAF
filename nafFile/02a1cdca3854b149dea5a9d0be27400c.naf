<raw><![CDATA[ * Three-party coalition has strong majority in lower house * 2011 budget next important task * S&P raises country's outlook to positive on fiscal plans  (Updates with vote delay, analyst, S&P) By Jason Hovet and Robert Mueller PRAGUE, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The new centre-right Czechgovernment looks certain to win a confidence vote in the lowerhouse, clearing an early hurdle as it seeks to push tough budgetcuts and reforms through parliament. Lawmakers opened debate on the three-party coalition onTuesday, but a vote that had been expected in the evening wasnow not likely to come before Wednesday. The government aims to deliver on an election promise toslash spending and improve a fiscal position analysts say isalready among the best in central Europe.  That has made Czech government bonds and the crown safehavens in a volatile region. Standard & Poor's ratings agency raised its outlook for theEuropean Union member to positive on Tuesday, reflecting what itsaid was the likelihood of an upgrade in the next two years ifthe new government implemented its fiscal plans. But the coalition must balance a 10 percent cut to thepublic wage bill and lower welfare benefits with an unemploymentrate of 8.7 percent and worries that belt tightening may stiflean export-led recovery that has largely bypassed consumers. The right-of-centre Civic Democrats, the conservative TOP09and centrist Public Affairs have the largest majority of anygovernment since the creation of the Czech Republic in 1993after winning 118 seats in the 200-member lower house in May. While the coalition has run into a minor dispute over whichministries will face the largest budget cuts, analysts say PrimeMinister Petr Necas' government will easily win the vote, aconstitutional requirement to stay in power.  Charles University political analyst Petr Just said asituation where coalition partners were so close on issues whileholding a strong majority was exceptional in Czech politics, butadded coalition cracks would remain a reality. "These cracks will always appear," Just said. "(But) none ofthe three parties want the government to be crowded out by the(opposition) Social Democrats or the need for early elections."  BELT TIGHTENING Clawing its way out of a 4.0 percent economic contractionlast year, the government expects 2010 growth of 1.6 percent. The next major task will be drawing up a 2011 budget, inwhich the coalition aims to cut the fiscal deficit to 4.6percent of gross domestic product from 5.3 percent this year. The government aims to hit the EU's 3 percent fiscal deficitceiling by 2013, while keeping in check an overall public debtburden of around 38 percent of GDP -- about half the EU average. Standard & Poor's said the country's political commitment tofiscal measures, including plans to tackle financing of apension system whose debt is set to grow with an ageingpopulation, was "significantly higher than in the past". "The positive outlook reflects the likelihood of an upgradeif the government legislates social security reform that lessensageing-related expenditure pressures," S&P said. Prague's cost cutting contrasts with other countries incentral Europe. In Poland, tough reforms are likely to be putoff until after an election next year while the new Hungariangovernment, defying the IMF and the EU, is looking to softennext year's budget goal. The government's commitment to austerity has been partlybehind the crown's rise to 21-month peaks against the euro thismonth, while the benchmark 9-year bond yield has dropped to alifetime low.
