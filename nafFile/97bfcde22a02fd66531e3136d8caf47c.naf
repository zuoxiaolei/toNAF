<raw><![CDATA[ BERLIN, April 25 (Reuters) - Greece must agree to tough newausterity measures before it receives any financial aid from theEuropean Union and failure to do so would endanger such support,German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told a newspaper. "The fact that neither the EU nor the German government havetaken a decision (on providing aid) means that the response canbe positive as well as negative," Schaeuble told the Sundayedition of Bild. "This depends entirely on whether Greece continues in thecoming years with the strict savings course it has launched. Ihave made this clear to the Greek finance minister." Schaeuble said a "tough restructuring programme" for thenext years was "unavoidable and an absolute prerequisite" ifGermany and the EU were to approve the aid Greece has requested.
