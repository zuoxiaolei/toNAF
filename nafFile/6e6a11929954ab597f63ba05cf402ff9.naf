<raw><![CDATA[ * Moody's cuts Greek rating to A2 from A1, outlook negative * S&P, Fitch downgraded Greece to BBB+ earlier this month  (Adds quotes, details) By Ingrid Melander and George Georgiopoulos ATHENS, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Moody's cut Greece's debt to A2from A1 on Tuesday over soaring deficits, becoming the thirdmajor rating agency to downgrade the highly-indebted country'srating this month. Moody's kept Greece on a negative outlook. Its rating isstill two notches above that of Fitch and S&P, which earlierthis month cut their rating on the indebted country to BBB+, theeuro area's lowest level. The one-notch downgrade was less than many investors hadexpected. The spread between 10-year Greek and German benchmarkBunds tightened over the news, and Greek shares opened slightlyhigher, although the euro trimmed gains. "Greece's repositioned rating of A2 balances the Greekgovernment's very limited short-term liquidity risks on the onehand, and its medium- to long-term solvency risks on the other,"said Sarah Carlson, Moody's lead sovereign analyst for Greece. "Moody's notes that the country's longer-term risks haveonly partly been offset by the government's announced policyresponse," Moody's Investors Service said in a statement. The euro trimmed gains against the dollar in response,dipping to around $1.4302 from around $1.4323  before theannouncement. It was last at $1.4309, up 0.2 percent on the day. Moody's A2 rating does not threaten Greece's access toEuropean Central Bank funds at the end of next year when the ECBplans to tighten its collateral rules. But should Moody's downgrade Greece by a further two notchesinto 'B' territory, as Fitch and S&P have already done, come theend of next year, banks would no longer be able to exchangeGreek government debt for cash in ECB refinancing operations. "Moody's believes that Greece is extremely unlikely to faceshort-term liquidity/refinancing problems unless the EuropeanCentral Bank decides to take the unusual step of making thesovereign debt of a member state ineligible as collateral forbank repurchase operations -- a risk that we consider veryremote," says Arnaud Mares, Senior Vice President in Moody'sSovereign Risk Group."Moody's also does not believe that the Greek government'sdifficulties represent a vital test for the future of the eurozone, but rather a repricing of relative risks that had beenconcealed by years of abundant global liquidity and somewhatabove-potential growth," the statement said. The Athens bourse's benchmark stock index , which hasshed 11.9 percent in the last 30 days, was 2.42 percent higherin early trading. "It was a relatively positive surprise, given the rumourscirculating in the market for a 2-notch downgrade. Markets maybounce on the news," said economist Platon Monokroussos at EFGEurobank. Greece is set to become the euro zone's most indebted nationin terms of GDP next year, with public debt seen at 121 percentof GDP. The budget deficit widened to 12.7 percent of GDP in2009. The government plans to cut it to 8.7 percent next year. (Writing by Ingrid Melander, editing by Stephen Nisbet)             ]]></raw>
