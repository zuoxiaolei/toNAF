<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The pound pared losses against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, after U.S. data showed that private sector employment growth slowed sharply and manufacturing activity slumped to a one-year low in May.GBP/USD pulled back from 1.6377, the pair’s lowest since May 26, to hit 1.6423 during early U.S. trade, still down 0.13% on the day.Cable was likely to find support at 1.6266, the low of May 26 and resistance at 1.6546, Tuesday’s high and a four-week high.Earlier in the day, payroll processing firm ADP said U.S. non-farm payrolls rose just 38K in May, on a seasonally adjusted basis, far below expectations for an increase of 178K.The report said the slowdown, while disappointing, was not entirely surprising given weak growth in the U.S. economy so far this year. Real gross domestic product grew only 1.8% in the first quarter.A separate report showed that U.S. manufacturing growth slowed more-than-expected in May, declining to its slowest pace since September 2009.The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity fell to 53.5 in May from 60.4 the month before. The reading disappointed expectations for 57.7.A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, while a number above 50 means expansion.The pound was also lower against the euro, with EUR/GBP rising 0.48% to hit 0.8793.Also Wednesday, official data showed that manufacturing activity in the U.K. grew at its slowest pace in 20 months in May.Separately, the Bank of England said that U.K. mortgage approvals unexpectedly fell to their lowest level since December last month.The data reinforced expectations that the BoE is unlikely to raise interest rates for some time to come.             ]]></raw>
