<raw><![CDATA[* MSCI world equity index up 0.1 percent at 343.35 * Europe, Asia hold below recent highs * Oil, dollar fall  (Adds quotes, updates prices) By Natsuko Waki LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - European stocks and oil pricesturned lower on Tuesday after China raised interest rates forthe second time in just over a month, intensifying its fightagainst inflation. The commodity-sensitive Australian dollar also fell butworld stocks still held near the previous day's 29-month high asChina's monetary tightening did little to immediately change thefavourable outlook for global growth this year. Recent strong manufacturing and services sector surveysaround the world and a fall in the U.S. unemployment rate pointto sustained momentum in the global recovery, while China'slatest move is seen as proactively tackling inflation problems. "Global markets may begin to see the frequent rate hikes asa sign that growth slowdown in China is inevitable, which couldbriefly weigh on market sentiment," said Dariusz Kowalczyk,senior economist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong. "But in the end the move will be seen as a sign of strength,with solid growth momentum allowing policymakers to raise rates-- and... global markets should respond positively to such movesaimed at controlling inflation." The MSCI world equity index  was up 0.15percent, having hit its highest level since August 2008 onMonday. The Thomson Reuters global stock index  wasstill up around 0.1 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  fell half a percent, turning negative after China's move and moving away from theprevious day's 29-month high. U.S. crude oil was the biggest loser after China's move. It fell 1.5 percent to $86.18 a barrel as expectations rosethat the higher cost of borrowing may tame oil demand growth inChina, which is the largest energy consumer in the worldaccording to the International Energy Agency. U.S. stock futures  were slightly higher on the day. Benchmark U.S. equity indexes hit 2-1/2 year highs onMonday, with news of multi-billion-dollar mergers reinforcingexpectations that cash-rich companies are confident enough aboutthe economy to buy up undervalued rivals. [ID:nN07195753][ID:nN07200008] Emerging stocks  were down 0.2 percent on the day.China is closed for the Lunar New Year holidays.  From Feb 9, China's benchmark one-year deposit rates will belifted by 25 basis points to 3 percent, while one-year lendingrates will also be raised by 25 basis points to 6.06 percent.German government bond futures  were steady on the day.  RATE MOVES EYED The Australian dollar  fell around half a U.S. centto $1.0130, tracking commodity prices lower after China's move. In the broader currency market however, the focus was onU.S. and euro zone monetary policies. The euro recovered onTuesday, having been under pressure after last week's commentsfrom European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet cooledexpectations on the pace of monetary tightening. The euro  rose 0.6 percent to $1.3662  while thedollar  fell 0.3 percent against a basket of majorcurrencies. "Our risk-adjusted yield differential indicator has given afresh euro/dollar sell signal over the past couple of days andwe look to use any initial corrective rebound today to establishbearish strategies," BNP Paribas said in a note to clients. Last week's unexpected fall in the U.S. jobless rate alsosparked a rise in U.S. debt yields. The 10-year U.S. yield broke above a trading range that had been in placesince early December and U.S. money markets have started toprice in some chance of a U.S. rate hike later this year. Still, investors are reluctant to buy the dollaraggressively after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke saidlast week that the U.S. economy still needs the Fed's help -- astance many traders expect him to repeat when he speaks onWednesday.
