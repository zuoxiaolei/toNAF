<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The Australian dollar fell to a six-week low against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, as concerns over the worsening debt crisis in the euro zone dampened demand for higher yielding assets.AUD/USD hit 1.0441 during late Asian trade, the pair’s lowest since April 13; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.0468, dropping 0.84%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.0388, the low of April 12 and resistance at 1.0582, Tuesday’s high.The Aussie also came under pressure after a government report showed that construction work completed rose less-than-expected in the first quarter.The statistics bureau said completed construction work increased 0.7% in the three months ended March 31, less than the expected 1.4% gain.Elsewhere, a report showed that Australia’s leading index, a gauge of future economic growth, rose 0.5% in March from a month earlier to 284.5.The Aussie was also sharply lower against the yen, with AUD/JPY tumbling 0.87% to hit 85.76. Later in the day, the U.S. was to publish official data on durable goods orders as well as a government report on crude oil stockpiles.             ]]></raw>
