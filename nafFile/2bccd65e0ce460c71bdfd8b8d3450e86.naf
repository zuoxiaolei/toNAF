<raw><![CDATA[ BERLIN, March 17 (Reuters) - Germany wants to help itsdownturn-hit shipping industry by bringing forward publicorders, the government's maritime expert told Reuters onWednesday. "We are checking whether we can bring forward orders,"Hans-Joachim Otto said. "That could help some firms." The shipping industry in Europe's biggest shipbuildingnation has been hard hit by the global economic crisis. The government wants, therefore, to waive the repayment ofalready allocated state aid for innovation in ship building,Otto said. "These will be changed into subsidies." The plan requires approval by the European Union. Otto said, however, that the shipping industry could notexpect more subsidies from the government at the meetingplanned for Thursday in the Economy Ministry. "We don't have the biggest pot of money," he said. "What weare trying to do is to check the existing tools to make themmore flexible."
