<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com - European stock markets were up in afternoon trade on Monday, as euro zone finance ministers were set to meet in Brussels to discuss how to combat Greece's debt woes.  France’s CAC 40 was up 0.64%; Germany's DAX rose 0.57%; Britain's FTSE 100 was up 0.49%; and the EURO STOXX 50 rose 0.66%.  Shares in British Airways performed particularly well, rising 3.2% after U.S. regulators gave provisional approval for a proposed tie-up with American Airlines. Shares in Iberia, BA's merger partner, jumped 3.6%.  Trade was thin, however, with Wall Street and most Asian markets shut for respective public holidays.  Meanwhile, Spain's finance minister said on Monday that during talks on the following day, euro zone ministers would consider additional measures Greece could take to reduce its gaping budget deficit.  "This is something that has to be discussed tomorrow," Reuters quoted Elena Salgado as telling reporters in Brussels in response to a question on whether the ministers would ask Greece to take additional steps.             ]]></raw>
