<raw><![CDATA[ (Refiling to fix typo in second paragraph) * China Q2 growth quickens, 8 percent 2009 goal in sight * Japan manufacturer mood rises - Reuters Tankan * Asia stocks gain for third session on data, earningshopes * U.S. industrial output appears on the mend (For more on the global crisis, click) By Simon Rabinovitch and Zhou Xin BEIJING, July 16 (Reuters) - China's growth rate shot up inthe second quarter on the back of a surge in state spending andbank lending, boosting hopes the biggest emerging economy willlead the way out of the worst global downturn since the 1930s. A slew of accompanying data for June depicted an economysuccessfully making up for a slump in exports through domesticdemand, but in a note of caution the National Bureau ofStatistics warned the base for recovery remained weak. In Japan, a Reuters poll showed manufacturers' confidencehas improved for four months in a row as exports and industrialoutput picked up, but the mood among services firms has slippedback to near a record low. Encouraging data from the UnitedStates and Europe and upbeat earnings from Goldman Sachs andIntel in recent days has revived optimism that the recession isabating, driving up Asian stocks for a third day on Thursday. "In addition to hopes for a recovery in U.S. corporateearnings, investors are welcoming growing signs of a recoveryin U.S. economic data," said Hiroaki Kuramochi, chief equitymarketing officer at Tokai Tokyo Securities. Japan's Nikkei rose 2.2 percent, while MSCI's index ofshares elsewhere in Asia Pacific rose 1.8 percent to itshighest since mid-June. CHINA TARGET China's annual gross domestic product growth accelerated inthe second quarter to 7.9 percent, up from 6.1 percent in thefirst quarter, making it the best-performing big economy.Economists had forecast 7.5 percent. There was also growth in investment in fixed assets inurban areas in the first half and in June industrialproduction. Retail sales, a rough proxy for consumption, rose15.0 percent in June from a year earlier after May's 15.2percent increase. Although the statistics office said that growth momentumwas "unstable" and the pattern of recovery "unbalanced",economists said the overall performance put China on track toachieve its 8 percent growth target for the year -- the minimumthe Communist Party deems necessary to hold down unemployment. "It's very encouraging, the 8 percent growth target is insight," said Daniel Soh, an economist at Forecast in Singapore."It's by now clear that the fiscal stimulus package has offsetthe contraction in export activity." Japan's rebound in exports and output has fuelled hopes theworld's second-biggest economy may be recovering from its worstrecession since World War Two, but the Reuters Tankan surveyunderscored the threat posed by anaemic domestic demand. That could mean the Bank of Japan may have to extend againmeasures aimed at easing corporate credit strains, after justhaving decided on an extension until the end of the year whenit ended a two-day policy review on Wednesday. "Business sentiment and financial conditions are improvingbut from very low levels," said Tatsushi Shikano, economist atMitsubishi UFJ Securities. "I'm pretty sure the BOJ will haveto extend the measures again when they expire in December." Sentiment among large manufacturers has improved sharplysince hitting a record low in March, lifted by autos andelectronics -- key export industries, the Reuters Tankanshowed. But confidence at non-manufacturers has slipped backnear a record low hit in May. Manufacturers and service-sector firms expect the situationto improve over the next three months, the poll showed. POSITIVE SIGNS Data from the United States, where the global financialcrisis began when a housing boom soured two years ago, and froma Europe also mired in recession has been mixed in recentweeks, stirring uncertainty in markets on the strength of thenascent recovery. But on Wednesday there were positive signs from both sidesof the Atlantic.  U.S. industrial output declined at a slower pace in Juneand New York state's factory survey posted its strongestreading since April 2008. And European car sales showed the first monthly increase inover a year, helped by incentives for junking old cars in somemajor economies, though analysts cautioned that was also due todisastrous numbers a year earlier. A steep drop in fuel costs drove down euro-zone consumerprices for the first time year-on-year in June, which shouldlet interest rates remain low and give consumers some morebuying power.
