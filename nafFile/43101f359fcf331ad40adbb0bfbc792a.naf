<raw><![CDATA[ * EU vows to ensure "adequate" rescue funds if needed * Merkel and Juncker say have patched up differences * Strauss-Kahn says "piecemeal approach" does not work  (Adds pledge of adequate rescue fund, Strauss-Kahn on Spain) By Ilona Wissenbach and Jan Strupczewski BRUSSELS, Dec 16 (Reuters) - European Union leaders agreedon Thursday to create a permanent financial safety net from 2013and the European Central Bank moved to increase its firepower tofight the debt crisis that has rocked the euro zone. But at Germany's insistence, the 27 leaders said thelong-term crisis-resolution mechanism, to be added to the EU'sgoverning treaty, could only be activated "if indispensable tosafeguard the stability of the euro as a whole". They also decided there was no need to increase an existingtemporary rescue fund, which some analysts say could beinsufficient if Spain and Portugal need EU/IMF bailouts afterGreece and Ireland, nor did they discuss using it more flexibly. "The heads of state and government of the euro zone standready to do whatever is necessary to ensure the stability of theeuro zone as a whole," European Council President Herman VanRompuy told a news conference after chairing the first day of atwo-day EU summit. The ECB, in charge of monetary policy in the 16-nation euroarea, said it would almost double its capital to 10.76 billioneuros to cope with bigger credit risk and market volatility.Euro zone members will provide the increase. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told reporters the centralbank's governing council thought it was appropriate to make"additional provisioning" -- a veiled reference to potentiallosses on euro zone sovereign bonds it has bought. IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has beencritical of EU leaders' disjointed response to the rollingcrisis, said he was concerned about slow growth and the threatof contagion in Europe. "I'm worried and that's why I'm urging the Europeans toprovide for a comprehensive solution, because this piecemealapproach obviously doesn't work," Strauss-Kahn told a ThomsonReuters Newsmaker event in Washington. "And the markets are justwaiting for what's next."  RECORD SEVENTH SUMMIT The leaders -- holding a record seventh summit this year --approved a two-sentence amendment to the EU treaty at Germany'sbehest to permit the creation of a European Stability Mechanismto handle financial crises from 2013, Van Rompuy said. The ESM, to replace a temporary European Financial StabilityFacility created in May, will be empowered to grant loans onstrict conditions to member states in distress, with privatesector bondholders sharing the cost of any sovereign debtwritedown on a case-by-case basis. The aim is for all 27 member states to ratify the change byend 2012. Van Rompuy said no country would need to put it to areferendum, removing one potential risk. Decisions will be takenby unanimity, ensuring that EU paymaster Germany retains a veto. The EU, together with the IMF, has set up a 750 billion euro($1 trillion) emergency loan pool to help highly indebted eurozone states unable to finance themselves in volatile markets. The decision by the Frankfurt-based ECB to raise itssubscribed capital base was the first such increase in its12-year lifetime, a mark of the severity of the situation. The central bank has bought some 72 billion euros in eurozone government bonds since May but has resisted politicalpressure to step up these asset purchases substantially to helpindebted governments avoid having to seek a bailout.  Strauss-Kahn said he was concerned about the length of theprocess Europe was going through to resolve its crisis and saidthe EU needed to find a "comprehensive" solution. But he voiced optimism that Spain would be able to ward offthe worst of the debt crisis without needing a rescue, and saidhe saw no threat to the euro's existence.  MERKEL GETS HER WAY German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who pressed for the treatychange to assuage Germany's constitutional court, got her way bykeeping other ideas, such as increasing the size of the EFSF orissuing euro zone bonds, off the summit agenda. She said earlier she had settled a public spat withJean-Claude Juncker, who chairs the finance ministers of theeuro zone, over his call to issue common euro area bonds. The head of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, toldleaders at the summit that euro bonds should not be dismissed.Strauss-Kahn said they could be a useful tool if Europe becamemore centralised, but could not be a starting point now. Merkel contends so-called E-bonds would remove the incentivefor countries to balance their budgets, and raise Berlin's ownborrowing costs. Juncker, who called Germany's instant rejection"un-European", confirmed he had buried the hatchet with Merkelbut stuck to his guns on the euro bond proposal. Spain's Treasury paid a high premium to sell long-term bondson Thursday but found strong demand, in a test of investors'appetite for euro zone peripheral debt. Portugal announced extra measures on Wednesday to cut redtape and bolster structurally slow growth, in a move to convinceEU officials and financial markets it is doing enough to staveoff the pressure to seek EU financial aid. Throughout 2010, EU leaders have struggled to show unity andclear communication in handling the crisis, alternating betweenrushing out half-formed or contradictory proposals and ditheringon the right course of action while markets burned. There has been a relative lull in financial market pressurein the past two weeks as investors and traders close their booksahead of the end of the year, but analysts expect pressure toresume in 2011 without action. Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders said the EU'sportion of the existing crisis fund, totalling 440 billioneuros, could be doubled to fend off the threat of renewed marketpressure on Portugal and Spain. "Of course we need to show wehave deep pockets," Reynders told reporters.             ]]></raw>
