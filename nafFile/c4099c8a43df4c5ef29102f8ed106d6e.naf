<raw><![CDATA[ MOSCOW, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Russia and other countries arelikely to continue gradual diversification of reserves, but asharp move away from the dollar is unlikely in the medium term,Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin was quoted as saying. "Now, after the end of the 'fight to quality' period, thequestion about changing reserve structure arises again," Kudrinsaid in an interview with Russian Manufacturer magazine. Russia has already reduced the dollar's share in itsreserves, the world's third-largest, to less than 50 percent,and has called for less global dependence on the U.S. currency. Along with China, it has called for discussion on thepossibility of creating a new supra-national reserve unit, basedon the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights. But Kudrin said any such process would take years. "In the short and medium term we can hardly expect sharpchanges in the structure of currency reserves, because a sale ofdollar assets would lead to a significant fall in their value.This is also true for Russian reserves," he said. "Most likely there will be continued gradual diversificationof reserves." Russia's central bank has signalled that it is ready to addother currencies to its $400 billion reserves, such as theAustralian  or Canadian  dollars, but is constrainedby lower liquidity in those units. [ID:nLT556258] Emerging market currencies could also join the ranks ofreserve units over time, Kudrin said. "The Chinese yuan is now not a convertible currency. But in10 years it could become convertible and reserve," he said. "The Russian rouble, if it has not yet fully become aregional reserve currency, has the signs of being such." In recent weeks, the rouble has rallied strongly on firm oilprices and brighter economic prospects, prompting the centralbank to regularly intervene in the market as part of a policy tostem excessive currency moves in either direction. Kudrin and other officials have shrugged off suggestionsthat the recent rally poses a concern. "The situation on the global energy market has a significantimpact on the national currency. Now the external backdrop ...is positive for the country," he said. "A weak currency increases risks of inflation, lowers theappeal of investments, leads to the preservation of the currentineffective structure of manufacturing," he said.
