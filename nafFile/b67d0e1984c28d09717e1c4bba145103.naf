<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The pound was up for the second consecutive day against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, rising to a 1-week high in low volume year-end trade, as U.S. Treasury yields retreated, dampening demand for the greenback.    GBP/USD hit 1.5535 during late Asian trade, the pair’s highest since December 21; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.5521, jumping 0.13%.The pair was likely to find support at 1.5349, Wednesday’s low, and resistance at 1.5567, the high of December 21.On Wednesday, U.S. Treasuries advanced, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year note down after the U.S. government’s USD 29 billion auction of seven-year notes produced the highest demand since June 2009.The 10-year note yield dropped as much as 16 basis points to 3.32%, the biggest drop since June 4. Meanwhile, industry research group LSL Property Services said in a report that it expected U.K. home prices to decline by 2.5% in 2011, extending a drop in home prices that began in the third quarter of 2010, as mortgage restrictions and government spending were likely to discourage buyers.Commenting on the report, managing director at LSL David Newnes said, “Buyers remain tentative about the impact of government spending cuts and the prospect of unemployment in 2011. There are simply too many properties coming onto the market that are struggling to find buyers.”   Meanwhile, the pound was also up against the euro, with EUR/GBP falling 0.10% to hit 0.8523.Later in the day, the U.S. was to publish key weekly data on initial jobless claims, as well as official data on pending home sales and a report on manufacturing activity in the Chicago-area.             ]]></raw>
