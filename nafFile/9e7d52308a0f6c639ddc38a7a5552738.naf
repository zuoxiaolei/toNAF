European shares were mostly flat after opening lower. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies, trimminggains it made after the surprise rate hike by China spurred themarket to lower risk exposure, while commodity prices steadiedafter falling sharply on Tuesday. "China's tightening came as a shock, but the country'sintention doesn't seem to be a cooling of its economy, Insteadit has moved to prevent bubbles from bursting. It's rathernatural, if you look at it in the longer term," said TomomiYamashita, senior fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management inTokyo. "Financial markets are still supported by expectations offurther easing by the United States, with ample liquidityhelping assets such as bonds and commodities. The focus fromnow on is whether these money flows will change course." The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan wasdown 0.1 percent at 0725 GMT, after trimming some of its lossessuffered earlier in the day. Japan's Nikkei average pared earlier losses but stillclosed down 1.65 percent to book its lowest close in two weeksafter investors rushed to take profits on China's unexpectedtightening and after worries about some U.S. banks pushed WallStreet lower. Shanghai stocks ended flat after a volatile session whileHong Kong came off its lows in the morning session as investorstook China's first interest rate hike since 2007 in stride.

Some analysts said the market's reaction the previous daywas overblown, and with the Federal Reserve set to easemonetary policy further as early as next month, any dollarrebound would be short-lived. "What I think will be short-lived is the weakness in Asianand commodity currencies in particular," said Greg Gibbs, astrategist at RBS in Sydney. "I don't think the hike in China is too significant interms of actually slowing down growth there. I wouldn't viewthat as a factor to be getting bearish on risk or bearish onAsian growth." The People's Bank of China, the central bank, said it wouldlift its benchmark one-year lending and deposit rate, effectiveon Wednesday, in a move some analysts said may suggest Beijingand Washington are working together to ease global currencytensions. Crude oil prices rebounded after falling more than 4percent on the rate rise, while spot gold also stabilised at$1,340.00 after sharp falls. The yuan fell by more than 100 pips in morning trade to6.6558 per dollar, after the PBOC set the currency's mid-pointweaker in what was seen as an effort to prevent the interestrate rise from attracting more inflows of speculative capital.
