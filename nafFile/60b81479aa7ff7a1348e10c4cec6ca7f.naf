<raw><![CDATA[ * Weak US data, Treasury yield drop weighs on dollar * Greenback slides to record low vs Swiss franc * Kiwi rallies to another 3-year high By Masayuki Kitano and Antoni Slodkowski TOKYO, May 27 (Reuters) - The dollar tumbled broadly onFriday after weak U.S. economic data dragged the 10-yearTreasury yield down to a six-month low overnight, with thegreenback's drop gaining steam on a flurry of stop-lossselling. The dollar fell across the board, hitting a record lowagainst the Swiss franc and a three-year low versus the NewZealand dollar, with traders citing talk of dollar selling bymodel funds and U.S. banks, as well as Asian sovereign players. The dollar also retreated against emerging Asian currenciessuch as the Singapore dollar , and slid 0.6 percentversus a basket of major currencies to 75.107 , pullingaway from a two-month high of 76.366 hit earlier this week. The dollar had rallied earlier in May after a rout incommodities such as silver  and oil  spookedinvestors, prompting them to unwind dollar-funded bets on riskyassets. "Market players had flocked to dollar buying, based on theview that the dollar tends to rise when investors are lookingto avoid risk," said Kimihiko Tomita, head of foreign exchangefor State Street Global Markets in Tokyo. "But I think the market got a bit too carried away withthat theme," Tomita said. The dollar hit a record low against the Swiss franc of0.8534 francs on trading platform EBS, and was last down 1percent at 0.85740 . The New Zealand dollar marked a three-year high of $0.8200,coming within a whisker of a 26-year peak of $0.8215 hit inMarch 2008. It was last up 1.1 percent at $0.8186. The euro climbed 0.7 percent to $1.4244 , its risehaving gained momentum after hitting stops above the previousday's high near $1.4207. EYES ON U.S. DATA A drop in U.S. Treasury yields on Thursday dented thedollar, giving the single currency some respite from a recentsell-off on worries over the possibility of debt restructuringby Greece, which had sent the euro down to a two-month low of$1.3968 earlier this week. "The dollar has been strong since the start of May but itlooks like that outperformance may be coming to a close," saidJunya Tanase, foreign exchange strategist at JPMorgan Chase inTokyo. "Even if Greece's problems continue to weigh on the euro,if the dollar does not strengthen much, then the euro'sdownside against the dollar may gradually become limited," hesaid. The euro has turned higher after its drop this week stalledright near its 100-day moving average and also the bottom ofthe cloud on daily Ichimoku charts, a form of Japanesetechnical analysis popular among market players. But one cloud hanging over the euro is mounting concernover whether Greece will receive its next round of aid from theIMF. Comments on Thursday by Jean-Claude Juncker, president ofthe Eurogroup finance ministers, raised concerns that Greecemay not get the next 12 billion euros in aid from theInternational Monetary Fund that is needed to cover immediatefunding needs.[ID:nLDE74P1Z2] The dollar retreated after data on Thursday showed freshsigns of a slowdown in the U.S. labour market and the secondestimate of first quarter U.S. growth came in below forecasts,spurring a decline in the 10-year Treasury yield to a six-monthlow. [ID:nN26233734] "All eyes are on U.S. employment data out next Friday,"said Teppei Ino, currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-MitsubishiUFJ. "If those figures also come in below the market'sexpectations, the market may get excited about the possibilityof QE3 or some other form of monetary easing, putting morepressure on the dollar," Ino said. The 10-year Treasury yield stood last stood at 3.059percent . It hit a six-month low near 3.0530 percenton Thursday.
