<raw><![CDATA[ * BofA plans to repay $45 bln of TARP aid * Aussie dips after data adds little to RBA outlook * But record gold supports Australian dollar * Euro higher, but players wary of ECB meeting By Satomi Noguchi TOKYO, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The yen and the dollar fell onThursday after Bank of America said it would repay $45 billion oftaxpayer bailout funds, boosting investor confidence and trimmingsafety bids in those currencies. Bank of America is expected to repay its Troubled AssetRelief Program (TARP) funds over the next few days, withobservers saying this could be the first in a wave of suchpayments by major U.S. banks that have yet to give back thegovernment bailout money. Traders said the yen faced another wave of selling on the BoAmove after having been sold the previous day on growing investorspeculation that Japan may take more quantitative easing steps toget the economy out of deflation and as prospects of currencyintervention loomed large. The Australian dollar rose supported by record gold prices,but gains were capped by retail sales for October which matchedexpectations for a moderate increase. The data added little to the near-term outlook for monetarypolicy given that the Reserve Bank of Australia has just liftedits cash rate and that its next policy meeting is not untilFebruary, prompting some investors to sell the Aussie and bookprofits. Analysts at Barclays Capital said market appetite for riskcontinued to recover with several positive developments includingthe BofA move. "If the recovery in risk-correlated assets manages to getthrough the U.S. nonfarm payrolls release relatively unscathed,we think that there is a potential for a squeeze higher inrisk-correlated currencies into year-end," they said in a note toclients. The yen extended its fall as far as 87.89 per dollar, withstop-loss sell orders triggered around 87.50. It lost 0.9 percentin the previous session--its largest daily loss versus thegreenback in six weeks. That was a far cry from last week when the yen surged to a14-year high of 84.82 per dollar on trading platform EBS. It has lost ground steadily since then and traders now expectsupport for the yen at the 88 per dollar mark. "Suddenly the market does not want to touch yen," said DavidWatt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital. "As the focus in of the rest of the world continues to be onpotential exit strategies, headlines about a stimulus package,liquidity provisions from the Bank of Japan and a wall of wordsfrom concerned Japanese officials proliferate." Talk of intervention got a boost after Japanese PrimeMinister Yukio Hatoyama said on Wednesday the yen's recent risecould not be left alone.. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirofumi Hirano laterdownplayed Hatoyama's remarks, but that did not deter investorsfrom selling the yen. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) signalled on Wednesday it was open tomore measures to support the economy after its emergency meetingthe previous day offered short-term funding and disappointedmarkets. That has fanned expectations that it may take morequantitative easing steps. In general, quantitative easing undermines a currency's valuebecause it expands money supply to levels that could potentiallylead to higher inflation. ECB AWAITED The euro rose 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.5081 aheadof a key European Central Bank (ECB) meeting later in thesession. The single currency extended gains on the yen, rising to ashigh as 132.54 yen on EBS, before trading at 132.44 yen, up 0.7percent from late New York trade. The ECB is expected to keep rates unchanged but may signalits first step towards unwinding some of the emergency measurestaken last year to prop up the economy. For scenarios story, see. Still, with recent debt woes in Dubai lurking in thebackground, there were expectations that the ECB could delay itsplans to withdraw some of its liquidity operations. Any such movecould weigh on the euro. The Aussie was up 0.3 percent to $0.9282, but off earlierhighs near $0.9300. It rose 0.7 percent to 81.50 yen.
