<raw><![CDATA[ * BoE's growth forecasts look optimistic relative to others * Governor King says main worry is global economy * Inflation stands in way of further policy action for now  By Matt Falloon LONDON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The Bank of England is in danger ofoverestimating the strength of Britain's recovery, raising thechances it will have to inject more stimulus to counter theshock waves from Europe's debt crisis and the UK fiscal squeeze. Britain's economy has bounced back surprisingly well from an18-month recession and inflation has held well above the centralbank's two percent target this year, forcing many investors totake bets on further quantitative easing off the table. A Reuters poll on Wednesday showed only a third of analyststhink the BoE will restart its asset purchase scheme[ID:nLDE6AT1WQ] and a key manufacturing survey put activity at asix-year high and jobs growth at a record pace this month. But the Irish crisis, and fears that others in the euro zonemay soon need help, increase the risk that the BoE may need toact next year to support a recovery that was meant to be drivenby exports and a credit-reliant private sector. There is also a chance, as central bank dove Adam Posenargues, that the BoE has underestimated the impact of Britain'spush to all but eliminate a record budget deficit by 2015, whichstarts in earnest next year. "The economic recovery will be much weaker than the MonetaryPolicy Committee expects," said Vicky Redwood, a senior UKanalyst at Capital Economics.  "Once the signs that the financial problems (in Europe) aretranslating into big economic problems, then they'll start toget worried about the prospects for UK exports." The government wants to see the private sector expandrapidly to take up the slack as it slashes departmental spendingby about 20 percent over four years. Ministers also want arebalancing of the economy towards exports. It is in these areas where some of the biggest dangers lie.  With Britain's top export market -- Europe -- embroiled in asovereign debt crisis, there is a real danger that, despitesustained weakness in sterling, export demand will fail tosustain the recovery at rates which will drive economic growth. "Over 60 percent of our exports go to a part of the worldthat isn't exhibiting particularly buoyant growth and clearlyhas quite significant challenges within the area in terms ofsovereign debt," BoE Governor Mervyn King said this month. A private sector-led recovery also needs credit and therehas been little evidence that banks are eager to return topre-credit crunch levels of lending. Financial market ructions across Europe have not helped. "Recent events in the last month have made everyone morepessimistic," said Ray Barrell, director of macroeconomicresearch and forecasting at the National Institute of Economicand Social Research. "If the economy is significantly slower,they may have to think about it (QE) again."  COUNTARGUMENT: TIME TO TIGHTEN Some analysts and BoE hawk Andrew Sentance argue the centralbank has done enough already -- slashing interest rates to arecord low of 0.5 percent and embarking on an unprecedented 200billion pound ($312 billion) asset-buying spree which it haltedearlier this year. With inflation set to stay strong next year because of arise in VAT sales tax, they say the next move should be a slowtightening of interest rates to counter price pressures andmaintain confidence in the BoE's inflation-busting credentials. "There's been a huge amount of stimulus pumped into theeconomy," said George Buckley, an economist at Deutsche Bank."The balance of risks is moving away from more QE to rateincreases next year." But the central bank could argue that since it isforecasting inflation below target on the two-year horizon atwhich it calibrates policy it could embark on another round ofasset-buying with new money even if price pressures are high in2011. The Federal Reserve has already done so in the UnitedStates. The risks to the Bank's forecasts -- it is expecting theeconomy to expand by about 2.6 percent next year, acceleratingto more than 3 percent growth in 2012 and beyond -- are large. Those estimates, updated on Nov. 10, are among the highestout there. The consensus among economists is for growth of about1.9 percent in 2011 and around 1.8 percent in 2012. The Bank has proved too optimistic before. "They have had to slash their growth forecasts over the lastfew years," Buckley said. This week, Britain's independent Office for BudgetResponsibility, whose forecasts feed into fiscal policy, cut itsestimates for 2011 to 2.1 percent and for 2012 to 2.6 percent. If the BoE's forecasts are too high, inflation could falleven lower below target in the medium term and strengthen thecase for action. "It's premature to completely write it (more QE) off," saidMoyeen Islam, a gilts strategist at Barclays Capital.  "I think the market -- particularly if the fiscal problemsin Europe remain, and banks highlight the external risks to theeconomy from that -- might creep to pricing more QE in."
