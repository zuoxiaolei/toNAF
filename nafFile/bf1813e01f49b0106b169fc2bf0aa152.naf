<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen up 0.5 pct vs euro, dollar * Dollar below 200-day MA vs yen * MAS tightening weighs on dollar; Fed to stay put on QE2 By Natsuko Waki	 TOKYO, April 14 (Reuters) - The yen rose broadly on Thursdayas declines in Tokyo and other Asian shares prompted cutting ofstretched bets against the Japanese currency while the dollarindex held near a 16-month low on expectations the FederalReserve would keep its loose monetary policy.	 In flow-driven trading, the dollar briefly broke below its200-day moving average near 83.43 yen after investors lightenedsizeable long positions established after the U.S. currency'sspeedy ascent from its record low of 76.25 in March.	 The tone for dollar remained weak after Wednesday's U.S.retail sales data and Federal Reserve report did nothing tochange the view the central bank would keep its $600 billionasset buying programme until June.	 "It's driven by position adjustment as the move has been toofast. The dollar's quick rise of almost 10 yen has left sizeablelongs," said Osamu Takashima, chief FX strategist at Citibank.	 "The rise in U.S. yields has stopped and the focus is movingto when the Fed would actually raise interest rates after itends its QE2 policy in June. But it can't raise rates straightafter June."	 The dollar fell as low as 83.25 yen , moving furtheraway from its 6-1/2 month high around 85.55 set last week.	 Market players say as more Japanese exporters get productionlines up and running again, more will resume their dollar sales,which many had put on hold after the March 11 earthquake.	 The area around 85.40/85.95 represents a 50 percentretracement of the decline from its May peak, the Septemberhighs and a critical downtrend-line from the 2007 cycle high.	 The euro hit a session low of 120.18 yen , also offits 11-month high around 123.30 set this week.	 Tokyo and other  Asian equities fell around half a percent on the day, souringrisk sentiment and supporting the yen.	 The euro was trading at $1.4431 , below its 15-monthhigh of $1.4521. Mizuho Corporate Bank said the euro is testinga long-term channel resistance just ahead of pivotal resistanceat $1.4500. It said the Deutschmark never managed to hold aboveits equivalent to this level since exchange rates were floated.	  DOLLAR UNDER PRESSURE	 The dollar index, which measures its strength against majorcurrencies, was trading at 74.961 , just above its16-month low of 74.704 set on Wednesday. The index has lostaround 5 percent since January.	 "U.S. data overall was reasonable but the (Fed report)suggested uncertainty is rising. They did not offer big clues.The fact that the U.S. recovery is continuing will not become atrigger point for Fed policy," said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FXstrategist at Barclays Capital.	 "Unemployment, although improving, is still relatively highand the Fed is not going to bring forward the end of its loosemonetary policy. The dollar is finding no fresh factors to riseon."	 Stronger-than-expected growth data from Singapore and thecentral bank's move to let its currency rise against the dollarin monetary tightening reflected strong inflationary pressuresin booming emerging economies, a factor that could weigh on theU.S. currency [ID:nSFK000031].	 Goldman Sachs said its models suggested the dollar is nowabout 13 percent cheaper than its fair value on a trade-weightedbasis. However, only four out of 32 currencies of U.S. tradingpartners weakened against the dollar this year, which Goldmansaid would offer comfort to policymakers.
