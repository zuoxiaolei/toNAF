<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro's rises seen limited in short term * Portuguese bond sale eyed, followed by Spanish auction * Aussie down on worries over floods' impact on growth By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The euro made thin gains onWednesday, extending this week's rebound but with limited abilityto rise much as caution gripped the market ahead of debt sales byhighly indebted euro zone countries. Portugal is due to tap bond investors on Wednesday whileSpain is seeking to sell up to 3 billion euros ($3.89 billion)worth on Thursday. Markets are keen to see if they can obtainfunding at a sustainable cost or if they will be forced to turnto the European Union and IMF for help. "If Portugal has to pay over 7 percent it will be inevitablefor it to ask for help," said a trader at a Japanese bank. For now though the common currency is enjoying a reprieveafter euro zone sources said the region's finance ministers arelikely next week to consider the option of raising the effectivelending capacity of the currency bloc's rescue fund as part ofefforts to calm jittery markets. This follows Japan's promise to support an upcoming euro zonebond sale and talk that the European Central Bank had bought debtto help stabilise markets. The common currency gained 0.2 percent on the day to reclaimthe $1.30 level, edging up further from a four-month trough ofaround $1.2860 hit on Monday. The dollar's weakness against Asian and other emergingeconomy currencies is indirectly helping the euro, a U.S. banktrader said. Attempts to take out stop-loss orders said to be lurkingabove $1.30 were countered by offers by an Asian central bank,traders said. Further resistance is seen at its Dec. 23 low of $1.3055 andthe 200-day moving average around $1.3070, and many traders seelittle chance of the euro rising above those levels in the nearterm. BNP Paribas strategists said in a report that they expect theeuro's rise to remain limited to $1.3000/40, which would providerenewed selling opportunities with a target for a break below$1.2875 and then $1.2590. The immediate focus is on Wednesday's debt sale by Portugal,widely seen as the next euro zone weakling to seek a bailoutafter Greece and Ireland. Lisbon will likely need to offer record high premiums toplace its debt, although recent bond buying by the EuropeanCentral Bank has helped drive down the yield on Portugal'sbenchmark 10-year bond to below 7 percent from euro lifetimehighs of 7.3 percent last week. Against the yen, the single European currency rose 0.3percent to 108.35 yen, well off four-month lows around 106.81 seton Monday. As the euro recovered, the dollar index, which tracks theperformance of the greenback against a basket of majorcurrencies, slipped 0.2 percent to 80.63, off a five-week higharound 81.313 set on Monday. Versus the yen, the dollar was little moved at 83.27 yen,though it held well above this week's low around 82.66, withgains in global stocks weighing on demand for the yen. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar hit a fresh one-month lowaround $0.9803, though option triggers at $0.98 helped it limpback to $0.9860. Mounting worries that massive floods in northeast Australiacould hamper growth were taking a toll on the Aussie, knocking itfurther from a 28-year high around $1.0250 set on Dec. 31. Warwick McKibbin, a Reserve Bank of Australia board member,was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald as saying the floodscould cut economic growth by up to 1 percentage point. Estimates by other economists were less grim, though, withmany expecting the floods could at most knock 0.5 percentagepoint off growth.
