<raw><![CDATA[ * WTO chief says Doha "early harvest" unlikely * Reiterates need to accelerate Doha negotiations By George Obulutsa DAR ES SALAAM, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Poor countries will haveto wait for the Doha Round of trade talks to conclude and areunlikely to get an advanced package directed to them beforethen, the head of the World Trade Organisation said onSaturday. Some Least Developed Countries (LDCs) have called for an"early harvest" of measures to benefit them as downpayment fora deal in the talks, already in their 8th year. These would include proposals already widely accepted, suchas giving poor countries duty-free, quota-free access for theirexports to richer countries. The Doha talks, launched in late 2001 to boost world tradeby slashing farm subsidies and agricultural and industrialtariffs to help poor countries prosper, are already thelongest-running trade round. But rich economies such as the United States and EuropeanUnion want the whole round of negotiations to end, so thatmeasures benefiting poor countries are part of an overallpackage. "For the moment there is no mandated 'early harvest',contrary to previous negotiations in the past," WTODirector-General Pascal Lamy told Reuters in an interview. "Least developed countries would wish this, other membersfor the moment have resisted this. So the situation as it isfor the moment is benefits of the round for Least DevelopedCountries will occur at the conclusion of the round." Leaders of the G20 rich and emerging countries have calledfor a conclusion of the Doha round next year, and negotiatorsare working hard in Geneva to close the gaps. But Lamy told a meeting of LDC trade ministers on Fridaythat it would be hard to meet that deadline given the pace oftalks.. "My sense is that we still need to accelerate. We need toaccelerate if we need this 2010 horizon to be met," he said. "Developing countries are of the view, and this wasre-expressed here by the LDCs, that this should be wrapped upas soon as possible." Estimates of the value of an agreement, which would bephased over several years, vary. The most recent, byWashington's Peterson Institute for International Economics,says it could raise world GDP by $300-700 billion a year. For developing countries, one of the critical componentswould be cuts in rich countries' subsidies for cotton thatdistort the market and hurt their farmers. They are pushing forbigger cuts in cotton subsidies than other farm products. This week LDC trade ministers urged other WTO members toset up a safety net for poor-country cotton producers to helpthem cope with losses caused by the economic crisis.
