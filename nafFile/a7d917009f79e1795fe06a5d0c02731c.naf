<raw><![CDATA[ WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Two U.S. lawmakers called onThursday for a government report on the economy-wide effects ofa 35 percent tariff that President Barack Obama imposed on tireimports from China. "I am concerned that the administration's tire tax willcost us jobs in the United States and raise prices for tiresfor hardworking Americans," Representative Kevin Brady, a TexasRepublican, said in a statement. "I want to make sure that the administration has all thefacts so that it can best determine how and when to end thattax," Brady said. Obama imposed the import tax in September at the behest ofunion workers at U.S. tire plants who said their jobs werethreatened by imports from China. None of their employersrequested the relief. The duty declines to 30 percent in the second year and 25percent in the third, after which it is scheduled to beremoved. Brady said the administration should consider ending thetax earlier if it is hurting American consumers and notdelivering promised new jobs. He and Representative Dan Boren, an Oklahoma Democrat,urged U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk to establish acomprehensive monitoring system to assess the impact of theimport tax on U.S. employment, tire prices and auto safety. They said they had seen reports of significant tire priceincreases in many areas of the country, including poorerneighborhoods, and anecdotal evidence of layoffs in tiredistribution and retail sectors. A spokeswoman for Kirk's office said it was reviewing thelawmaker's letter. (Reporting by Doug Palmer; Editing by Peter Cooney)             ]]></raw>
