<raw><![CDATA[ (Repeat of item initially transmitted Sunday, Nov 7) By Emily Kaiser WASHINGTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The Group of 20 is beginningto look more like the G19 plus 1 as emerging and rich countriesalike accuse the United States of breaking a vow of unity. This week's G20 summit will require every bit of PresidentBarack Obama's diplomacy skills after the Federal Reserveembarked on a new $600 billion bond-buying spree, sparkingcriticism from four continents that the U.S. central bank wasignoring the global repercussions. Officials from Germany, Brazil, China and South Africa wereamong those expressing concern that the Fed's money printingcould weaken the dollar, drive up commodity prices and senduncontrollable waves of investor cash into emerging markets. If the G20 fails to defuse these global tensions, it mayheighten investor concerns that policymakers are driftingfurther apart, leaving the world economy vulnerable to anotherbout of upheaval. Domestic politics and policies make Obama's job tougher. He arrives in Seoul for the Nov. 11-12 summit weakened by acrushing congressional election defeat for his DemocraticParty. His primary task will be to convince his peers the Fed'sactions do not run counter to a U.S.-led push for globalcooperation to even out economic imbalances. (For a graphic on G20 economies, seehttp://link.reuters.com/tah43q) South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said theFed's move "undermines the spirit of multilateral cooperationthat G20 leaders have fought so hard to maintain during thecurrent crisis." German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was lessdiplomatic. He called U.S. policy "clueless." It was less than five months ago that G20 leaders gatheredin Toronto, talking in warm and fuzzy terms about "collectivewell-being" and "shared objectives." "G20 members have a responsibility to the community ofnations to assure the overall health of the global economy,"the leaders said in their closing statement in June. "If we act in a coordinated manner, all regions are betteroff, now and in the future." G20 PLUS QE2 = CATCH 22 Since that Toronto meeting, the dollar has dropped 11percent against a basket of currencies, driving up currenciesin Japan, Brazil, the euro zone and elsewhere. The biggestexception is China, where the tightly managed yuan has gained arelatively modest 2 percent versus the dollar since late June. Obama's response to G20 criticism is expected to be thatthe world needs a healthy U.S. economy, and the U.S. economyneeds healthier exports. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke himself said a strong U.S.economy was critical for the global recovery, and his centralbank was well aware of the dollar's "special role" in theglobal economy and monetary system. Indeed, G20 members all seem to agree that the world needsa better balance between cash-rich exporters such as China andGermany and heavily indebted consumer countries like the UnitedStates. The difference lies in how best to accomplish that. For emerging markets fearful that the Fed's flood of cashwill swamp their economies, the United States does not seem tobe keeping up its end of the "shared objectives" bargain. That makes it harder for Washington to push for policychanges elsewhere, particular in Beijing, which insists theyuan is not the primary culprit behind big global trade gaps.Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's proposal to set numericaltargets limiting current account imbalances was roundlyrejected at a G20 finance ministers meeting last month. The Obama administration was the driving force behind aproposal adopted by the G20 in Pittsburgh last year to promotemore balanced global growth. That framework may be the best bet for G20 consensus atthis week's Seoul summit. Unlike Geithner's numerical targets, the framework forbalanced growth calls for mutual assessments to ensure domesticpolicies don't disrupt global growth. G20 countries submitted their medium-term economic plansfor International Monetary Fund review last month. Leaders mayagree to keep this process going beyond Seoul, keeping the IMFas arbiter. The Fund told the G20 nations in June that if they adoptmutually supportive policies, they could raise global output by$4 trillion and create 52 million jobs in the medium term. Unless leaders can put on a convincing show of cooperationin Seoul this week, those loftier economic goals may remainwell out of reach. (Editing by Dan Grebler)             ]]></raw>
