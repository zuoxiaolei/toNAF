<raw><![CDATA[ By Emma Graham-Harrison and Angie Ramos COPENHAGEN, Dec 17 (Reuters) - China said on Thursday a U.S.pledge to mobilise $100 billion a year in climate funds was a"good step", and signalled Beijing was seeking compromise withWashington on its demand for checks on Chinese emissions curbs. But Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, bearing a message fromPremier Wen Jiabao, warned that the U.N.-led negotiations inCopenhagen were at a critical stage and could be wrecked if the193 countries taking part didn't pull together.  The Dec 7-18 summit is officially due to wrap up a new dealto tackle global warming on Friday, but rifts between rich andpoor nations over everything from funding to which draft dealshould be on the table, have made for agonisingly slow progress. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to break thedeadlock on Thursday with a pledge to help mobilise the $100billion a year by 2020 to assist poor nations shift to greenergrowth and adapt to a warmer world. China's He, who had previously said finance was China's topconcern at the talks, said the move was positive. "I think the financial issue is very important. Whateverinitiative these countries will announce is a good step," Hetold Reuters when asked about the U.S. announcement. He also suggested that China was working towards a deal oncontrols of its emissions curbing efforts that would satisfyU.S. concerns. Another official earlier said the two countrieswere having regular and productive bilateral meetings. "In terms of mitigation actions (emissions curbs), we canalso consider, international exchange, dialogue and cooperationthat is not intrusive and does not infringe upon oursovereignty," He said. Clinton had pointedly warned China it must accept toughrequirements for monitoring, reporting and verification, if theUnited States is to provide the promised aid. U.S. officials have likened the demands for accountabilityto verification requirements that have been the hallmark of pastnuclear arms reduction treaties and trade deals. China has previously said that it would only accept checkson emissions efforts paid for by international funds. But Heused softer language and also suggested greater use of a UNscheme that could overcome worries about sovereignty. "We are willing to enhance and improve the ways we donational communications, whose purpose of course is to enhancetransparency," He said, referring to the regular reports onemissions levels that countries which signed up to the KyotoProtocol are meant to submit to the United Nations periodically. Stepping up these could overcome one of China's chiefconcerns, that checks could infringe on its sovereignty. He also said that China's target would be binding underdomestic law and the country would step up its own checks. (Editing by Dominic Evans)             ]]></raw>
