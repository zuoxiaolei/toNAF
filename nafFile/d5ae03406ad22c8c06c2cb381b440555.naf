<raw><![CDATA[Investing.com – Asian stock markets rose on Monday as resources shares advanced and after better-than expected U.S. jobs data boosted hopes that the world's largest economy was recovering steadily. Shortly before the European trading session, South Korea's Kospi Composite Index climbed 1.56%; the Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.73%; and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 2.08%.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index rose 2.09% after official data showed that a record rise in exports helped the country's current-account balance swing back to surplus in January.  Australia's S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.85%, helped by miners BHP Billiton, which rose 2.5%, and Rio Tinto, which advanced 2.4%, as resources stocks were broadly up after crude oil prices and metals held most of their gains from last week.  On Friday, U.S. Labor Department data showed that employers cut fewer jobs than expected in February, in a sign that the U.S. economy may be strong enough to start creating new jobs soon.  The outlook for European markets, meanwhile, was rosy: France’s CAC 40 futures indicated a rise of 0.34%; Germany's DAX futures pointed to an increase of 0.34%; EURO STOXX 50 futures indicated a rise of 0.58%; and Britain's FTSE 100 futures pointed to an increase of 0.44%.             ]]></raw>
