<raw><![CDATA[ * Mounting crisis in Libya prompts investors to cut risk * Profit-taking pressures euro and sterling - trader * Kiwi tumbles; quake in NZ stirs rate cut talk * Limited impact after Moody's cuts outlook for Japansovereign rating (Updates price levels)	 By Hideyuki Sano and Masayuki Kitano	 TOKYO/SINGAPORE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The dollar rose broadlyand the New Zealand dollar tumbled on Tuesday as mountingtension in the Middle East and a deadly earthquake in NewZealand drove investors to cut risk.	 Investors were spooked by the unrest in Libya, where forcesloyal to leader Muammar Gaddafi have fought an increasinglybloody battle to keep the veteran leader in power. 	 The rising tensions have sparked a surge in oil prices,weighed on Asian shares and currencies and triggeredprofit-taking in currencies that have rallied recently such asthe sterling and the euro, market players said.	 Robert Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas in Singapore, saidthe drop in emerging Asian currencies on Tuesday was likelyprompted by a knee-jerk move to cut back on risk-taking.	 But there could be a more enduring impact on majorcurrencies such as sterling and the euro if the rise in oilprices persists, he said.	 "The idea of higher oil prices, particularly in Europe, isnot going to be positive. The UK and Europe are going to suffer... They are already in trouble with inflation with very lowgrowth," Ryan said.	 "If they have to raise interest rates not because ofeconomic growth but because of inflation fears that is hardlypositive," he said, adding that sterling in particular could bevulnerable.	 The dollar climbed 0.5 percent against a basket of majorcurrencies to 78.089 , and now faces resistance rightbelow 78.200, where the conversion line and base line come in ondaily Ichimoku charts.	 Short-covering likely helped to amplify the dollar's gains,said a trader for a major Japanese bank in Singapore.	 "Dollar selling had accelerated last week in line with adrop in U.S. yields... I think the market was probably tiltedtoward short dollar positions and that some dollarshort-covering is taking place now," he said.	 Middle East tensions were likely to remain in the spotlightfollowing news that two Iranian ships entered the Suez Canal onTuesday and were heading toward the Mediterranean, a movecertain to anger Israel. 	 But it is far from clear that the short-covering in thedollar will persist, said the trader for a major Japanese bank,adding that moves in U.S. bond yields would be key to thedollar's near-term fortunes.	 "What may happen is that U.S. Treasuries could attractflight-to-safety buying and U.S. bond yields may fall and putsome pressure on the dollar," he said.	 U.S. financial markets will resume trade on Tuesday afterhaving been shut on Monday for a national holiday.	  KIWI SLIDES AFTER EARTHQUAKE 	 One of the sharpest moves was in the New Zealand dollar,which slid 1.8 percent to $0.7498 after a strong quakehit New Zealand's second-biggest city of Christchurch, andstirred talk the country's central bank may soon lower interestrates.	 Westpac Bank said the Reserve Bank of New Zealand may cutthe official cash rate to shore up confidence, adding that sucha rate cut may occur at or before a policy meeting on March 10. 	 The kiwi has initial support at the lower Bollinger Bandthat now lies at $0.7493. Below that its 200-day moving averageoffers support at $0.7355.	 Sterling fell 0.4 percent to $1.6168 , while theeuro slid 0.7 percent to $1.3588 and fell 0.4 percentagainst the yen to 113.25 yen .	 The single currency has lacked the vigour to break above keyresistance after Germany's main ruling party suffered a crushingdefeat at a regional election in the city-state of Hamburg onSunday.	 One trader said there could be further selling of the euroif the single currency were to drop below 112.50 yen.	 The dollar gained ground against the yen as its broad rallygathered steam, and rose 0.2 percent to 82.34 yen .	 The yen and Japanese government bonds took in their stridenews that Moody's Investors Service had cut its outlook onJapan's Aa2 sovereign rating to negative from stable, with10-year JGB futures holding on to their gains and the yen higheron crosses despite Moody's decision. 	 Koichi Haji, chief economist at NLI Research Institute,warned that the outlook change could be negative for the yen andJGBs down the road.	 "The markets may take a body blow from the downgrade in the 	mid-term if not short-term," Haji said.	 "If there is uncertainty over the passage of next fiscal 	year's budget and related bills, there may be some repercussions	such as domestic investors' reluctance to buy Japanesegovernment bonds by the end of the fiscal year," Haji said.
