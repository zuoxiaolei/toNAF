<raw><![CDATA[ * France, Germany, others say oppose EU GM crop proposals * Trade, internal market questions top list of concerns By Charlie Dunmore BRUSSELS, 27 Sept (Reuters) - Proposals to let EU statesdecide for themselves whether to grow or ban geneticallymodified (GM) crops suffered a big setback on Monday as many ofthe bloc's largest governments confirmed they opposed the plans. To pass, the proposals put forward by the EuropeanCommission in July will need the support of a majority ofEuropean Union states and lawmakers under the bloc's weightedvoting system, which gives larger states a greater say in thefinal decision. At a meeting of EU farm ministers in Brussels on Monday,Germany, France, Italy, and Spain all expressed grave doubtsover the viability of the plan, and questioned its conformitywith the bloc's internal market rules. "I don't think that we can expect a compromise or aconsensus over the next couple of months -- a great deal morework is going to have to be done," Belgian agriculture ministerSabine Laruelle, who chaired the meeting, said afterwards. Belgium, which currently holds the rotating presidency ofthe 27-nation EU, had asked the ministers whether they felt theproposals were compatible with the bloc's internal market andWorld Trade Organization (WTO) rules. "The German reply was very short indeed -- 'no, and no'," anEU source in the meeting told reporters. France, Spain and Italy said they want decisions on GM cropsto continue to be taken collectively at EU level, as at present. "We believe that moving to national decisions wouldrepresent a breach (of EU decision making) that would bedangerous for economic reasons, health reasons and for politicaland social reasons," French farm minister Bruno Le Maire toldjournalists before the meeting. Even Belgium broke with the tradition of remaining impartialas holders of the EU presidency, after Laruelle said at a pressconference that the country's position was "similar to thatexpressed by France and others".  Austria, Hungary and the Netherlands were among the fewcountries to express support for the plans during the debate,sources said. Britain, while frustrated by the current impasse between EUgovernments over GM crop approvals, said it needed greater legalclarity on the proposals before taking a position.  DALLI DEFENDS PLANS EU health and consumer chief John Dalli defended theproposals, and said he still hoped a deal could be reached inthe coming months. "I am confident that the approach proposed by the Commissionis a balanced one, it does not undermine the internal market andis not in contradiction with the WTO rules," he said. In fact, the EU's current stance on GM crops -- with sixcountries maintaining national "safeguard" bans on cultivation-- was a greater trade concern, he said, and placed the EU in "avery weak position" within the WTO. But Dalli stressed that the proposals were open for debateand could be adapted to reach an agreement between EUgovernments and lawmakers. EU environment ministers are due to debate the plans on Oct.14, while the European Parliament will begin its deliberationsin the coming months. But given the strong opposition of the EU's largest memberstates and the few signs of support from the rest, there islittle to suggest an agreement will be reached soon, if at all.
