<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro off early high, good support under $1.36 * IMM position suggests rally likely to slow but not stop * Fall in euro zone credit spreads contrasts with U.S. * Rising interest rate gaps help euro By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The euro backed away from anine-week high on profit-taking on Monday, though easing eurozone debt worries supported the single currency. The euro held above key resistance around $1.3570 that itbroke on Friday, a 50 percent retracement of its decline fromNovember to early this month, as data showed speculators haveclosed all their bets against the currency. Speculators turned long on the euro for the first time intwo months in the week ended Jan. 18 while doubling their betsagainst the greenback, figures from the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission showed on Friday. "After speculators flip their positionings, they tend tobuild up more of their new positions for some time. So the eurostill looks to be on a rising trend to me," said a trader at aJapanese bank. The euro last traded at $1.3596, having briefly hit afresh two-month high at $1.3648 in early Australasian trade onMonday, compared with around $1.3620 late in New York on Friday. The currency piercing resistance around $1.3570 brings intoview $1.3740, a 61.8 percent retracement of its decline fromNovember to early this month. The euro has rallied some 6 percent in the past two weeks asdemand from Asian central banks spurred wider buying in thecommon currency. But as the CFTC data shows speculators no longer have shortpositions that need to be closed, the euro's momentum is likelyto slow, some market players said. "As we can't expect more short-covering, the euro no longerhas an engine for its rally," says a trader at a Japanesebrokerage. Thus the news that Ireland's junior coalition party withdrewfrom Prime Minister Brian Cowen's government on Sunday,hastening an election due on March 11, was enough to triggerprofit-taking. "Above $1.36 on euro and, while we're not quite there yet,sub-78 on the DXY, and I'd begin to think it's overdone. Still,it's hard to see what the catalyst is to change minds," saidRobert Rennie, a currency strategist at Westpac Bank. Euro bears were wary of becoming too negative having beenbadly burnt in the last couple of weeks. "I don't think sovereign debt problems will go away but thething is Europe does have a safety net already," said MinoriUchida, senior analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. "And on the other hand it is not as if the U.S. doesn't havefiscal problems. Its deficit is widening sharply on planned taxcuts and the finances of many of its states are strained. Isuspect there will be a time later this year when the marketwill focus on U.S. debt problems," he added. The premium on 10-year credit default swaps on U.S.sovereign debt hit a near-two-year high last week and U.S.municipal bonds have been under pressure for some time. While the level of the credit spread on U.S. sovereign debtis still low, its recent rise contrasted with a fall in creditspreads in Italy, Spain and Portugal in the past couple ofweeks. The euro drew additional help from tough talk on keepinginflation in check from European Central Bank chief Jean-ClaudeTrichet. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal onSunday, Trichet said core inflation was not a good gauge offuture price pressures and that the central bank was ensuringhigher energy prices do not seep into other prices. In contrast, the U.S. Federal Reserve is more worried aboutreviving the job market and the Fed statement on Wednesday islikely to give only a sober assessment of the sluggish recovery. This has helped drive euro zone benchmark German 2-yearyields to one-year highs and pushed its spread to theequivalent U.S. yield to the widest in about two years, makingthe euro more attractive against the dollar for some investors. Against the yen, the single currency was last at 112.50 yen,having hit a two-month high of 112.63 in choppy early trade andrising above its 200-day moving average for the first time inover a year. Against the Swiss franc, the euro also held near Friday's1-Â½   month high of 1.3068 franc, standing at 1.3041.     Thecommon currency also hit a two-month high against the Australiandollar near A$1.38. "We'll be watching to see if this momentum remains in place.With periphery issues no longer fully offsetting the improving(at least in Germany) macro backdrop, watch the deck of eurozone PMIs due on Monday," said David Watt, strategist at RBCCapital Markets. The euro's rebound has left the dollar languishing neartwo-month lows against a basket of major currencies. The dollarindex last traded at 78.256, not far from a two-month low of78.096 hit on Friday. The dollar bought 82.75 yen, trapped in a rangeroughly between 81 yen and 84 yen seen so far this month. The Australian dollar slipped 0.2 percent to $0.9878, dentedby lower-than-expected Australian producer prices.
