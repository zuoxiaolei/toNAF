<raw><![CDATA[ * Sweden faces parliamentary election on Sept. 19 * Minority government could unsettle markets * Analysts believe negative reaction would be brief  By Niklas Pollard STOCKHOLM, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Sweden's election next monthmay produce a hung parliament with a far-right party holding thebalance of power, setting the stage for a minority governmentand an intense, but brief, period of market volatility. Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and his four-partycentre-right coalition is seeking re-election on Sept. 19 andopinion polls show it faces a close contest with the mainopposition Social Democrat-led centre-left bloc. The polls tend to show Reinfeldt leading, but six out of 10forecast he will not have a majority if the far-rightanti-immigrant Swedish Democrats win their first parliamentseats in a country renowned for its tolerance. A minority government would not be a shock in Sweden, whichhas been ruled by them for most of the democratic era, but itwould still shake markets. "The halo that to some extent is resting on the Swedisheconomy would be knocked slightly askew," said TorbjornIsaksson, chief analyst at the Nordea bank. "Uncertainty is never good and I think this would feedthrough to the market in form of higher debt yields and a weakercrown." The economic recovery has been stronger in Sweden thanelsewhere in the European Union and the government isforecasting 4.5 percent growth this year. Its public financesare also much more robust. In such circumstances, the Swedish crown has strengthenednearly 9 percent against the euro this year while 10-year debtyields have eased more than 30 percent. If a hung parliamentemerges, the winning streak may fade. "There would be an initial strong negative reaction ahead ofparliamentary negotiations to form a new government and ahead ofthe autumn budget," Swedbank economist Knut Hallberg said. He and SEB chief economist Robert Bergqvist said the scaleof the market reaction would partly depend on how much theoutcome differed from opinion polls in the run-up to the voteand believe the negative reaction will wear off quickly. "There could be a political vacuum after election night, butI think this would be filled pretty quickly," Bergqvist said. "I think we would see a short-lived market impact somewhatdepending on how fast the issue of forming a new government isresolved." The crown traded at 9.37 to the euro on Friday while Swedishbenchmark 10-year bond yields stood at 2.219, 11 points aboveits German counterpart.  MINORITY GOVERNMENTS BEFORE The established parties have said they will not work withthe Sweden Democrats. This means that if Reinfeldt wins but hasno majority in the 349-seat parliament, he will probably form aminority government. This could occur if the Sweden Democrats win at least fourpercent of total votes cast, the minimum needed to enterparliament, which would ensure them about 14 seats. Minority government rule in Sweden has mostly been in theform of Social Democratic cabinets, and in recent yearslegislation has been revised to give such governments greaterinfluence. The new rules, introduced after a destabilising politicallog-jam during Sweden's economic crisis in the early 1990s, meana government's budget is rejected only if the opposition uniteson a comprehensive alternative bill. If the Sweden Democrats were isolated, a united oppositionvote against a minority government budget or to push through avote of no confidence would be unlikely. A second term of majority government for Reinfeldt wouldhave little effect on money and debt markets, political analystssaid, while a slightly more expansionary centre-left fiscalpolicy could put some slight pressure on debt yields and thecrown. Indeed, it may not be Swedish politics that pose the mainrisk for the country's rosy growth prospects. "The main risk for the Swedish economic outlook is comingfrom the euro zone," said BNP Paribas economist Gizem Kara,referring to the fact that export-heavy Sweden derives muchgrowth from euro zone demand.
