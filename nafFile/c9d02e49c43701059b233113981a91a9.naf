<raw><![CDATA[ (For more stories on the Chinese economy, click [ID:nECONCN]) BEIJING, Oct 22 (Reuters) - China should use the yuan'sexchange rate as one of its main tools for fine-tuning monetarypolicy in coming months, a government economist said in commentspublished on Thursday. China has effectively repegged the yuan  to thedollar since July last year when the global financial crisisworsened, but the strength of the economy's recovery hasattracted capital inflows and placed upward pressure on thecurrency. Beijing sent a clear message on Wednesday that it wouldgradually unwind its ultra-loose pro-growth policies -- of whicha stable exchange rate has been a key one -- but the marketexpects it to allow only minimal yuan appreciation over the nextyear. [ID:nPEK230597] "Maintaining the appropriately loose thrust, we should usemonetary, regulatory and exchange rate tools to implementstructural fine-tuning," Chen Daofu, an economist with theDevelopment Research Centre, a think-tank under the cabinet, wascited as saying in the official China Securities Journal. The State Council, China's cabinet, said the economy hadperformed better than expected in the first nine months of theyear and that recovery had been "consolidated", a shift inrhetoric that lays the ground for policy adjustment.

But Chen said that inflationary pressure, whether at theconsumer or producer level, was not especially great. Instead, hesaid policymakers should focus on volatile asset prices,commodity prices and monetary conditions. Separately, the newspaper said in a front-page article thattalk of "credit tightening" was again swirling in the market. China has used strict quotas in the past to control banklending, though it has resorted mainly to moral suasion in recentmonths to rein in banks after a record surge of credit in thefirst half of the year. A loan officer at an unnamed commercial bank was quoted assaying that its head office had made it much harder to approveloans since September and demanded more collateral fromborrowers.
