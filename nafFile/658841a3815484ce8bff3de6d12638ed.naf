<raw><![CDATA[ * Yen slips as short-term players trim positions * Meeting between Japan PM, BOJ governor weighs on yen * Euro initially climbs as stops above $1.3375 triggered * But euro struggles as Greek worries fester By Satomi Noguchi TOKYO, April 9 (Reuters) - The yen retreated on Friday onselling by short-term players on the view that the currency'srise the previous day on talk of a near-term yuan revaluation wasoverdone. The euro rose earlier as investors trimmed record-high shortpositions, but the single currency struggled to keep those gainsas worries about debt-laden Greece simmered in the background. The yen was also under pressure as Japanese Prime MinisterYukio Hatoyama and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa helda meeting on Friday, the first of regular talks between thegovernment and the central bank. The outcome of the meeting offered no new trading incentivesbut reminded the market that the BOJ will likely continue facinggovernment pressure to take further action to fight deflation.[ID:nTKX006741] [nTKZ006422] "What matters for the market is how this meeting will likelyimpact BOJ policy meetings in the coming months, including thenext one at the end of the month," said a trader for a bigJapanese bank. The meeting came just two days after the central bank decidedto hold off on new policy initiatives and gave a slightly morepositive view than before on the economy. The dollar rose 0.2 percent from late New York trade to 93.54yen , recovering from Thursday's low of 92.83 yen ontrading platform EBS. It was helped by demand from Japanesecompanies and gains in other currencies versus the yen, traderssaid. The greenback had pulled back from a seven-month high of94.78 yen hit on Monday as traders sped up their yen-buying amidspeculation that a revaluation of the Chinese yuan could comebefore China's president visits Washington early next week. Asian currencies are seen likely to gain from any move byChina to revalue its currency and the yen is perceived as a majorproxy for those regional units.  The euro briefly extended its recovery from Thursday's low of$1.3282 after European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichetassured markets that a Greece default is unlikely, prompting somesovereign names to pick up the battered euro in the New Yorksession. But the euro quickly erased its gains and fell 0.1 percent to$1.3346  as sentiment towards the single currency remainsweak. Against the yen, the euro  stood at 124.88 yen, up0.1 percent on the day and above the previous day's low of 123.43yen, but struggled to keep gains above 125 yen. "Greece remains a focus in FX markets," JP Morgan said in areport. "The next test is Greece's launch of its next bond issue.So far, no date has been given, but they will require 10 billioneuros to meet May refunding." The dollar index  <=USD> was steady at 81.543. Speculation about a firmer Chinese yuan has reached feverpitch since The New York Times said China was close to announcinga shift in policy involving a "small but immediate" yuanrevaluation.
