<raw><![CDATA[ *Risk currencies recovering after positive U.S. payrolls *Dollar looks vulnerable against yen near 15-yr low *Kiwi down slightly after earthquake By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive onMonday after firm U.S. payrolls data last week eased marketanxiety over chances of a double-dip recession and boosted demandfor the euro and growth-leveraged currencies. The dollar looked vulnerable against the yen after failing tomaintain its gains following Friday's payrolls data, thoughcaution about Japanese intervention deterred further yen buying. "Looking at price actions after Friday's payrolls data,people seemed to have been well-prepared for a rebound in thedollar/yen. Thus the dollar will be capped for now," said atrader at a Japanese bank. "But on the other hand, we don't have strong reasons to buythe yen either. I expect the dollar/yen to be stuck in a narrowrange," the trader said. The euro changed hands at $1.2885, having risen to $1.2898after the payrolls data on Friday, its highest in two weeks. Itfaces resistance around $1.2920-35. U.S. non-farm payrolls fell 54,000, the Labor Departmentsaid, a much smaller drop than the predicted 100,000. Privateemployment, considered a better gauge of labour market health,increased 67,000. The Australian dollar fetched $0.9155, down from late U.S.levels last week but still near a four-week high around $0.9176hit after the U.S. payrolls figures. The yen stood at 84.45 yen per dollar, not far from a 15-yearpeak of 83.58 hit late last month. The yen has been bought in the past few months as investorstend to favour currencies of countries with a current accountsurplus when they want to avoid risky assets. Positive balance of payments figures also mean dollar sellingby Japanese exporters constantly outweighs dollar buying byJapanese importers, capping the dollar versus the yen. The dollar/yen has had a very high correlation with U.S.yield levels in recent months. The lower U.S. yields are, thecheaper the dollar is against the yen, as lower yields tend todiscourage investment in the dollar. On Friday, however, the dollar did not make much headwayagainst the yen even as the payrolls data pushed U.S. yieldssharply higher. Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commissionshowed on Friday that currency speculators trimmed their longpositions on the yen last week but they still have big yen longpositions. Their long positions were cut to 49,904 from 51,069 contractsthe week before. Still, some analysts say the dollar could eventually gain. "The U.S. dollar appears to be rebounding, which could makefor a rise in the dollar/yen to 85-86 yen," said MasafumiYamamoto, chief FX strategist at Barclays. The New Zealand dollar dipped slightly at $0.7190, offFriday's four-week peak of $0.7218 after a magnitude 7.1earthquake struck the country's second-largest city,Christchurch, causing widespread damage to infrastructure.
