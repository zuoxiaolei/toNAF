<raw><![CDATA[ WASHINGTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress movedcloser on Friday to approving an extension of soon-to-expiretrade benefits for a long list of developing countries,including Colombia, Peru and Ecuador. Senior Democrats on the House of Representatives Ways andMeans Committee introduced a bill to extend both the U.S.Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and a separate programfor three countries in the Andean region for one year. That followed talks with Ways and Means Republicans andDemocratic and Republican leaders of the Senate FinanceCommittee, which also has jurisdiction over trade. The House is expected to pass the package next week andsend it to the Senate for final approval before lawmakersadjourn for the holidays, a congressional aide said. Both programs are set to expire Dec 31. The GSP program gives 131 developing countries preferentialaccess to the United States by waiving duties on nearly 3,500goods. Forty-four of the world's poorest countries receiveduty-free access for an additional 1,400 goods. The program dates to 1974. But in recent years, Congresshas approved only one- or two-year extensions. The Andeanprogram has also received only short renewals in recent years. Congress is expected to conduct a more comprehensive reviewof trade benefit programs next year.  (Reporting by Doug Palmer; editing by Todd Eastham)             ]]></raw>
