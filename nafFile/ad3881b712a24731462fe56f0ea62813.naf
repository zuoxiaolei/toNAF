<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The euro was steady against the U.S. dollar on Friday, after the release of strong German trade balance data, as markets awaited the release of an additional German economic report as well as U.S. employment data later in the day. EUR/USD hit 1.3269 during late Asian trade, the session high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3254, edging up 0.06%. The pair was likely to find support at 1.3160, the low of May 1 and resistance at 1.3306, Thursday's high and a more than three-month high.  Official data showed that Germany's trade surplus expanded unexpectedly in April, rising to EUR17.7 billion from a surplus of EUR17.6 billion the previous month.  Analysts had expected the trade surplus to narrow to EUR17.2 billion in April. Meanwhile, the dollar came under broad selling pressure ahead of a higly anticipated U.S. jobs report later in the day.  On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance last week fell by 11,000 to 346,000, compared to expectations for a decline of 12,000 to 345,000.Jobless claims for the preceding week were revised up to 357,000 from a previously reported increase of 354,000.The data came one day after weak U.S. private sector jobs data lowered expectations that the Federal Reserve would begin to unwind its asset purchase program this year.The euro was also steady against the pound with EUR/GBP inching up 0.06%, to hit 0.8494.   Later in the day, Germany was to produce official data on industrial production, while the U.S. was to release government data on nonfarm payrolls and the unemployment rate.               ]]></raw>
