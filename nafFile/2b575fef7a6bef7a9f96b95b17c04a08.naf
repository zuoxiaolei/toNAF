<raw><![CDATA[ * Traders nervy ahead of Athens vote on austerity package * Risk taking takes a backseat, US ISM index due this week * Dollar index is breaking above downward trendline * Nikkei off 1 pct; S&P 500 may test support at 200-daymoving average * Brent oil futures down 1.6 pct, falling below $104/barrel (Updates)	 By Kevin Plumberg	 SINGAPORE, June 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose for afourth consecutive session and equities fell on Monday, withinvestors nervous ahead of a Greek vote on unpopular austeritymeasures this week that may sow stronger doubts about financialstability in Europe.	 Greek lawmakers began debating a 28 billion euro ($40billion) package of measures to increase taxes and cut fiscalspending that is critical to winning a new round ofinternational funding to keep it afloat. 	 A rejection of the austerity plan could greatly worsenpressures already reflected by rising Portuguese and Spanishgovernment bond yields, possibly bringing high-risk Europecloser to a chain of sovereign defaults that would blow outinterbank funding costs and place heavy stress on the region'sbanking system.	 The risk of a credit event of this magnitude is keepingtwo-year U.S. interest rate swap spreads near the widest in ayear and helping to lift the U.S. dollar out of a downtrend thathas lasted a year. 	 "Contagion would run through government bond markets and viainterbank funding markets," said Societe Generale economistsabout the implications of a "no" vote from Greece. "Such anegative scenario would threaten not only the financialstability of the euro area, but the global financial system withsevere consequences for the global economy." 	 In the background, the world's major economies are at avulnerable stage, as growth is slowing but inflation remainshigh or even accelerating in some places, eroding returns oninvestments and leaving investors unwilling to take many risks. 	 The U.S. ISM index of factory activity due on Friday mayshow to what extent the slowdown is temporary.	 CONTAGION AND DISARRAY	 The U.S. dollar index, which measures its value against sixother major currencies, was trading above a downward trendlinethat began in June 2010. It was up 0.3 percent on the day to75.87 , on track for a fourth straight session of gains, having risen around 4 percent since May.	 The euro slid to $1.4128, down 0.4 percent and withinstriking distance of the June low of $1.4070 . 	"Markets understand that if this package isn't passed thisweek, it's going to throw European debt markets into disarrayand cause global contagion. That fear alone is generating a bitof selling today," said Greg Gibbs, strategist at Royal Bank ofScotland in Sydney.	 Treasuries gained, with the benchmark 10-year yield slippingto a seven-month low of 2.84 percent .	 In shorter maturities, the two-year swap spread over thecash market was at 28.5 basis points, not far from Friday's 29.3basis points, the widest since July 2010.  	 U.S. S&P 500 index futures were down 0.2 percent ,suggesting a lower open on Wall Street. The cash market, whichclosed at 1,268.45 on Friday, was at risk of testing its 200-daymoving average which is about five points below there.	 A further break below the 2011 low in March of 1,249.05would probably attract more selling.	 Japan's Nikkei share average closed down 1 percent ,with technology equipment makers the biggest drag on the index. 	 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was down 0.9 percent , with technology andcommodity-related shares the biggest losers.	 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.7 percent , thoughthe China Enterprises index of mainland stocks bouncedfrom intraday lows after posting the biggest daily percentagegain in a year on Friday.	 Asia is home to some of the most well-capitalised banks inthe world, though investors kept selling shares of Chinesebanks, many of whom are trading at single-digitprice-to-earnings ratios based on 12-month expectations, ThomsonReuters StarMine showed.	 China Construction Bank's Hong Kong-listed shares were down0.9 percent , underperforming the broad market, andIndustrial and Commercial Bank of China was down 0.3 percent .	 The financial sector globally was trading at 9.5 times its12-month forecasts for earnings, the second cheapest valuationof all the sectors, right in front of energy stocks.    	 U.S. crude kept a bearish trend in place, with the Augustfuture falling 0.9 percent to $90.26 a barrel , near lastThursday's four-month low of $89.69. Brent futures were down 1.6percent to $103.41 .	 Commodities have been the weakest link among asset classesvulnerable to a selloff in the face of slowing in industrialactivity globally. Oil prices have been slashed by a fifth sinceMay.
