<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com – The U.S. dollar was down against the Swiss franc on Monday, falling to a daily low as risk appetite sharpened after Ireland requested a bailout, easing fears over sovereign debt contagion in the euro zone.USD/CHF hit 0.9882 during European morning trade, a daily low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.9887, shedding 0.34%.The pair was likely to find support at 0.9762, the low of November 15 and resistance at 0.9996, last Friday’s high.On Sunday, European Union finance ministers endorsed Ireland's request for a three-year package of loans, totaling approximately EUR80 billion, opening the way to formal negotiations on a package of loans from two European lending facilities and the International Monetary Fund.The Irish government bowed to pressure from other euro zone governments, who were worried that Ireland’s debt problems would spread to other vulnerable euro zone nations, such as Spain, Portugal and Greece.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble said on Sunday that Ireland "will have to meet strict conditions," without naming specific measures before adding "one can't be certain" that an Irish bailout would relieve the pressure on other struggling euro members.Meanwhile, the Swissy was down against the euro, with EUR/CHF gaining 0.19% to hit 1.3592.Later in the day, discussions between Irish officials and EU and IMF representatives were due to begin.             ]]></raw>
