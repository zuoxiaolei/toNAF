<raw><![CDATA[ * Dollar index at 1-year low, euro at 2009 high * Dlr diversification, long-term status at issue * China data boost economic recovery hopes  (Recasts, updates prices, adds quotes and comment, changesbyline and dateline. Previous: TOKYO) By Jamie McGeever LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a one-yearlow against a basket of currencies on Friday, as continuedconcern over its long-term value further soured the near-termtechnical picture and meant there was no let-up in the selling. The dollar index was firmly on track for its steepest weeklydecline in almost four months, and the euro its biggest weeklygain in the same timeframe as it hit a 2009 high of $1.4627. Generally strengthening Chinese economic data also fueledhopes of global economic recovery hopes, which tempted investorsaway from the dollar and into riskier, growth-linked currencies. A U.S. Treasury official on Friday said it makes sense forChina to diversify its huge stockpile of foreign exchangereserves, which on the margins fed the bearish dollar sentimentthat's firmly taken hold this week, traders said. "There's discussion about diversification, Fed credibility,and the re-emergence of the U.S. current account deficit," saidMichael Klawitter, senior strategist at Commerzbank inFrankfurt, noting data on Thursday that showed the U.S. tradedeficit widened in July. "All these factors weigh on dollar sentiment, and from atechnical point of view the market wants to see at least a testof the December 2008 high in the euro at $1.4720," he said. Central banks' pledge to keep the world flooded with as muchliquidity -- ie, dollars -- as needed to ensure a sustainableeconomic recovery has raised concern over the currency'slong-term value and status as the world's sole reserve currency. Improving economic data around the world, the abundance ofliquidity, and rock-bottom U.S. short term money market rateshave all tempted investors to sell dollars for other currenciesand assets like stocks and gold. At 0820 GMT the dollar index, a gauge of the greenback'sperformance against six other major currencies, was down 0.2percent on the day at 76.70, having earlier traded down at76.511, its lowest since September 2008. The euro was up 0.1 percent on the day at $1.4590, and up 2percent on the week. The dollar was down 0.9 percent on the dayagainst the yen at 90.90 yen, having hit a seven-month lowearlier of 90.69 yen, according to Reuters data.  CHINA IMPROVING Earlier on Friday, David Dollar, the U.S. Treasury'seconomic and financial emissary to China, said furtherdiversification of China's FX reserves and internationalizationof the yuan made sense. "The general issue is that China has a huge amount ofreserves and it makes some sense to diversify what you put thesereserves (into)," David Dollar told a meeting of the WorldEconomic Forum in the northeast Chinese city of Dalian.  "It's healthy to have a wide and different type of reservecurrencies," he said.  The diversification issue doesn't appear to have affecteddemand for U.S. government debt. Three auctions this week worth$70 billion went well and alleviated some fears that theappetite for U.S. government debt may be dwindling in the faceof the massive doses of supply. Economic data from Asia on Friday showed that China'sindustrial output expanded in August at the fastest rate in 12months, slightly topping forecasts and showing that it was wellon the road to recovery. On the other hand, imports and exports in August both fellmuch more sharply from a year ago than analysts had expected.  "The generally stronger-than-expected August data, with theexception of trade, show broad-based improvements in majoractivity indicators ... (which) supports our view of a continuedgrowth recovery in the second half of the year," BarclaysCapital FX strategists said in a note. The market showed little reaction to data showing Japan'seconomy grew a revised 0.6 percent in the three months to June,less than preliminary figures had shown but confirming that theeconomy has crawled out of recession after a full year of sharpcontraction.             ]]></raw>
