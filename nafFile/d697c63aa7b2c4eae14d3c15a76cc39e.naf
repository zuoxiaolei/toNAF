<raw><![CDATA[* MSCI world equity index up 0.6 pct at 297.75 * Gold hits record high; oil, other commods higher * Dollar under pressure, near 15-month low  By Natsuko Waki LONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Monday whilegold, oil and other commodities rallied as upbeat economic dataand a weakening dollar underpinned raw material prices andrelated shares. Friday's data showing a wider U.S. trade deficit and weakerconsumer sentiment weighed on the dollar, which is already underpressure from expectations that the Federal Reserve will leaveinterest rates near zero for some time to come. A weaker U.S. currency encourages investors to buydollar-priced commodities, which also benefit from expectationsfor a strong global economic recovery. Data on Monday showed Japan's economy grew 1.2 percent inJuly-September from the previous quarter, its fastest pace inmore than two years, as stimulus lifted consumer spending andcapital spending rose. [nT150510] "The (stock) market is on an uptrend which could easily takethe market another 10 to 15 percent higher till the year end.

DOLLAR UNDER PRESSURE The dollar fell 0.4 percent against a basket of majorcurrencies , holding just above last week's 15-month low,while the euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.4971 . Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig said the U.S.economy still faced significant weakness, while warning thatlarge financial institutions must be allowed to fail. Some lingering speculation that China allow the yuan tostrengthen also weighed on the dollar. The United States and China sparred over exchange rates at ameeting of Asia Pacific leaders on Sunday, pointing to trickytalks ahead for President Barack Obama when he flies to China toaddress economic tensions. "If anything, the Chinese authorities will renew the yuanappreciation trend when it is least expected and the last thingthey will do is to appear to be bowing to U.S. or internationalpressure," Calyon said in a note to clients. "The Chinese authorities are concerned about hot money flowsand do not want to give the impression that they are embarkingon an aggressive revaluation path." U.S. crude oil  rose 1.5 percent to $77.47 a barrel.Platinum  and palladium prices  rallied to theirhighest levels in more than a year.
