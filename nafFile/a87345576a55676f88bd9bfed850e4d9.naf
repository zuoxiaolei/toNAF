<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro down 0.4 percent at $1.3339 * Japan on holiday but fear of intervention caps yen * Dollar still seen pressured as Fed signals more easing  * NZ dollar slides after unexpectedly weak GDP report  By Tamawa Desai LONDON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Thursday asconcerns mounted about European economic recovery, coming off afive-month high hit against the dollar the previous day afterthe U.S. central bank had signalled more monetary easing. A survey of purchasing managers showed growth in the eurozone slowed in September while euro zone peripheral bond yieldspreads widened against German counterparts. "The market is disappointed with the PMI survey, which hascast doubt over the European recovery," said Roberto Mialich,currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan. "The market is struggling between two forces -- the Fed andslower European growth -- and investors are going to follow thedriver of the moment so trade will remain choppy." By 0932 GMT, the euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.3334, triggeredby selling from Asian accounts, traders said. That level wasnear the August high, so a sustained break below that levelcould indicate further retracement. Still, the euro was expected to remain above its 200-daymoving average near $1.3208 on Thursday after breaking above itthe previous day, climbing to $1.3441 on trading platform EBS,its highest since April. On the upside, the next target was seen at $1.3510, the 50percent retracement of its fall from $1.5145 last November toits June low of $1.1876. The euro also fell from a one-month high to trade down 0.5percent at 112.60 yen.  YEN SUBDUED Against the yen, the dollar was steady at 84.47 yen afterfalling to 84.27 yen, its weakest since Tokyo intervened in thecurrency market last week for the first time in six years.Markets in Tokyo were closed on Thursday for a national holiday. "The yen would be a lot stronger if not for intervention andthe threat of intervention," said Lee Hardman, currencyeconomist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. "The drop in short-term U.S. yields is more consistent with80 yen rather than 85 yen," he said, adding Japanese authoritieswould likely come into the market again at around 82-83 yen. Two-year Treasury yields hit an all-time low of 0.407percent on Wednesday.    Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan is set to meet U.S.President Barack Obama on Thursday for the first time sinceTokyo took action in the currency market on Sept. 15, when thedollar fell to a 15-year low of 82.87. Obama will also meet Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who pushedback against pressure to revalue the yuan as U.S. lawmakersthreatened to penalise China. Chinese markets were closed on Wednesday. The yuan extendeda rally on Tuesday to nine days, rising the most in that periodsince January 2008. The New Zealand dollar fell 1.4 percent against the U.S.dollar and slid to a five-month low versus the Australian dollar as data showed the country's economy grew just 0.2 percent lastquarter, far below expectations.
