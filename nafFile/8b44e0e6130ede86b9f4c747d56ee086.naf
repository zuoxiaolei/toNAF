<raw><![CDATA[ * US-Korea Business Council "would expect" deal this year * Congressional critics meeting President Obama * South Korea says "very limited" changes needed By Doug Palmer WASHINGTON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The outlook is good forconcluding trade talks between the United States and SouthKorea by the end of the year, despite a major setback thismonth, a U.S. business official said on Thursday. Tami Overby, president of the U.S.-Korea Business Council,said her group met Deputy U.S. Trade Representative DemetriosMarantis on Wednesday "and he continues to say a matter of daysand weeks" before the deal is sealed. The two countries plan to resume talks on the trade deal inWashington, after they failed to resolve remaining beef andauto trade issues during President Barack Obama's recent tripto Seoul for the Group of 20 summit. Overby said she was waiting to hear the date of the talksbut thought a deal could be reached by the end of this year. "I would expect that," she said. Obama and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak set the G20deadline for resolving differences about the pact, which wassigned by the countries in June 2007 but never ratified. The sticking points mainly involve U.S. auto industryconcerns that the pact does not do enough to tear down SouthKorean regulatory barriers blamed for low U.S. car sales whilephasing out remaining U.S. tariffs on South Korean vehicles. The United States also is looking for assurances outsidethe pact that South Korea's market will remain open to U.S.beef and continue to grow, after a number of trade disruptionsin the past decade. About a dozen Democratic lawmakers who have raised concernsand are pressing for other changes were due to discuss the pactwith Obama later on Thursday. South Korea conceded on Thursday that some changes may beneeded but said the scope of any revisions would be limited. Previously, Seoul resisted reopening the text of the pact,which it said could cause it to unravel by upsetting thedelicate balance of concessions on both sides. "It is not full-fledged negotiations. What is inevitable iswe need negotiations on a very limited scale to give and takewhat each side needs," South Korea's deputy minister for tradein charge of talks on the pact, Choi Seok-young, said inSeoul. The United States wants a slower phase-out of tariffs onSouth Korean cars and U.S. industry fuel economy and emissionsstandards to be automatically recognized in South Korea. Choi said any change to the tariff phase-out schedule willhave to involve changes to the text itself and is thereforeunacceptable as a matter of principle. But he left open thepossibility for discussions. The deal, if ratified by the two countries' assemblies,would be one of the largest free trade pacts ever and thelargest signed by the United States since the North AmericanFree Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico that went intoeffect in 1994.
