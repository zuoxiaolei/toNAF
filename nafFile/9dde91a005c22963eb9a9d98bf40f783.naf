<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The pound slipped lower against the dollar in cautious trade on Monday as investor confidence was dented by Friday’s weaker-than-forecast U.S. employment data.GBP/USD hit 1.5306 during European morning trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.5309, shedding 0.22%.Cable was likely to find support at 1.5198, Friday’s low and resistance at 1.5362, Friday’s high and a six-week high.Market sentiment was hit as data showing that the U.S. economy added fewer than expected jobs in March raised doubts over the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.The Department of Labor said the U.S. economy added 88,000 jobs last month, the smallest increase since June and far below forecasts for an increase of 200,000. The U.S. unemployment rate ticked down to 7.6% from 7.7% in February, but the decline was due in large part to more people dropping out of the work force.Safe haven demand was also supported after Portugal’s Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho said health and education spending would be slashed after the constitutional court blocked parts of the government’s austerity plan.The pound was lower against the euro, with EUR/GBP rising 0.32% to 0.8500.Elsewhere, sterling rose to its highest level since October 2009 against the yen, with GBP/JPY advancing 1.15% to 151.36 after the Bank of Japan began a new round of aggressive monetary easing measures aimed at beating deflation in the world’s third-largest economy.The yen weakened across the board after the BoJ conducted its first government bond purchasing operation, saying it purchased JPY1 trillion of bonds with maturities of between five and 10 years, and JPY200 billion of bonds maturing in more than 10 years.Last week the BoJ said it plans to double its asset purchase program over the next two years and extend the maturities of the bonds it purchases in a bid to achieve its 2% inflation target.             ]]></raw>
