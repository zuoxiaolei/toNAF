<raw><![CDATA[ * Ends at C$1.0040 to the US$, or 99.60 U.S. cents * Up 0.4 percent for the week * Canada adds fewer jobs than expected in March * Bond prices slightly higher across the curve (Updates to close, adds quotes) By Jennifer Kwan TORONTO, April 9 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar ended on aweaker note on Friday, tumbling away from parity with thegreenback after data showed softer jobs growth in March thanexpected. The Canadian currency fell as low as C$1.0084 to the U.S.dollar, or 99.17 U.S. cents, as investors reacted to the jobsdata, which eased pressure on the Bank of Canada to raiseinterest rates. Before release of the jobs data, it was tradingclose to one-for-one with the U.S. dollar. Canada's economy added a net 17,900 jobs in March,following gains of 20,900 in February and 43,000 in January.The unemployment rate remained steady at 8.2 percent.[ID:nN09253705] Expectations had been for an increase of 25,000 jobs and anunemployment rate of 8.2 percent. "There was some talk on the Street that the job gains inMarch would be significantly higher than the 25,000 expected bythe market. When it turned out we didn't get that level of jobgrowth in March it more or less sucked the air out of theCanadian dollar," said Millan Mulraine, economics strategist atTD Securities. "The Canadian dollar never fully recovered from thatdrop." The currency  finished the session at C$1.0040 tothe U.S. dollar, or 99.60 U.S. cents, down from Thursday'sclose at C$1.0028 to the U.S. dollar, or 99.72 U.S. cents. Itrose 0.4 percent on the week. "It's softer than expected, but not soft numbers," MatthewStrauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets,said of the employment report. "As a result, it doesn't really change our outlook on theBank of Canada or interest rates going forward. We're stilllooking for the tightening process to start in the summer ofthis year, and most likely July." Strauss added there was an "obvious knee-jerk reaction"after the soft job numbers, but he noted there was still anincrease and the data did not take away from the improvingtrend in Canadian employment. The Bank of Canada has made a conditional pledge to holdits key interest rate at a record low of 0.25 percent until theend of June, provided inflation stays tame. "This still is very much in line with the Bank of Canadaraising rates beginning in July, which the market has fullypriced in," said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC WorldMarkets. "It wasn't a barn-burner report. There were certainly somewho were looking for a stronger number ... but it doesn'tdramatically alter the fundamentals for the currency." Strauss said a firmer tone in investor risk appetite asseen in North American equities helped the Canadian dollar clawback from low levels. [.N] [MKTS/GLOB] BONDS FIRM Canadian bond prices rose after the jobs report in aknee-jerk reaction, but quickly came off their highs, Strausssaid. As well, TD's Mulraine said prices also got support fromunderlying concerns about Greece's debt woes. "Even though we've had the Greek situation on us for monthsnow, every day something happens that seems to cause somemovement in the market. Today we did have the downgrade ofGreek bonds by Fitch ... that certainly has engendered a bit ofa risk aversion trade," he said. The two-year government bond  rose 6 Canadiancents to C$99.38 to yield 1.835 percent, while the 10-year bond climbed 23 Canadian cents to C$100.75 to yield3.653 percent. Canadian government bonds outperformed U.S. issues, withthe Canadian 10-year yield 23.1 basis points below its U.S.counterpart, compared with around 20 basis points the previoussession.
