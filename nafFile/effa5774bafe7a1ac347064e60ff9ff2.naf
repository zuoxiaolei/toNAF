<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com- The U.S. dollar was modestly higher against some of its major rivals in Wednesday’s Asian session and fractionally lower against some of the other majors as traders wait for headlines out of the Federal Open Market Committee later today. In Asian trading Wednesday, EUR/USD gained 0.04% to 1.3012. During Tuesday’s U.S. session, EUR/USD traded up 0.49% at 1.3004. The euro also got a lift from decent German economic data. The ZEW index of German economic sentiment rose by 22.6 points to 6.9 in December, from a reading of -15.7 in November and the first positive reading since May.Analysts were expecting a -12.0 reading. Germany is the Eurozone’s largest economy. The dollar was also lower against several of the other "risk on" currency as GBP/USD gained 0.02% to 1.6118. AUD/USD climbed 0.03% to 1.0532 while NZD/USD added 0.02% to 0.8395. The Federal Reserve concludes its final monetary policy meeting of the year on Wednesday and with U.S. interest rates at historic lows, there is little room for the central bank to affect change on that front. However, the dollar will be in play as traders await the Fed’s sentiment on additional quantitative easing. Monetary stimulus typically depresses the dollar and drives riskier assets higher. Following the Fed meeting, the fiscal cliff will be back in primary focus. News broker during Tuesday’s U.S. session that President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner had exchanged proposals to avert the dreaded fiscal cliff. That news sent U.S. equities soaring, but the gains were pared noticeably later in the session after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid deemed solving the fiscal cliff "difficult."
