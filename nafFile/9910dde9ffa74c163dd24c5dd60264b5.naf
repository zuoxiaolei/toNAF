<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The Australian dollar fell to a six-month low against its U.S. counterpart on Friday, after surprisingly weak U.S. employment data and concerns over Spain’s financial troubles weighed on market sentiment.AUD/USD hit 0.9579 on Friday, the pair’s lowest since October 5; the pair subsequently consolidated at 0.9693 by close of trade on Friday, declining 0.59% over the week.The pair is likely to find support at 0.9579 and resistance at 0.9769, the high of May 31.Risk appetite came under pressure after the Department of Labor said that the U.S. economy added just 69,000 jobs in May, far below expectations for a gain of 150,000, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 8.2% from 8.1%.A separate report showed that manufacturing activity in the U.S. slowed in May. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index fell to 53.5 from 54.8 in April, against expectations for a decline to 53.9.The weak data added to concerns that the economic recovery in the U.S. is losing momentum, which could lead to a third round of quantitative easing from the U.S. Federal Reserve.Meanwhile, market sentiment remained vulnerable after data on Friday showed that unemployment in the euro zone rose to a record high of 11% in April, adding to concerns over the worsening of the euro zone’s debt crisis.The data came after the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds climbed to a euro-era high of 6.7% on Wednesday, as the lack of a convincing plan to recapitalize stricken lender Bankia fuelled fears that Madrid will be forced to seek an international bailout.Earlier in the week, official data showed that building approvals in Australia dropped unexpectedly by 8.7% in April, after a 6% rise the previous month. Analysts had expected building approvals to rise 0.3% in April.A separate report showed that Australian retail sales declined 0.2%, disappointing expectations for a 0.2% rise and following a 1.1% increase the previous month.In the week ahead, investors will be eyeing the interest rate decisions by the European Central Bank and the Reserve Bank of Australia.Market participants will also be watching Thursday’s testimony on the economic outlook by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke for any indications that the central bank is considering more monetary easing.Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.Monday, June 4Australia is to release industry data on job advertisements, as well as official data on company operating profits, a leading indicator of economic health.
