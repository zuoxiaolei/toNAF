<raw><![CDATA[   * Euro falls below $1.20, lowest in more than 4 years * Dollar falls vs yen after below consensus US jobs data  * Traders cite macro, model accounts as sellers of euros * Worries about Hungary's finances weigh on euro (Adds details, comments. Updates prices) By Vivianne Rodrigues NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - The euro fell below $1.20 onFriday, its lowest level in more than four years, on concernEurope's debt crisis is expanding to Hungary and as U.S. stocklosses surpassed 2 percent. Investors shunned riskier assets and bought currenciesperceived as safe-havens, such as the yen and Swiss franc, as agovernment report showed U.S. non-farm payrolls grew at aslower-than-expected rate in May. Analysts said the data disappointed investors looking for astronger figure and reinforced the view the U.S. economicrecovery may be slow.. Concerns about public finances in Hungary weighed onsentiment towards the single currency as the Hungarian forintfell to a one-year low versus the euro. For details, see "The euro was already getting hammered on worries aboutHungary and with the nonfarm payrolls not living up toexpectations, the risk trade is under assault from everyangle," said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency researchat GFT Forex, in New York. The euro fell as low as $1.1972, according to EBS tradingplatform, and in midday trading in New York was 1.3 percentlower at $1.9999. U.S. employers created 431,000 jobs in May, the U.S. LaborDepartment said, below the 513,000 increase predicted byanalysts polled by Reuters. The jobless rate fell more thanexpected to 9.7 percent from 9.9 percent in April. "It's mainly disappointing," said Vassili Serebriakov,senior currency strategist at Wells Fargo Bank in New York."The pace of the recovery in the jobs sector is not as fast assome of the optimistic expectations in the market." The dollar was about 0.9 percent lower at 91.86 yen, afterhitting a session low of 91.69 yen according to Reuters data. The yen also rose against the euro and the Australian andNew Zealand dollars. "The data is clearly risk negative and the purest currencytrades are short commodity currencies versus the Japanese yen,"said Alan Ruskin, head of currency strategy at RBS GlobalBanking & Markets, in Stamford, Connecticut. "But the mostpressing problems are in Europe." FRENCH PM'S REMARKS Selling pressure on the single currency started prior tothe U.S. jobs report, with the euro hitting its lowest againstthe dollar in more than four years after comments by FrenchPrime Minister Francois Fillon on exchange rates. Fillon said he was not concerned by the current level ofthe euro to the dollar and that he saw only "good news" in theparity between the two currencies. Later the remarks wereclarified saying his reference to "parity" was about thegeneral evolution of the exchange rate between the euro and thedollar. Still, the comments caused the euro to fall steeply alsoagainst the Swiss franc, which traders attributed to an absenceof bids from the Swiss National Bank, which has recentlyintervened to keep the franc from appreciating. Traders cited model and macro accounts, as well as centralbanks, as selling the single currency. A daily close under the 50 percent retracement of the2000-2008 euro rally at $1.2135 would be seen as a bearishsignal for the euro, technical analysts said.But hedge fund advisor Medley Global Advisors issued areport saying China is buying euro-denominated assets in orderto underpin the currency, which may have contributed to aslight strengthening in the euro against the dollar earlier.
