<raw><![CDATA[ * Limited protests outside Spain and Brussels * European union movement seen to be lacking coordination * Unrest expected to increase in the new year  By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - What should have been aEurope-wide day of trade union protests against austerity provedrelatively unimpressive, analysts say, showing the difficultiesof coordinating action across the continent. But country-specific protests look set to continue, and inmany cases intensify, as cuts begin to bite, and Europe couldwell see another attempt at organising a continental protest daysome time in the new year. Whether that will be enough to prompt governments to rollback their plans is another matter, however, with the politicaland market consensus still largely behind deficit reductiondespite some worries over the effect on growth. The main focus of Wednesday's protest action was Spain,where the first general strike in eight years had limited impactbeyond disrupting transport and some factories.  Tens of thousands of European unionists also marched inBrussels. But aside from that, protests appeared limited tosmall shows of support. European markets were unruffled. "This shows some of the problems with trying to have aEuropean-wide campaign," said Control Risks Western Europeanalyst David Lea. "People experience the economic problemslocally and protest will be on a local or country level as well.This was always going to struggle without the involvement of theFrench and German unions as well as the British."   There has been a clear autumnal uptick in strike action andunrest, but action has generally been very country-specific. French unions protested last week against pension reforms,Italian unions will march in October for tax reforms andRomanian, Czech, Polish and Slovenian workers all mountedprotests or strikes separately in recent days.    Aside from the more militant transport union, Britain'sunions are seen largely holding back from widespread actionuntil the New Year, as clarity on where cuts will fall will onlycome in the government's October spending review.  WAITING UNTIL SPRING? "They might have another try in the New Year atEuropean-wide action," said Lea. "The Spanish unions havealready said they won't have another general strike beforeChristmas. I think rather than an autumn of discontent, a springof slightly more discontent is probably what you are looking atat this stage." IHS Jane's European security analyst Carina O'Reilly saidshe believed the Spanish demonstrations on Wednesday, withoccasional barricades and scuffles, had been quite successful,at least in seizing media attention. Unions had also shown a reasonable degree of collaborationin putting together the general strike and generally gettingmore protesters on the streets than before. "In a lot of countries, unions have enough trouble workingwith each other within the country to coordinate," she said."It's hardly a surprise that they struggle even more tocoordinate across borders." The European day of action had also suffered from the factthat outside Spain, where the national issues were well defined,it was far from clear exactly what protesters were marchingagainst, she said. Looking ahead, O'Reilly said Romania was the most likelycountry where protests could change policy, given governmentfragility and unpopular police pay cuts that could makecontrolling demonstrations challenging. Firms with premises in European city centres would bereviewing their security, she said -- although what action theywould take would vary from country to country. "In London, if you're a bank with large plate glass windows your insurance premiums are already pretty heavy but youwouldn't need to do much more," she said. "In Madrid, Paris,parts of Eastern Europe, they are probably going to go up. InAthens, I'd get some serious shutters." (Editing by Mark Trevelyan)             ]]></raw>
