<raw><![CDATA[* Medvedev takes aim at oil tsar Sechin, Putin ally * Government official: proposals looks "cosmetic" * Investors: implementation will be key  By Guy FaulconbridgeMOSCOW, April 1 (Reuters) - If Russian President DmitryMedvedev wants to convince the world he has dared to split withPrime Minister Vladimir Putin, he may have to show more mettle. Medvedev's call for oil tsar Igor Sechin and other Putinallies to relinquish their posts as board chairmen of statecompanies has stoked speculation he may be challenging hismentor ahead of the March 2012 presidential election. It sent a strong signal, but Medvedev has floated vaguerversions of the same idea since he was steered into the top jobby Putin in 2008, so the real test is how far he succeeds inwhittling down their influence in practice. Many investors and analysts believe Russia's head of stateand its most powerful man are enacting an elaborate charade togive the impression of competition in a tightly controlledpolitical system. "I'm still of the view that the gap between Putin andMedvedev is much smaller than a lot of people think. The successof both of them depends on stability," said Roland Nash, chiefinvestment strategist at Verno Capital in Moscow. "There is good reason to portray a sense of conflict toenable them to execute their agenda. I don't believe we areseeing some massive split in the duopoly. But the evidence maybe accumulating against me." Medvedev's demand for the removal of ministers from statecompany boards came 10 days after he chastised Putin, indirectlybut clearly, for comparing the U.N. resolution authorisingWestern airstrikes in Libya to "medieval calls for crusades". Putin responded to the Libya criticism by saying calmlythere was no division between him and Medvedev on the issue. Butif Medvedev challenges the powerful clans which support Putin,he could provoke a backlash. The stakes of taking on Deputy Prime Minister Sechin, theinformal leader of a group of powerful former security serviceofficers and conservatives around Putin, are huge. Russia is the world's largest commodity producer and Sechinoversees energy and industrial policy. He has been board chairman at state-controlled Rosneft,Russia's biggest oil company, since 2006, and has built it intoa global energy major as well as organising the  now blocked $16billion share swap between BP and Rosneft.  COSMETIC OR REAL? Ejecting officials such as Sechin and Finance MinisterAlexei Kudrin from the boardrooms of Russia's national championsby mid-year certainly appears like a bid to curb the economicclout of Putin's allies. But even if Sechin is removed from his unpaid post atRosneft, he may continue to wield influence. One senior government official told Reuters Medvedev'sproposal would be taken up but would have little impact. "Since we have been told to, we will have to go," said thesource, who sits on the boards of some state-controlledcompanies. "But this measure is cosmetic because the governmentwill still issue key directives." So why do it and why do it now? Some suspect the Kremlin's political managers are trying totoughen Medvedev's image ahead of the election to dispel fearsof stagnation. "This has been done just to attract people's attention tothe elections, to create a whirlpool," said a source in theRussian oil industry. "There is nothing really behind thisinitiative but PR." Putin is viewed as Russia's most powerful man despitestepping down as president in 2008 after serving the maximum twoconsecutive terms allowed in the constitution. They have said they will decide together which one of themwill run for president in 2012. Medvedev's announcement on shaking up boardrooms was made ina sharply critical speech which amounted to a dissection of thegrowth of the state's role in the economy during Putin's2000-2008 presidency. The Kremlin chief said endemic graft was driving capitalflight and called on Gazprom and pipeline monopoly Transneft toslash costs, which he said were higher than competitors becauseof corruption. "The grip of corruption is not weakening: it is holding theeconomy by the neck," Medvedev said. "The result is obvious:money is fleeing." Investors said that, if successful, Medvedev's plans couldresult in some of the vast state-controlled companies whichdominate the oil, gas and financial sectors of Russia's $1.5trillion economy focusing on profits rather than politics. "This is a very credible measure and if achieved it would befantastic but that is the question that the market may becynical about," said Jochen Wermuth, managing partner of WermuthAsset Management which has $300 million under management. "I do not know whether Putin and Medvedev are laughing ateveryone for thinking they are separating," he said. "Their gutinstincts do seem to be different."
