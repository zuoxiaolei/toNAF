<raw><![CDATA[ * Merchant shipping capacity increases as demand falls * Productivity suffering * Falling freight rates add to overcapacity woes  GENEVA, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The world shipping industry isstruggling with overcapacity and falling productivity in theface of the economic downturn and shrinking world trade, a U.N.agency said on Tuesday. "As the world's shipping capacity continues to increase evenduring the economic downturn, the industry finds itselfconfronted with a surge of oversupply and tumbling charter andfreight rates," the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD) said. At the same time ship operators are having to deal with anupsurge in piracy, particularly off the Somali coast and in theGulf of Aden, and with efforts to reduce carbon emissions fromships, it said in its Review of Maritime Transport 2009. With scrap metal prices at relatively low levels, vesselowners prefer to hold on to their ships rather than laying themoff, despite overcapacity, UNCTAD said. UNCTAD said growth in international trade slowed to 3.6percent in 2008 from 4.5 percent in 2007, to an estimated 8.17billion tonnes of goods loaded, with dry cargo accounting fortwo thirds of that. UNCTAD cited a forecast by shipping broker Fearnleys thatworld seaborne trade would contract by 1.4 percent this yearthen grow 2.0 percent in 2010, while Clarkson Research Servicesexpects dry cargo volumes to fall by 4.4 percent this year. Overcapacity is leading to falling productivity. In 2008 the average deadweight tonne of cargo-carryingcapacity transported one tonne of cargo over 29,300 nauticalmiles in 2008, or 194 km per day, UNCTAD said. This is expected to fall below 28,000 tonne-miles in 2009. "The fundamental reason for the decline in averageproductivity in recent years is the oversupply of tonnageavailable, which contrasts with the reduced growth in worldseaborne trade," UNCTAD said. The surplus tonnage of oil tankers, dry bulk carriers andgeneral cargo ships rose to 25.9 million deadweight tonnes, or2.9 percent of the total world merchant fleet in April this yea?????------------  ------------  ----------------  31/Dec   GB        Delta PLC                            PRELIM          31/Dec   GB        Graphite Enterprise Trust PLC        PRELIM        --------  ---- ----- -----------------------------------  ------------  ----------------  05/Jan   IE        CRH PLC                              TRADE         --------  ---- ----- -----------------------------------  ------------  ----------------  06/Jan   FR        Sodexo SA                            Q1 SALES        06/Jan   NL        Sligro Food Group NV                 FINAL OUTPUT    06/Jan   GB        Cape PLC                             TRADE           06/Jan   GB        Domino's Pizza UK & IRL plc          Q4 TRADE      --------  ---- ----- -----------------------------------  ------------  ----------------  07/Jan   DE        Praktiker Bau- und Heimwerkermarkte  TRADE           07/Jan   NO        Komplett ASA                         DEC SALES       07/Jan   GB        Caledonia Investments PLC            TRADE           07/Jan   GB        J Sainsbury PLC                      TRADE           07/Jan   GB        JD Sports Fashion PLC                TRADE           07/Jan   GB        Persimmon PLC                        TRADE           07/Jan   GB        Hays PLC                             Q4 TRADE        07/Jan   GB        Rathbone Brothers PLC                TRADE         --------  ---- ----- -----------------------------------  ------------  ----------------  08/Jan   FI        Finnair Oyj                          TRAFFIC         08/Jan   IS        Icelandair Group hf                  TRAFFIC         08/Jan   SE  0900  rnb Retail and Brands AB             DEC SALES       08/Jan   GB        Michael Page International Plc       YRTRADE       --------  ---- ----- -----------------------------------  ------------  ----------------  11/Jan   DE        Air Berlin PLC                       TRAFFIC         11/Jan   CH        Sika AG                              YRSALES       --------  ---- ----- -----------------------------------  ------------  ----------------  12/Jan   AT        Austrian Airlines AG                 TRAFFIC         12/Jan   BE        Kinepolis Group NV                   FINAL OUTPUT    12/Jan   FI        Tekla Oyj                            Q4              12/Jan   DE        Deutsche Lufthansa AG                TRAFFIC         12/Jan   DE  0700  Metro AG                             TRADE           12/Jan   NL        Rood Testhouse International NV      YRTRADE         12/Jan   NL  0600  Oce NV                               PRELIM          12/Jan   CH        Bossard Holding AG                   YRSALES         12/Jan   CH  0600  Geberit AG                           YRSALES         12/Jan   GB        Computacenter PLC                    TRADE           12/Jan   GB        Interserve PLC                       TRADE           12/Jan   GB  0930  Signet Group PLC                     TRADE         --------  ---- ----- -----------------------------------  ------------  ----------------  13/Jan   DE        Dr Hoenle AG                         FINAL           13/Jan   DE        Douglas Holding AG                   FINAL           13/Jan   DE        Ceotronics AG                        Q2              13/Jan   DE        CropEnergies AG                      Q3              13/Jan   ES        Vueling Airlines SA                  TRAFFIC         13/Jan   SE  0600  rnb Retail and Brands AB             Q1              13/Jan   CH        Barry Callebaut AG                   Q1              13/Jan   GB        Diploma PLC                          TRADE         --------  ---- ----- -----------------------------------  ------------  ----------------  14/Jan   AT        Agrana Beteiligungs AG               Q3              14/Jan   BE        Delhaize Group                       Q4 SALES        14/Jan   FR        Stallergenes                         YRSALES         14/Jan   FR        Pernod Ricard SA                     TRADE           14/Jan   FR        Carrefour SA                         Q4 SALES        14/Jan   DE        Sinnerschrader AG                    Q1              14/Jan   DE        Andreae-Noris Zahn AG                Q1              14/Jan   DE        Suedzucker AG                        Q3              14/Jan   ES        Banco Espanol de Credito SA          Q4              14/Jan   CH        Huber & Suhner AG                    YRSALES         14/Jan   CH        Sulzer AG                            YRSALES         14/Jan   GB        Filtrona Plc                         TRADE           14/Jan   GB        Halfords Group Plc                   Q3 TRADE        14/Jan   GB        Hilton Food Group Plc                TRADE           14/Jan   GB        Home Retail Group plc                TRADE                      ]]></raw>
