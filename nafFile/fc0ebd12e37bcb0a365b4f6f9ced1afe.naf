<raw><![CDATA[ * Euro drops below 100-day moving average to around $1.4090 * ECB official: Europe aid fund may have to be doubled-paper * Asia ex-Japan stocks fall 2 pct on Greece, US recoveryworries * Samsonite tumbles 11 pct on debut day in Hong Kong (Recasts, adds byline and bullets, updates prices)	 By Kevin Plumberg	 SINGAPORE, June 16 (Reuters) - The euro fell sharply onThursday after a European central banker said the bail-out fundfor the region's debt crisis should be doubled to 1.5 trillioneuros, accelerating a pullback from riskier assets that knockedAsian stocks to near three-month lows.	 Nout Wellink, governing council director of the EuropeanCentral Bank, told Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad thata new Greek aid package would carry so many uncertainties andrisks that a doubling in the bail-out fund would be necessary totake into account the contagion risk for both Ireland andPortugal. 	 The comments knocked the euro below $1.4100 and cut to theheart of fears that problems Greece faces with its black hole ofdebt could spread to other countries at a time when the U.S.economy may be slowing, the Federal Reserve's $600 billion bondpurchase programme is ending and some investors are secondguessing emerging market assets in countries such as China.	 The euro was down 0.5 percent to $1.4094 by earlyafternoon in Asia, having fallen almost 3 cents so far thisweek.	 The U.S. dollar index , which tracks its performanceagainst six other major currencies, rose 0.5 percent to thehighest since May 26.	 Oil prices staged a weak rebound after dropping sharplyovernight, though volatile markets suggested crude could resumea decline before long. 	 Investors have been re-positioning their portfolios with aneye on the litany of risks ahead of U.S. data later in the daythat included May housing starts, weekly jobless claims and theFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia business outlook survey. .	 "There is very clearly an environment now in which risk isoff and to that investors shy away from obvious risk on assetssuch as equities and high beta currencies," said John Woods,managing director and chief investment strategist with CitiPrivate Bank.	 Woods told Reuters Television that he has been advising thathis clients look at local currency bond markets in Asia thathave been resilient to pressures coming from the euro zone andstill offer relatively high yield.	 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said he will form anew cabinet on Thursday and seek a vote of confidence from hisfractious Socialist party to push through a harsh austeritybill, as riot police battled tens of thousands of protesters inthe heart of Athens. 	  UNCERTAINTY MAGNIFIED	 Greece must pass a new campaign of tax rises and spendingcuts to receive a new EU/IMF bailout and a 12 billion euro aidtranche that Athens needs to pay back debt that matures inAugust. But many analysts and economists believe it is bound todefault on its debt sooner or later.	 "Greece is like a Lehman Brothers situation, except acountry version," said Tanrich Securities' Vice-PresidentJackson Wong in Hong Kong. "It's magnifying uncertainty rightnow, even though most banks don't have much exposure to the eurodebt situation."  	 In Japan, the Nikkei fell 1.7 percent, withgrowth-sensitive shares such Canon and Mazda Motor underperforming.	 Other Asian markets also retreated, with the MSCI AsiaPacific ex-Japan index sliding 2.4 percent.Shares of materials and technology companies were among theweakest performers on fears of faltering global growth.	 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slumped 1.9 percent toits lowest level this year, with shares of HSBC ,Europe's top lender, falling 1.5 percent and weighing on thebroader market. 	 Samsonite International SA , the world's biggestluggage maker, dropped 11 percent in its Hong Kong trading debuton Thursday, reflecting weak investor appetite for initialpublic offerings. 	 Foreign bearishness about Chinese equities, partly overcorporate governance issues, have made investors increasinglycagey about the outlook for the Hang Seng with short-sellingseeing a pick-up to levels last seen eight months ago.	 In commodities markets, oil prices   recoveredin Asian trade after a more than 4 percent slide in the U.S.session as the rising dollar and signs of further economicweakness fed demand worries. 	 August Brent crude futures jumped more than adollar, topping $114 a barrel, in the wake of alarger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude stocks.
