<raw><![CDATA[    Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was mixed against its major rivals in Tuesday’s Asian session as traders digested a couple of economic data points released by the U.S. Monday and pondered what could come of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meeting that concludes Wednesday. In Asian trading Tuesday, EUR/USD fell 0.05% to 1.3450. On Monday, a report published by the European Central Bank said M3 money supply in the single currency bloc rose at annualized rate of 3.3% in December, below expectations for a 3.9% increase. M3 money supply in the euro zone rose 3.8% in the preceding month. USD/JPY slipped 0.09% to 90.78 as traders once again appear to be thinking the yen is oversold against the greenback and some other major currencies. Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.06% to 1.5705, the pair’s lowest since August 20. The slack British economy has prompted concerns the Bank of England will engage in some form of monetary easing that could weigh on sterling. Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to hold a referendum on the U.K.’s membership in the European Union by 2017 and those headlines were also seen as pressuring cable. In U.S. economic news, the Commerce Department said durable goods orders jumped 4.6% last month. Core durable goods orders increased 0.2%. The National Association of Realtors said its index for pending home sales fell 4.3% in December from November to 101.7. That is still almost 7% higher than the December 2011 reading. Those data points helped lift oil prices, one reason why USD/CAD is lower by 0.08% at 1.0056. USD/CHF rose 0.02% to 0.9266. AUD/USD surged 0.25% to 1.0444, indicating the Aussie may be seeing fresh life against the greenback after several weeks of lethargic trade. NZD/USD soared 0.31% to 0.8368 after data released Monday showed New Zealand’s trade balance rose more-than-expected last month. The U.S. Dollar Index shed 0.03% to 79.88.             ]]></raw>
