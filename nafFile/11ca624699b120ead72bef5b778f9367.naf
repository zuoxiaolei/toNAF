<raw><![CDATA[ (Adds detail) SYDNEY, Feb 18 (Reuters) - A top Australian central bankerpainted a bright outlook for the economy on Thursday andbrushed aside concerns that the winding back of fiscal stimuluswould restrain activity going forward. Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Assistant Governor PhilipLowe also played down fears that China's tightening of creditwould threaten its recovery and foresaw strong growth in Asiamaking up for weakness in the developed world. Speaking at an economics conference, Lowe said the centralbank expected Australia to grow by 3.25 to 3.5 percent thisyear and next, up from an estimated 2.0 percent in 2009. "This is slightly above the average of the past two decadesand, if it occurred, would likely see a gradual reduction inthe spare capacity that currently exists," said Lowe, who headsthe central bank's economics department. Lowe did not touch on monetary policy except to say thebank's forecasts were based on the assumption that the officialcash rate had been a long way below normal and would return tomore normal levels over time. The RBA slashed its cash rate to a record low of 3.0percent at the height of the global credit crunch beforelifting it to 3.75 percent in the last three months of 2009. It had been expected to hike again this month but surprisedby holding rates steady, saying it wanted more time to assessthe impact of its previous tightening. Lowe said the bank's upbeat outlook was based on a judgmentthat growth in private demand will gradually strengthen, withpublic demand providing support in the short term. Lowe singled out the labour market as a star performer withunemployment having peaked at 5.75 percent, far lower thanfirst feared. He cited greater flexibility in the labour marketas one reason for this, with employers and workers agreeing tocut hours or pay as a way of preserving jobs during thedownturn. He played down fears that China's steps to tighten lendingwould lead to a significant slowdown in the economy there,something that has been weighing on the Australian dollar. "On balance, it is plausible to argue that the recenttightening in credit conditions is a favourable development inthat it increases the likelihood that the Chinese economy is ona sustainable path," said Lowe. Indeed, he expected Asia in general to keep growingstrongly but subdued activity in Europe and the United States. That is crucial for Australia since Asia takes 70 percentof its exports. China is now its biggest trading partner, withan insatiable demand for commodities that has helped push upthe prices of iron ore and coal, Australia's two biggestexports. This was a major reason Lowe expected a strong increase inAustralia's terms of trade -- what it gets for exports comparedto what it pays for imports -- this year. That in turn was fuelling a boom in investment inAustralia's resource sector where many billions of dollars werebeing spent on mines and liquefied natural gas projects. All of which helped counter concerns that the rollback offiscal stimulus, such as grants for first-time home buyers,would lead to a fall off in economic activity, said Lowe.  "Looking forward, there remains some possibility that, withthese measures now having been wound back, activity could againslow," said Lowe. "However, as time has passed, the likelihoodof this being the case has declined." He cited evidence that spending on services, such as eatingout, had been particularly strong in recent months, which asunlikely to be the result of fiscal measures. Still, Lowe did note that the global credit crisis had madeconsumers and businesses more conservative in their spendingplans despite being generally confident about the future. "As we go forward, one of the things that will shape howthe economy evolves is how these attitudes change," he said. The financial crisis had also impacted the demand andsupply of business credit, which had fallen by a steep 7percent last year in what was usually reminiscent of recession. Lowe said the supply of credit had clearly been curtailedin the commercial property sector, but elsewhere it looked likefirms were choosing to raise equity or use cash reserves to paydown debt. "Over time, as the economy strengthens and investment picksup, a reversal of these trends would be expected," he said. Lowe said inflation had moderated last year thanks toslower wage growth, a higher currency and an increase in sparecapacity in the economy. "These factors all take time to fully work their waythrough, so we expect a further period of modest quarterlyoutcomes and thus further moderation in the year-endedinflation rate," he said. The RBA expects consumer price inflation to be around 2.5percent in 2010 and a little higher in 2011.  (Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Jeremy Laurence)             ]]></raw>
